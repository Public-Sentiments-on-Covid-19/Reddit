fhdpsal,-0.4817,-0.296,"I have never posted to Reddit or much of anywhere.  I expect I will be condemned here for lack of sources.  My information is from voiceless rural people and most likely cannot be confirmed in real time.  I came here to share common folks' stories that I feel can help people here connect their own dots.My partner is from rural Asia.  We are very active in keeping up with friends & family in China, Lao PDR, Cambodia and other remote areas in Asia where people from my partner's village have been relocated via marriage or other circumstances.I do not want to proliferate conspiracy theories or panic.   I hope to share pertinent information.I just talked with a friend in Yunnan China.  They say their people are staying indoors, not going to work, arguing among themselves and 11 people have died in their small town today.  The Lao/China border is closed.  From talking to people, I've heard that a (the?) illness is infecting many people in the aforementioned countries.   I can only find sporadic reports online.",When should we start to get worried about the new outbreak?,2020-01-20 12:32:31,/r/Coronavirus/comments/erj61t/when_should_we_start_to_get_worried_about_the_new/
