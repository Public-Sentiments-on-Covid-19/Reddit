ffg83x0,-0.2955,0.0,"Your reasoning is flawed though because you are attributing not getting sick to not having vaccines. That’s like people who say ‘oh I got a flu shot one year and ended up with flu so now I don’t get them.’ Their reasoning is fundamentally flawed since flu shots don’t cause flu, it was simply their luck that year.","When the first reported US case of the new Chinese Coronavirus is in your state, and really close to where you live",2020-01-21 12:36:26,/r/Coronavirus/comments/es0m55/when_the_first_reported_us_case_of_the_new/
ffhs117,-0.8765,0.0,"Sorry but you're being pretty selfish. Just as selfish as an anti vaxxer, in fact. You don't just get vaccinated for yourself but for the good of our community. People who can't get vaccinated rely on people like you and me to get vaccinated because they don't have a choice. Babies, cancer patients, people with immunological disorders etc. My mother in law is unable to get any live vaccine and thus relies on herd immunity. A disease can't get close enough to them if around 99 percent of people are vaccinated against it (I can't remember the actual 'critical mass' that's required for protection).","When the first reported US case of the new Chinese Coronavirus is in your state, and really close to where you live",2020-01-21 12:36:26,/r/Coronavirus/comments/es0m55/when_the_first_reported_us_case_of_the_new/
