fitrjco,-0.9515,0.0,"The COVID 19 is a betacoronavirus, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The targeted analysis of the virus’s genetic tree suggests it originated in bats. But it’s not yet clear whether the virus came directly from virus or through the intermediary animal.MERS-CoV, a bat origin coronavirus infected people via camels, while SARS-CoV, similarly a bat origin coronavirus infected people via civets. The origin source of the Wuhan coronavirus transmission is yet to be identified.Early on, many of the people affected by coronavirus transmission in Wuhan, China, were found some link to seafood and live animal market. It suggested that new coronavirus spread through animal to person. But with new coronavirus updates, the frequent cases of the people infected with coronavirus transmission even after not having exposure to the animal market indicated a person to person transmission of the novel virus.Various government agencies and public health officials are restlessly working for identifying the actual reason for virus spread, causing COVID-19.",Is bat soup cause of corona virus ?,2020-01-23 04:29:29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/essezm/is_bat_soup_cause_of_corona_virus/

fjkqpba,-0.911,0.0,"I think this is coming from the half ass fact that China tried to develope a virus that would calm down Hong Kong and make them more docile. It turned into this. They used deposits from HIV (very bad idea) and ""bat shell"". Bat shell mutates. So it keeps mutating when tranfered. Initially, it piggybacks on a flu virus, that's the 1st stage. It has, I believe up 5 stages? The 1st is the fever, tight chest, coughing. If you get past that, which seems doable, than you have to get past the nest 4 stages. They tested this on incarcerated humans in China. They found that it kills the person and decided that's not the way to go with Hong Kong. US found out and wanted to study the virus. China said no. We paid and individual for it, it got out. This is all not 100 percent confirmed. It seems like it though bc of the patients that get better than sick again. It also has 2 strains now.

fitzdis,-0.6749,0.0,"Definitely, look at the date of this article:SARS-like virus in bats could jump to humans13 Nov 2015, 01:07A newly identified SARS-like virus in bats appears to be able to jump to humans without mutation, new research suggests.However, it's not yet clear whether it would then be able to spread from person to person, the researchers said.How prepared are we?A worldwide outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 was caused by a coronavirus that jumped from animals to humans.That outbreak resulted in 8,000 infections and nearly 800 deaths, the researchers noted.Read: Symptoms of SARS ""Studies have predicted the existence of nearly 5,000 coronaviruses in bat populations, and some of these have the potential to emerge as human pathogens,"" senior study author Ralph Baric, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said in a university news release.""So this is not a situation of 'if' there will be an outbreak of one of these coronaviruses, but rather when and how prepared we'll be to address it,"" Baric added.Baric and his colleagues looked at how the SARS-like virus in Chinese horseshoe bats behaves.They found that it enters the bodies of bats and humans in the same way. The researchers also noted that this virus replicates as well as the SARS virus in primary human lung cells, the preferred target for infection.There is no treatment for the newly discovered SARS-like virus, the researchers said.The findings are important in light of ongoing debate over a U.S. government decision that considerably slows the development of vaccines or treatments for potentially dangerous coronaviruses, the researchers said.Baric said ""building resources, rather than limiting them, to both examine animal populations for new threats and develop therapeutics is key for limiting future outbreaks.""The study was published in Nature Medicinehttps://m.health24.com/Medical/Flu/Bird-flu-and-sars/sars-like-virus-in-bats-could-jump-to-humans-20151113",Is bat soup cause of corona virus ?,2020-01-23 04:29:29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/essezm/is_bat_soup_cause_of_corona_virus/

A portion of these patients will simply have the flu, while it is possible another portion of these patients will have the coronavirus.  In the case of a major outbreak, like the one occurring in Wuhan right now, it is possible that a very large portion of the patients who go in for treatment will have the coronavirus.  Those who have the flu with symptoms severe enough to go in for treatment will have a dramatically higher chance of contracting the coronavirus from other patients.Additionally, if there is an outbreak, medical resources will be strained and the probability that individuals with severe flu symptoms will die even in the absence of some other infection would also be much higher.tldr; Get your flu shot people.

Also, we manage to avoid blowing up the world economy while slowing the virus.  The fatality rate ends up being 0.5%, because hospitals manage to hold things together.So, let's run the numbers, and see what we get.7.7 billion people \* 0.7 \* 0.005 = 26,950,000 deaths.  This is the ""good"" ending.Here are some things that could go wrong:* We don't slow it down.  Everything peaks at once.  Fatality rates go to 10%.  The number of dead would be over 500 million.* We don't know what the long term effects are.  Some, maybe many, survivors might be permanently disabled and die significantly younger than they normally would have.* ADE might be a thing.  If so, then we might see a second wave where the rates go up towards 20%.  1 billion dead.* We might successfully contain the virus, but blow up the world economy while doing it.There are some upside possibilities:* The work on Ebola and SARS allows us to develop an antibody treatment in record time, revolutionizing how we treat epidemics.* The virus might spontaneously mutate into a less deadly form.* The virus has been around a \*lot\* longer than we realize and most of us have already had it without realizing it.  I mean, I will leave it to the reader to decide whether the upsides or downsides sound more plausible.What we are not facing, though, is anything that would kill 30-50% of humanity.

It might have been spreading to a large amount of people and now it's just appearing and even then its continuing to spread. I also get why jokes about the coronavirus is downplaying the severity of it. However, the best way to feel better is to joke about it. People handle stress in different ways and comedy helps. That doesnt mean that the people dont care. No matter what, you're actually spreading more awareness of this virus. People can joke and still want a serious discussion about this virus.
