fgr60e7,-0.9493,0.0,"Already more than 24,000 deaths from coronavirus?  The Communist Party of China has been accused of underreporting coronavirus cases and deaths, and late Saturday evening (Feb. 1), the Chinese news service Tencent may have accidentally leaked real data on Wuhan virus deaths, according to Taiwan News.According to the Taiwan News,  Tencent showed confirmed cases of coronavirus in China at 154,023 on its webpage “Epidemic Situation Tracker.” That number is 10 times the official figure at the time. Tencent listed the number of suspected cases as 79,808, four times the official figure.Most ominously, the death toll listed was 24,589, vastly higher than the 300 officially listed that day.The number of cured cases was only 269.Even MORE significant..QUOTE – Another strange phenomenon that netizens have noticed is the mortality rate, as the government death tolls are routinely maintaining an exact percentile for days on end. Many noticed that in the early days of reporting, the government put the death rate at 3.1 percent.Jan. 22: 17 deaths / 542 infections = 3.1 percentJan. 23: 26 deaths / 830 infections = 3.1 percentJan. 24: 41 deaths / 1,287 infections = 3.1 percentBy late January, the government apparently decided to set the new official mortality rate at 2.1 percent.

At this point, these numbers seem to be a reasonable expectation.A slightly lower rate of doubling would have a large impact. At a doubling every 4 days (based on Feb 4 - 24,000 cases) predicts:Feb 6 - 32,400 affectedFeb 8 - 48,000 affectedFeb 10 - 64,800 affectedFeb 12 - 96,000 affectedWe can all watch to see if this is what happens.

The actual doubling now is probably somewhere between doubling every two days and every 4 days as we enter the knee of the curve. Let us hope that that changes back to every six days thanks to worldwide efforts to slow the spread of the disease.

ffgxp66,-0.9345,-0.1027,The incubation period is 3-4 according to all the research coming out this week not 7-14 days actually. The reporting out of China is inaccurate because it's expected to be inaccurate. China is reporting the number of patients they've tested that show positive for infection. That is a small subset of total infections given that most people are not likely to go to a hospital when they are infected since this has a low mortality rate currently and the symptoms are similar to the flu or a bad cold for most people. The papers released are estimating somewhere about a 5% reporting rate given these factors so the real total number of infected is roughly 20x the number of verified infected which means as of Jan 24th there are somewhere around 15-20k infected rather than the 800 reported by China.The doubling rate is around 2.3 from Jan 1st through the 22nd which means the number of infected is expected to double every 2.3 days unless controls slow it down (they will at some point in the near future).Here's a good paper to start with if you want to get more info based on actual science done by people that specialize in the field versus needing speculation.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fz7EwlAJjrZs708YGPym1Xj_3PmysukL/view,"USA need to stop all international travel, to and from the country.

The sort of posts that really try to assist people with critical information at the time of need. Now, having said that , I also have done several humanitarian missions in China over the the past 20 years. In every case and place we have dealt getting the truth from the government was next to impossible. Have I seen and heard lies and cover up? Yes, I have seen cover ups , lies and whitewashing of very important facts and information by the medical system and ministry of health. We were on the ground working the Chengdu earthquake disaster in 2008 and I nearly left due to the dishonesty that our teams dealt with.   I'm not going to say that there is a cover up this time around but there is a strong history in China  of the government being far less than honest about even the smallest of issues.  At the end of the day , I agree with most of what the epidemiologist fellow has said  and the reader should protect and behave following those guidelines.
