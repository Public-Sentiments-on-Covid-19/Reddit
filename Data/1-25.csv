ffkb9vz,0.8529,0.3612,"One thing to clear up as most of us interchange the word mask with respirator. Respirators protect from exposure to airborne particles. Surgical masks are a barrier to splashes, droplets, and spit.In healthcare, Respirators protect from exposure to biological aerosols including viruses and bacteria.Respirators are designed to seal tight to the face of the wearer.Many masks are not made to form a seal so there will be air gaps all around them. Not good! They help the patient from getting spit on by the doctor but a good portion of the air you breathe in will not be filtered. So make sure you focus on Respirators or masks that seal off your face.",Overall in the USA it looks like Respirator’s Masks and Tyvek suit prices are climbing and Respirator’s / Masks are starting to sell out.

ffpux11,0.7476,0.3612,"Personal question I suspect may clear a common point of confusion for those of us less knowledgable about respirators...Long story short, is the virus a particulate or organic vapor or something else? Details/context below:My pregnant wife and I are trying to prepare outside of Boston. We have two 3m rugged half masks and have 2 spare sets of 60923 p100/ov/ag cartridges, each. If the virus reaches Boston and is being actively transmitted we will shelter in place. If I’m only using my mask a few hours a week to go shopping for essentials am I correct to think the cartridges will last for months?I’m confused about whether the virus is a particulate or an organic vapor. I’m hoping the virus is a particulate and the cartridges will last months, if needed, with minimal use. In that case I could tell if they needed to be replaced by when it got hard to breath, right? Anything I’m missing? Do we have the right kind of cartridges?Hoping it doesn’t come to this but the recent news reports are far from encouraging and things seem the opposite of under control in China.",Overall in the USA it looks like Respirator’s Masks and Tyvek suit prices are climbing and Respirator’s / Masks are starting to sell out.

fnaon32,0.394,0.3612,"I tested a P2 2125 (P95 2071) and P3 6035 (P100 7093), and the 2125 was much easier to breathe than the 6035.  I was thinking since the advertisement said 1.8 times the surface area of 2000 series, that the 6035 would be easier to breathe than both the 2125 and 2135 (2091), but I was mistaken.  I have not tried the 2135 (2091) so I don't know how the P3s compare to each other. Any thoughts on breathability?Although the pressure test and installation of the 6035 (7093) is much easier and the hard case protects the filter material. When installing the 2000 series disk, I was worried about accidentally tearing the filter because you kind of have to grab it really hard to turn.

They certainly seem to be taking it all extraordinarily seriously, Almost like they know they’ve got something terrible on their hands. You’ve seen the videos of them fumigating the streets right? That’s not going to decontaminate anything especially if it’s spread through the air. That was more likely an attempt to kill something- rats? Fleas? It is highly likely Lyme disease is a bio weapon that escaped a lab in the USA. It spread along the migratory bird paths. The lab in Wuhan was a source of concern in 2017, with experts fearing diseases could accidentally escape into a dense population.

ffl5x3x,-0.9798,0.0,"Look at the cases of death in both SARS and this new virus. Both have been predominately Chinese. Let's humor your idea of this being China's doing. How on earth were they going to stop the spread of this virus to their own people once it was out there? If they release a vaccine locally, the world would notice and the entire world would demand them to share it. You can't covertly get a vaccine out to the entire population without someone outside noticing. Besides if you think biochemically, it is way more feasible to engineer a virus that targets a people, say the Chinese. Politically speaking, in light of recent events and the new cold war, it wouldn't be far fetched to say that if this was a bioweapon, the US is most likely responsible. Then you have to think, what about SARS? possibly MERS?  China, Middle East. Hmm. Now **I don't know the truth**, but the US has been doing shady shit all around the world, the ""elites"" definitely have been able to justify commiting some horrific acts sacrificing thousands if not millions of innocent civilians. This all sounds conspiracy theoryish but you can't reject these possibilities just because it collides with mainstream thought which is obviously shaped.

However, human error could easily be a factor in accidentally releasing the 2019-nCoV to the public. The questions I would ask are: how are the test subject animals disposed of when they die? How do they sanitize and clean the instruments and dissection tools and surfaces that come into contact with dangerous viruses?

I have questions about quite a few things; I don’t know how many family members of yours have medical issues, such as high blood pressure, heart disease. How do you go to hospital during the shutdown, also how can you even reach out to hospitals when the hotline is now jammed. For example, if you suspect you are now infected with the virus, you can’t even be diagnosed due to shutdown of the transportation. Hospitals in Wuhan are now crowded, nobody will pay attention to you after waiting in line for multiple hours. Perhaps you aren’t infected, after waiting for multiple hours will result in cross infection. Now let me say something that I’ve witnessed. Before Jan 22, only small percentage of people in Wuhan wore face masks, enormous amount of citizens were still playing mahjong in mahjong store, talking with their friends without face masks. I want to discuss with you, what are those officials (titles of officials have mentioned) doing, weren’t they informed? If they were informed with first-hand information, what’s the deal with no press conference at all, not even official announcement about citizens need to wear face masks compulsively and asking them to be on guard against the virus? If they weren’t informed, which indicates they are derelict in their duty, and shouldn’t they be fired due to signs of not being suitable for their job. Is my way of thinking flawed?  After the quarantine in Wuhan kicked in at 2am on Jan 23, there are only pamphlets about compulsive wearing of facemasks posted in our communities. From Jan 23 to Jan 25,t he number of people wearing facemasks has been increased, which implies Wuhan citizens aren’t ignoring the outbreak of the Wuhan virus, it implies relative government departments haven’t taken any action to deal with the outbreak, or they have ulterior motives. I won’t discuss what they are hiding from us, I can only sum up the mainland China government are now repeating the mistakes that they had suffered in 2003(Outbreak of SARS). One can even suggests that the situation is a far worse than 17 years ago. Shutdown has now leaded to inconvenience (not able to buy food/see a doctor). Rumor of gas station shutdown has been spread recently, I have yet to experience, so I don’t know the validity of the rumor. Medical system is now overloaded and orderless, my friends who are medical staff told me that the medical treatment you will get is anti-inflammatory pills and injection of hormone, no one is capable to help you, the only outcome is death. If you are healthy and strong enough, you will survive, if not, then you are simply gonna die. The most fucking outrageous and ridiculous thing is, if you are a suspect of carrying the virus, you are told to go home and quarantine yourself, due to lack of coronavirus test strip or medical equipments aren’t up to standard. WTF! Are we even able to find other countries more full of shit than China? Even there’s a slim chance of you turning out as a carrier of the virus, you should be able to undergo a much more competent medical treatment than this. Medical department has now publicly tell citizens can self-quarantine even if one of those guys who were told to quarantine yourself turns out to be infected, which leads to faster cross transmission rate. As a normal people, no way you are more proficient than medical staffs. You can’t even find another countries act as idiotic as the Chinese government. We may lie in order to survive, but I must open my chest and tell some truth. Wuhan is just a living hell right now. It was supposed to be developed into another New York, suggested by the great Sun Yat-sen. Now, it is just a shitshow. There are videos on twitter which showed people with familiar faces and familiar accents collapsed and died, it is a genuine tragedy. Jan 25, the first day of the lunar New Year is supposed to be joy and heartwarming family greetings (拜年), as of right now, every Chinese are now scared of their life in such joyful day. I want to address something, people who share similar background and age around 20-30, not a single one is an utter idiot or brainwashed. We know the truth, the so-called “expert” are only capable of fooling kids. We all know how rotten this country is, we just have no way and capability to oppress the dictatorship. We are made of flesh and blood, we can’t win over bullets and tanks. I urge everyone that was reached to help us, we just want exposure to create public pressure, to force the Chinese government not running away from their responsibility and not to guide us how things should go from places ,Qinghai (青海省), that’s fucking far beyond from Wuhan. Don’t treat us as some dumbfuck. Fuck the Chinese government. Let’s trade our positions, if someone who is related to you suddenly catches the Wuhan coronavirus, not due to them ignoring guidelines preached by the government or the medical department, it’s due to lack of actions from the government. They can’t receive the right treatment and can only suffer. There’s no second life. Most importantly, it is most commonly spread between an infected person and others via: the air (from viral particles from a cough or sneeze); close personal contact (touching or shaking hands); an object or surface with viral particles on it (then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands); and rarely from fecal contamination. End of part one. I am Exhausted, sorry for broken English.*Tldr: Official reports from China is invalid, POV from a citizen in Wuhan(current situation is fucked,no one is receiving the right treatment, mental breakdown and FUCK the Chinese government for hiding and misleading important facts about the virus and how to deal with it)","Citizens in Wuhan are asking the globe to help, this needs more attention",2020-01-25 07:45:07,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ets9yr/citizens_in_wuhan_are_asking_the_globe_to_help/

Millions of workers already travelled back to their homeland at the start of the year, they could carry the coronavirus, spreading all over the country. How can the government deal with this? Should we quarantine the whole country? Instead of containing here and there, why didn’t you address any useful information at all? I’m risking my freedom and my personal wellbeing to states how fucked the situation is. We are the innocent, we are frustrated at how they singlehandedly risking all of our lives for something that is so counterproductive. Some of us aren’t brainwashed like others. We hope we can come from places with democracy and freedom, to spread awareness via social media. But we simply can’t, we have no idea how to help fight this epidemic without repercussion. It is crystal clear that when there is something wrong, the higher up just leech from ordinary people.

Now that the virus has been identified in Europe and America as well we can see wether or not it seems to spread quicker/be more aggressive than what has been described to us From China. If we don't see it spiral out of control with tens of thousands of infected within a a week or two at most then i dare say the fearmongering regarding 100k infected in China is just that.

From the information I get (maybe it’s wrong) French experts think there is no use to wear a mask cause they are useless.However, Chinese doctors suggests us to wear FFP2 or medical mask (IIR2) in public place to avoid the infection.Also based on the interviews this flu is lethal but only 5% on general. So it maybe not that dangerous.BUT what I am worrying is that the infection rate of this flu is so high that may take so much medical resource to quarantine people. And there are many visitors from China that we are not totally sure about their situation.For me it’s better to avoid bad things happen before we get some certain information.But actually all the 3 cases in France are all Chinese or overseas Chinese, maybe this flu only influence Asian people for some genetic reasons?
