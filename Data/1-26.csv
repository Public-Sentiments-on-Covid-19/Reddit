ffrz1g6,-0.9867,0.4019,"Transcript:> Hello everyone> I hope everyone who is watching this can cherish this video.> Because it is very difficult to post anything online right now.> In mainland China, well, you know, we need VPN and all kinds of stuff, and there's severe Internet latency.> So I've got no other choice but to seek help from here.> Hope there's Chinese comrades and people with kindness can watch this, and be aware about this Wuhan Pneumonia, so called ""Coronavirus"" pandemic.  The severity of the situation, and the actual living condition of us Wuhan people.> Right now the entire Wuhan has its entire transportation system, public transport halted, all of them.  For example, gas stations are no longer in service.> And I've had a few questions, for example, perhaps one of your family members has something like a high blood pressure condition or heart attack, and needs to go to the hospital immediate.  How do we do that?  Calling the emergency hotline 120, you can try it, it simply doesn't get through.  Just doesn't get through at all.  Always busy.> Another example, you suspect that you might have contacted the pneumonia, you go to the hospital to get checked, but you can't get there at all.  Hospitals are packed.  The doctors don't tell you to get registered or anything, you just have to line up.  You might have to wait hours in line and still can't get treated.  Perhaps you were fine before, but after queueing up for hours, you get contaminated.> And then I'm going to talk about something I saw with my own eyes.  One day before the day Wuhan is locked down, as well as before (January) 22nd, in the entire city of Wuhan, there weren't much people wearing masks.  There were just a bunch of people waking around, playing mah-jong, chitchatting everywhere, interacting with street vendors.  I've got a question for us to discuss in this public platform:  What the hell had the Wuhan mayor and the Party committee secretary been doing?> As a local government official, did they not receive any information?  If they had indeed received any first-hand information, why did they not take any action?  For the entirety of the press conference, why did they not urge us to immediately put on a mask?  To at least increase our public health awareness?  If he did not receive any information, then he has neglected his duty, and he simply isn't fit for a job of a local government official, and should have been sacked a long time ago.> Am I not right?  Is my logic flawed?> It is only on the 23rd, when Wuhan was locked down, that we finally have some sort of flyers all over our place, flyers to demand everyone wear a mask, and then from the 23rd to the 24th and now 25th, we finally started seeing people wearing masks.  So it is not about the citizens refusing to wear masks, it is about the local government not doing anything at all, or maybe they even have some ulterior motive.  As for what motive, let's not discuss about them.  We can only say that in this pandemic, even after the 2003 experience, we are just repeating our mistakes, and the current situation is definitely just as bad as the 2003 SARS, if not worse.> If you want to go outside, to get checked, all of the public transportation is stopped.  If you want to drive yourself to the hospital, there are no gas stations for you to refill at.  Though I don't know for a fact that the gas stations stopped operation, I've heard it from the Internet, and did not check it myself, so this is still speculation.  > Then, the whole picture for the current situation is that medical service is completely paralyzed, or should I say, in total chaos.  I have a lot of friends who work at hospitals say that if you enter a hospital, they'll just give you some anti-inflammatory drugs, or some hormone injection, or to put it bluntly, you are just left for dead.> If you are strong, you might make it through.  If you don't, you're dead.> And the worst thing is some of the ""suspected cases"" are just as good as confirmed, but they ran out of test solutions or something like that, or they simply don't have enough resources or manpower to test it.  They'll tell you to go home and isolate yourselves.  I want to fucking ask, can you find another country on this planet to be such fucking bullshit?  Even if you are suspected to have contracted the disease, not to mention those who are confirmed to have been diagnosed, you should at least get some form of medical treatment, right?> How can they just toss you away like that?> If you are a super-spreader, then, doesn't that mean that the government, or the medical facility has just told you to carry the virus all over the place?  And cross-contaminate everyone?> As a regular citizen, no matter how well you know about medical knowledge and how well you isolate yourself, you won't be as well-informed as the hospital staff, and won't be isolated as safely.  Can you find another country on this planet, another government, to fuck shit up like this?> I'm here on YouTube, with this video.  I don't have any ulterior motive.  I simply  think that in one's lifetime, there will always come to the time when you must speak out the truth.  Sometimes in life, you have to inevitably lie to survive or for whatever reason.  But in some specific occasion, for example right now, I think it is necessary to speak out the truth with your own heart and conscience.  Wuhan is like the fucking hell right now.  It used to be a very civil place.  The place where Mr. Sun Yat-sen started the revolution to overthrow Imperial China.  He fired his first round here.  It was suggested to build Wuhan like the current New York, a modern city.> But now?  What does it look like now?> You see all kinds of pathetic, ridiculous, outrageous, tragic, every moment you can see videos on twitter or other social media, some familiar roads of Wuhan, or someone with a Wuhan accent, some random person just drops dead or all kinds of scenarios All those tragedies are just happening on the first day of Lunar New Year.  It was supposed to be a festive happy day we all celebrate But now, do you think us as Wuhan people, or as Chinese can feel happy?> And I hope that all overseas Chinese can understand one point.  We the Chinese, at least my friends in our 20s and 30s, are not dumbasses, are not brainwashed.  In our brains we all know it clearly> [Reference to a political scandal]> We can ignore that and make fun of it.  But we are all fucking know what this country really is.  We just have no ways, no power, our bodies are made of flesh and blood.  We can't beat full metal jackets and tanks.> I hope every single overseas Chinese who can watch this video, can help us.  You don't have to spend a dime or do anything.  You just tap with your finger, get the message out.  I'm not making a living out of this.  I just want to create some public pressure to make the Chinese know not how to escape their responsibilities.  They escaped all the way to some random shithole island in Qing Hai, to act like they are giving instructions to deal with the pandemic.> Instructions my ass, are you thinking everyone else is retarded?  Fuck you.> Now, we as people could think in other's positions,> right?> Imagine you are a Wuhan citizen right now.  If you are living on this land.  Your family, your friends, all the people you know.  Suddenly contracted the disease.  It's not like they refused to cooperate.  But they just have no way to get any medical treatments.  Can't even get diagnosed.  They can only sit there and be tormented by the disease and eventually death.> A man only lives fucking once.  You've only got one life.  > Once you're dead, it's all over.> And this virus, it's not causing symptoms as the officials said, fever, cough, or whatever.  Even if you have no fever and no cough, you can still have the disease.  And it's not only through oral transmissions.  You can also get it through your eye mucus.  This is already confirmed.  Many medical> staffs have already confirmed this.  > And one month before the lockdown, During the New Year> rush, a million or two already have left Wuhan.  What about those people?  How do you prevent them from spreading the disease?  Are you going to lock down all of China?> Lockdown this, lockdown that.  What the fuck have you been doing before this?> So I hope everyone who can watch my video can treasure this video as it was really difficult to upload.  I have been risking getting caught by the police all this time.  Trying to get the truth out.  We are really helpless.> Not all of us are brainwashed.  We, too want to live the life with democracy and freedom.> Open.> And we wanted to browse the internet without having to use a VPN.> But we just can't, what can we even do about it?  Right?  High housing cost, living cost, inflation.  Whatever happens to the rank-and-file politicians, they'll scrape benefits off us peasants, and we can only watch.> All of the friends around me, as long as they are rich or have the ability, they would fucking migrate the very moment they could.  None of us are dumb, we just have no power.  I urge you guys to help, at least right now, we the Wuhan people really need the international pressure and awareness.  We are really too helpless.  > Just one word:  helpless.Hand-typed, some obvious grammatical corrections.

A suppressed immune system makes for a vulnerable person. I’m sure you’ve heard it before but a lot of infections get cleared up before we even notice them because the immune system clears them so quickly they don’t have the chance to reach the point where they’re with so many (viruses) that they starts to do damage.

ffposna,-0.9975,-0.7283,"Confirmed infected is different from sick... They just don't know until symptoms show and they go in and get tested. If you read any of the literature there are like 30k suspected awaiting tests 2k confirmed and a whole lot of others they classify as some other cold or flu. It is the peak of cold and flu season after all. So everyone with the sniffles is freaking out, understandably, but reporting number responsibly requires time and testing. Something this virus is not playing nicely with. Looking at the lancet article this damn thing is a shitty bug. 2 week onset while contagious (possibly) then a 6-8 day ""oh shit"" symptomatic period, with almost no way to treat it except experimental treatments, limited efficacy antivirals, and cold packs until the person's organs shut down. People act like there is anything that can be done for those who are sick right now... In China, not a lot. But China just isn't stocked for this kind of thing. That is a conversation for another time, but they need to deal with what is on hand now. Could of, would of aside; what do they do now? Keep people from moving around, keep them separate, quarantine the sick. Test everyone you can, with as many kits as you have... But think about that. If a week ago I told you I need 1 million pennies in 5 days you would be hard pressed to round them up... Even if you had the cash and Banks were open. Now imagine each penny as a complicated test kit for a specific disease that you just found out about a month ago.  And realize to test Wuhan alone you would need 11 times more pennies to test everyone. Y'all are Monday morning quarterbacking this thing without seeing the complexities.  This is some crazy scary shit and panic is a real issue that only makes things worse. Of course things like testing the dead when you don't have enough kits for the living is an issue and burning the dead...

Idk.In terms of fatality rate, total cases, incubation time and transmission rate, everything points to ""really really bad"" and as we're reliant on China for official numbers, there's a possibility this is much more worse- more cases, more fatalities, higher fatality rate, higher transmission rate.But at this point it appears you've reached a critical mass of cases, with a strong suggestion quarantines were largely ineffective in China and cases have gone international. So you have people busy airports, big cities, walking around with a highly transmissible virus without showing symptoms for a whole two weeks? That's really bad news.Maybe it's overly cautious, but if I were elderly or were immunocompromised or had a respiratory disease and in the US I'd probably be vigilant, not go outside or wear an N100 mask. Especially until it's clear there's a handle on total cases and it's not exploding upwards.There's a strong desire not to look stupid. But given the dormancy period, by the time there's a substantial number of confirmed cases, the number of infected will be astronomical.I'm tough so I'm not as concerned, but if new information develops suggesting someone in my city is infected I'll probably take significant precautions.","Asymptomatic man infects 14 medics with coronavirus.

ffpn31f,0.9895,0.128,"I worked in an immunology lab for 4 years, I have a chemical and biomolecular engineering background, and work as a process engineer on a clinical phase immunotherapy drug (FDA new drug application submitted, so soon commercial phase). One of my closest professors was a virologist too, so I have good working knowledge of immune response to viruses.That being said, to be clear, I don't have an epidemiology background.This is going to be very bad, as others noted. BUT theres something super important to realize. I'm assuming you live in a developed country in the western world. We have different social customs than most of Asia, particularly when it comes to hygiene and personal space. I don't mean that as a knock on any culture, it is just a fact. Europeans and Americans just don't stand on top of eachother in the subway or in mobs at ticket counters like they do in China. We also spit a lot less and wash our hands a lot more. These cultural differences all add up to different infectivity profiles in different regions - and ours will almost certainly be lower than theirs.In addition, \*on average\*, our hospitals are better equipped to treat critical patients. Wuhan is a very big city though, and I'm sure they have some fantastic academic setting hospitals with top-line care as well, though. But clearly they are overburdened to the point of being ineffective (see first point about rate of spread).The big question is how much lower will infectivity be in developed western countries. If significantly lower, we'll be okay. If not, we will have massive, massive problems.I live in the USA and I stocked up on masks and canned food today, FWIW. Better safe than sorry. I live downtown in a major city though.","Asymptomatic man infects 14 medics with coronavirus.

ffpqckb,-0.992,0.128,"I'm a physician and though I haven't done clinical work (meaning work with patients) for some years, I still work in legal cases. The bad things about this virus are: 1) no early information by Chinese authorities (they allowed it to spread), 2) novel virus so we (the world) didn't know how it worked, 3) RO is 3-5 (meaning 1 person will infect 3-5 of every 10 people he or she comes in contact with). This is according to early studies; the value of the R0 may be found to be different later as more cases are included in the statistical analyses. This is higher than SARS, which has R0 of 2.8.4) Mortality reports are 3-10% of the severely ill. We still don't know what percentage become severely ill. Remember: we have only seen lethal cases in China...Mortality depends not only on how bad the virus is but also on the quality of healthcare, overall population health, availability of resources and previous knowledge about the disease. Large amount of patients with an unknown disease (novel) face a higher mortality. SARS mortality has become lower with time, as we have learned about it. Ebola patients in Africa had a much higher mortality than those treated outside Africa because healthcare and resources were poor or scarce and pre-infection health of patients was bad (e.g. bad nutrition, etc).5) long period of incubation (up to 14 days)6) transmission of the disease is possible during the incubation period (meaning before symptoms happen) allowing ""seemingly healthy"" infected people to spread the disease'7) the 21st century allows movement of massive amounts of people fast around the globe...which means that in less than 24 hours large amounts of people with the virus (and no symptoms at all) can find their way to another country.Soldiers traveling from Europe to the Americas, returning from war, are though to have been a major factor in spreading the influenza virus that caused the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.The only good thing about the virus is: it's NOT airborne, it's spread by droplets, which is slower than airborne transmission. (ok it's bad but it's not as bad!).Is it an apocalyptic event like in the movies (Contagion, Virus, etc? We don't have enough information to know for sure (and that's terrible) but it's lethal and easily spread enough to be of concern. What I think is that regardless of the pandemic definition by the WHO, maybe it's time to call it a global issue, be more aggressive in keeping the sick away from the healthy population (examples: quarantine, travel restrictions, etc), and providing the zone with ill people with resources and personnel to take care of sick people and take care of the healthy ones,  until the problem is solved. It's called containment.Just in case, I have goggles, masks and gloves (and of course lots of soap!) in case it hits my area. And if it comes to my area, I will buy tons of non-perishable food and try to go out as little as possible. Luckily, there are no direct flights from Asia arriving anywhere close to me.","Asymptomatic man infects 14 medics with coronavirus.

I in no way shape or form specialize in immunology and disease vectors or anything of the sort.My take? - this is going to be very very bad.Reasons ?1) China lied/lying about original outbreak - this is the most important part. They lied which allowed the virus to reach out further2) asymptomatic period. Biggest factor here. Too many people can be infected with having no idea, for too long of a period of time. Basically it’s a bomb with a 2 week timer, and that person spreads bombs during 2 weeks with no clue. To continue the analogy, you now have a mass terrorism issue as a large portion of the population is actively exploding (dying, becoming very ill) and actively making other people spread and explode.3) the misinformation of deaths/chinas response. Videos we see cannot be verified, but chineese citizens risk a lot by uploading anything remotely bad. I highly doubt there’s  a large volume of people who speak Chineese clearly with Wuhan dialect taking time to stage multiple fake videos in real facilities.

The population density is high AF in almost all 4 metropolitan cities(Delhi and Mumbai just two cities has more population than the whole of Canada) plus if something happens the ratio of doctor to patient is unimaginable because even though I live in a city people who are on tier 2,3 cities are going to manage but villages don't get access to healthcare during normal times( they make almost 65% of the population),let alone during epidemic.Even though I am worried about me and my family but we will have access to everything and world class medical care,I am worried about the millions who can't afford (we are talking about literally millions I'm talking double digit or may be triple digit).even though it not as bad as they show in slum dog millionaire, it's still a shit show compared to all other countries ,you know what even china.trust me in  India other than major cities,it's going to a fuck fest.It's a hard pill to swallow but India is doomed,I know may sound anti-nationalist but it's time people wake up.i too had so much hope when growing up and it gradually died right in front of my eyes. Even if nothing happens the population explosion is real and we are running out of resources and the pollution is going out of control and on top of this, the majority of population is racist, Islamaphobic, trans and homophobic and bigot who are just bunch boomers who won't listen to the facts and just thinks God is gonna save them all.I know I'm rating it got out of control.For the first time my thoughts are inked. some may even called my be a spoiled brat,yes I am so thankful for all the resources I grew up with which on par with almost first world countries yet my mind can't process the fact that India is beyond redemption. Yes we may seem like we are developing country yet it is just the cities,my hope for it becoming a developed country died when I was as small as 14, I'm 21 now.a 14 year old can see the problem but government can't because they are too busy fighting casteism (our version of racism but the government is on the side of whites so imagine ) and stealing money from the same people. The very small % of the people who see this for what it is,they are trying very hard to get out of this shit hole before it goes into chaos.P.s I'm not sorry if I offended anyone's opinion,it's facts mf ,wake the fuck up.","Asymptomatic man infects 14 medics with coronavirus.

ffs1bxe,-0.7263,0.5815,"Exactly! One aspect I haven’t heard anyone address is that many, if not the majority of viruses, lay dormant even after the body fights them off then can resurface later and become contagious. i.e. mono/epstein bar, chickenpox/shingles, EBV, HSVThese Novel Corona virus survivors may not have symptoms anymore, or be contagious for months/years, then when their immune system gets run down they become contagious again. There was as a new case confirmed in AZ and I heard there are cases in San Francisco confirmed that will be coming out in the news soon. It’s also infuriating they keep down playing that only older people are dying of it, so not a concern for the majority even if it does spread.  We know that many viruses cause chronic disease i.e. cancer or hoshimotos, even if you get over the initial sickness from the virus.  Who knows how debilitated the survivors will be longterm from this mutating bat virus.  China confirmed a “possible” mutation 5 days ago. If China is going to even bring this up, then the answer is - yes, 100% it mutated. - Even though the CDC announced today it has not mutated in the US. - From our few confirmed cases... that means nothing. Those with confirmed cases, and their close contacts, should be quarantined indefinitely until they figure out more information on this virus and what the implications of these mutations are, or come up with a vaccine.   All countries with the means should be building separate hospitals like China is - as we obviously already know how this is going to play out.",Looks like Samoa and Fiji are smarter!!!
