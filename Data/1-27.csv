This will compound the medical issues since people will flee the area looking for food and shelter. In turn this will lead to more infections and greater hardships.  I really don‚Äôt understand why everyone is taking this so casually. As another post pointed out, if the mortality rate is similar to the common flu (2-3%), many more (100k+) are already infected based on reported deaths. If the mortality rate is higher than the common flu, than well, that‚Äôs not good either.

ffqpqpq,-0.3244,-0.296,"In order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, villagers across China, principally in rural areas, are blocking the roads and streets (the entrance of villages) with branches and other materials and even guarding the area wielding knives, spears, swords and other sharp weapons.During this period of the year, a lot of tourists cross those villages and family and friends of the villagers go to visit them. They are also prohibiting the villagers from visiting their families, and blocking the passage of public vehicles, subway stations and etc.The majority of Chinese people on the internet seem positive about those attitudes, while others not so much.Ym soon commented: ""When the government does nothing, the people naturally have to take self-protection measures. In this extraordinary period, excessive or even extreme measures are better than loosening! Life is off, who can afford to lose?""Grace ooi commented: ""Seeing these photos, I was in a paradoxical mood, happy and sad. I ‚Äôm glad that the uncles and aunts finally raised their awareness of prevention. Sadly, the epidemic is serious."" (Uncle and Aunts refers to 40+ years old people).**\[Translated from Chinese\]**Source: [China Press](https://www.chinapress.com.my/20200127/%e2%97%a4%e6%ad%a6%e6%b1%89%e8%82%ba%e7%82%8e%e2%97%a2-%e4%b8%ad%e5%9b%bd%e5%86%9c%e6%9d%91%e5%b0%81%e8%b7%af%e7%a6%81%e5%85%a5%e8%ae%bf-%e6%9d%91%e6%b0%91%e6%89%8b%e6%8f%a1%e5%85%b3%e5%88%80%e6%8a%8a/)There are lots of photos, although I could only put one. It's happening in a lot of different places across China. They are using knives, spears, swords and even shotguns, rifles, snipers. Other villages are using branches, stones, trucks in order to keep outsiders away, I will link some reports, the sites are Chinese but you can see the pictures there or translate it. People are also reporting it in online Chinese forums.Chinese sites talking about it:[Stheadline](https://hd.stheadline.com/news/realtime/chi/1689207/%E5%8D%B3%E6%99%82-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B-%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E5%85%A7%E5%9C%B0%E8%BE%B2%E6%9D%91%E5%B0%81%E6%9D%91%E7%A6%81%E8%B7%AF%E9%98%B2%E7%96%AB%E6%83%85%E8%94%93%E5%BB%B6-%E6%9C%89%E6%9D%91%E6%B0%91%E6%89%8B%E6%8F%A1%E9%97%9C%E5%88%80%E6%8A%8A%E9%97%9C) (Chinese kids guarding villages using fire weapons).[Bastillepost](https://www.bastillepost.com/macau/article/2651623-%e5%85%a7%e5%9c%b0%e8%be%b2%e6%9d%91%e5%b0%81%e8%b7%af%e9%98%b2%e7%96%ab%e6%83%85-%e6%9d%91%e6%b0%91%e6%89%8b%e6%8f%a1%e9%97%9c%e5%88%80%e6%8a%8a%e9%97%9c) (More photos).Hundreds of Chinese people are reporting how it is being in their villages. Some of them aren't sealed, others only check body temperature before allowing people in and others are very strict and don't even allow villagers, who went to celebrate the Chinese New Year, in. Those villages are relying on their own grown crops/animals and hunting wild animals such as rats, armadillos, monkeys, swans, frogs and whatnot.Also people are reporting that masks are too expensive in some places, one single common mask is 36 yuan (about five dollars), but it's not even easy to find, what resulted in people not using masks in those villages, so they are very strict about letting outsiders in. Not even ambulance and police are allowed. Most of bus lines are not working and some highways are blocked (illegally).You can check those reports and photos here: [Baidu](http://tieba.baidu.com/p/6461090253?pn=1)",Villagers close roads and guard with knives and spears in rural areas.

These characteristics have been tracked in hundreds of outbreaks over the past century. One worrying exception was the Spanish Flu pandemic that crisscrossed the globe several times over the course of a couple of years right after WWI. Many, many diseases have followed this same path. The difference is that today we have far more sophisticated methods to detect outbreaks early and to diagnose victims quickly.I'm not saying this situation is if no concern; what I'm suggesting is that this new understanding of the progression of newly emergent disease has uncovered old phenomena we didn't know about before and this can- and certainly to some extent has- led to mass hysteria and fear.The good news is this early detention coupled with modern immunization technology gives humanity a much better chance of minimising the effects of a modern repeat of Spanish Flu, and it's important to keep in mind that the current coronavirus is very unlikely indeed to become another deadly global pandemic on the scale of the Spanish Flu.","I'm from Wuhan, sharing Chinese social media screenshots about ""10k"" and ""100k"" infections",2020-01-27 10:25:09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eurz99/im_from_wuhan_sharing_chinese_social_media/

China knows they fucked up and leaked a bio-weapon and honestly I'm glad they at least had the sense to shut those cities down but obviously too little Faaaaar too late. Now I'm shifting my anger to US health professionals who are telling us ""business as usual"" when it's pretty clear thousands if not millions have been exposed. The people getting sick right now are the people who originally came from Wuhan between two days (or whenever the quarentine started) and two+ weeks ago. The problem is for. The last 2 weeks those supposedly healthy but now sick people have been infecting countless more people who are currently without symptoms but likely contagious. That means today even if you feel fine you may sit next to someone on the bus *who also feels fine* but let's say he was in LAX last week same day someone came in from Wuhan. He is contagious but not symptomatic yet. Right now as in today the third wave I people are being infected. Let's say only 1000 people came into the US from Wuhan before they quarentined. Each one of them infected roughly 3 people gives us 3000 contagious people today who are each infecting another 3 people gives us 9000 by the end of the week. Unless the CDC immediately orders house arrest nation wide and closes the roads/ports/airports it's only going to continue to grow exponentially. Knowing this country trump won't do that till at least the Superbowl by which point there will be tens of thousands of sick people all over the country and possibly 60% of them will die. Even worse they may decide to postpone nation wide house arrest and we end up with Spanish flue level where most everyone is infected and we loose like half our population leading to complete social breakdown and gang rule which mad Max might seem fun until you realize there are nukes out here... fuck were fucked why the fuck haven't we even closed the airports yet",This thread is full of conspiracy theorists ?,2020-01-27 12:53:27,/r/Coronavirus/comments/euu8ah/this_thread_is_full_of_conspiracy_theorists/

fftn58a,0.5113,0.2235,"Exactly. It's gone international so there's not much the Chinese government can do to hide the rate of infection or death. Although spring festival's mass migration helped spread the disease, it also (I'm completely speculating) probably pushed authorities to attempt to report accurate numbers because they know, like what eventually happened with SARS, that not only their own citizens but the world is watching. The national government has already thrown the Wuhan authorities under the bus for incompetence early on, so now all blame or success will be attributed to the national government. It's actually in their interest to report all deaths and infections now so that they can then make it seem like they've done such a great job containing it later on. Hence the livestreams of prefabricated hospitals put up in a week, the quick but likely ineffective ban on wild animal trade, and massive quarantines that will slow infections but only after 5 million people already left Wuhan.","China isn't hiding the numbers, the infrastructure to give accurate numbers are not there",2020-01-27 17:38:44,/r/Coronavirus/comments/euyelk/china_isnt_hiding_the_numbers_the_infrastructure/

It's a hotel which hosts only people for work, and its the security sector so we'll be alright. But everyone is talking about it. Everyone. Every 15 minutes i hear something in the halls.The way things look, people outside of china are recovering just fine. Better resources, more room and attention to each person infected. I think thats the real issue china has... no room, no resources, so people have to fend for themselves. Furthermore, many people over there are older and smoke quite a bit. That doesn't help pulmonary disease. Luckily the rest of the world began looling down on smoke around 2010, so many people have quit smoking. But we'll see. I know for damn sure that this virus will spread to just about everyone... it's impossible not to considering the incubation period. First cases found in cities around the usa... we'll see more infections by friday. By next month, if no serious action is taken... we'll see the same shit here that we do in China.
