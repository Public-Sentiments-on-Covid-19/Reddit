fft0ect,-0.9802,0.0,"[Event 201](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/about) (centerforhealthsociety.org)**About the Event 201 exercise**Event 201 was a 3.5-hour pandemic tabletop exercise that simulated a series of dramatic, scenario-based facilitated discussions, confronting difficult, true-to-life dilemmas associated with response to a hypothetical, but scientifically plausible, pandemic. 15 global business, government, and public health leaders were players in the simulation exercise...**Purpose**In recent years, the world has seen a growing number of epidemic events, amounting to approximately 200 events annually. These events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society. Managing these events already strains global capacity, even absent a pandemic threat. Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global—a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences. A severe pandemic, which becomes “Event 201,” would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions.Recent economic studies show that pandemics will be the cause of an average annual economic loss of 0.7% of global GDP—or $570 billion. Similar to the Center’s 3 previous exercises—Clade X, Dark Winter, and Atlantic Storm—Event 201 aimed to educate senior leaders at the highest level of US and international governments and leaders in global industries.It is also a tool to inform members of the policy and preparedness communities and the general public. This is distinct from many other forms of simulation exercises that test protocols or technical policies of a specific organization.**Recommendations**The next severe pandemic will not only cause great illness and loss of life but could also trigger major cascading economic and societal consequences that could contribute greatly to global impact and suffering. The Event 201 pandemic exercise, conducted on October 18, 2019, vividly demonstrated a number of these important gaps in pandemic preparedness as well as some of the elements of the solutions between the public and private sectors that will be needed to fill them. The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, World Economic Forum, and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation jointly propose these recommendations.[Video coverage of Event 201](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/videos.html)","""In October 2019, a group of 15 business people, government officials, and health experts gathered around a table in New York to plan out the global response to a worldwide outbreak of a never-before-seen — and completely fictional — coronavirus.""",2020-01-28 00:06:42,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ev2o8v/in_october_2019_a_group_of_15_business_people/

fftjov9,-0.9188,0.5439,"hey there! Im a public health epidemiologist and I am here to help! If you are a healthy individual who is considered by your physician **not** to be immune compromised, you are fully capable of fighting this virus off. You would be surprised but learning more about viruses will help mitigate your anxiety. That is where I come in. I have posted in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/etmbmi/perceptions_from_an_epidemiologist_on_ncov_2019/). In short, viruses have an incubation period, which is the time from a person contracts a virus to the time they first start to show symptoms. During that time, the virus will usually remain subclinical meaning that it is working away in the background, trying to enter your cells and change their DNA. When your body starts to show symptoms, that is because it has recognized that something is not right with how your body and cells are functioning. Coughing and sneezing are a natural biological function triggered by your immune system to expel foreign agents. Unfortunately for viruses, by the time you start coughing and sneezing,  it has already begun doing its damage. Now to keep yourself protected, the virus is spread via droplet on saliva projectiles with you sneeze or cough. It is also transferred on hard surfaces and through touching others. That said any sort of mask to cover your face will do just fine. There are a lot of people talking about N95's and full face shields but these are only truly necessary for health care professionals working in close proximity to infected patients. This is because they often have to provide oxygen and other gases that take those droplets and nebulize them into smaller particles. As a person in the general public (I assume), to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses, including coronaviruses, you should follow usual health precautions such as:* washing your hands often* avoiding contact with people who are sick* practising proper cough and sneeze etiquette (sneezing into your elbow and washing your hands afterwards)There are no specific treatments for coronaviruses, and there is no vaccine that protects against coronaviruses. Most people with common human coronavirus illness will recover on their own.If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see your health care practitioner. They can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication.You should also:* drink plenty of fluids* get rest and sleep as much as possible* try a humidifier or a hot shower to help with a sore throat or cough","I‘m actually super scared of the corona virus and how it will continue in the following days.

Could be an outbreak of something like this getting worse, could be a snowstorm, power outages, financial issues, civil unrest, whatever.

While masks and hand hygiene go a long way, quarantining the sick takes that percentage into the range we need to be in. If you're currently healthy and your city is quarantined, just stay home. If you're sick but doing okay, call the hotlines we'll be setting up before you leave to seek medical attention and if they tell you to stay home, STAY HOME.

ffua5zd,0.9348,0.8433,"Thank you for sharing this. This is very interesting. The hypothetical complexity of the system begins with the south america which isnt nearly as densely populated as china or their neighbor India. Both of these populations are vastly greater than south american megacities. So throw out any numbers that you may have for results of an outbreak. Second, is control of the spread. I did not see control of the breakout just that it was a breakout. This is important because the timing at which a breakout happens would play a hefty roll. Such that, if the breakout was contained for the next 3 months and then suddenly breaks out worldwide, our chances of having a vaccine or potential vaccine would be greater. Especially if it is fast-tracked as is being discussed right now. Fortunately, the 2019.ncov genomes have already been [mapped](https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/24/dna-sleuths-read-coronavirus-genome-tracing-origins-and-mutations/)d, and are  available to the public. This places us at a much higher chance to find a potential treatment quickly. This may not have been accounted for by the model.I'm thinking the model predicts a very possible hypothetical cause of potential breakout but its ability to access the full range is wildly inaccurate, both in a good and bad way.

Recently, the Center for Health Security has received  questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current  novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health  Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop  exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic,  but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the  exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that  would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting  that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people. Although our  tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used  for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not  similar to nCoV-2019.","Figured I’d post this in here: Comparing the STRIKING similarities of the Event 201 Scenario (created in October by John Hopkins Center of Health Security) to what is going on today with 2019-nCoV.

ffv1bpa,0.8638,0.296,"Reposted due to misleading title - thanks for pointing it out u/slypothosIn a major breakthrough in the global fight against coronavirus, scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the disease.Key points: Australian scientists have become the world's first outside of China to recreate the coronavirus The discovery will enable scientists to develop a test to identify people who might be infected, even before they show any symptoms It will also help speed up work towards a vaccine for the disease, which has claimed more than 100 lives in China and infected five Australians Described as a ""game changer"" that will help scientists determine whether a future vaccine is effective, experts at Melbourne's Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity on Tuesday became the world's first scientific lab outside of China to recreate the virus.They will now share it with the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Europe, which will in turn share it with labs worldwide — including one from Queensland — involved in the worldwide race to develop a vaccine.The team of scientists grew the virus from a patient who had been infected since Friday.The ABC was in the lab the moment scientists discovered they had successfully grown the virus, with Mike Catton, the co-deputy director of the Doherty Institute, confirming it with three words.""We got it,"" he said. ""Fantastic.""Dr Catton told the ABC the discovery was ""vitally important"" and would become a critical part of the tool kit to show if vaccines work, with scientists able to test any potential vaccine against a lab-grown version of the disease.It will also enable researchers to develop a test to identify people who might be infected with the virus, even before they show any symptoms.Right now in Australia, patients with initial coronavirus symptoms undergo testing in hospital, with samples sent to the Doherty Institute, the only lab in Australia that can test samples a second time and give a 100 per cent answer about whether someone is infected or not.But this could all change following Tuesday's discovery. Doherty Institute lead scientist Julian Druce, who was there with Dr Catton at the moment of discovery, described it as a significant development in the global understanding of the virus, and for the response to it.""This will be a game changer for other labs within Australia,"" Dr Druce said.Growing the virus will also help experts understand more about how coronavirus behaves.The Doherty Institute is the second lab in the world to recreate the disease. A lab in China was the first, but did not share its discovery with the WHO.However, the same lab released images of the genetic sequence of the disease, which helped scientists at the Doherty Institute recreate it.Dr Druce said scientists at the institute had been working hard to understand more about the illness, which has already claimed at least 106 lives in China and infected another 4,200 people worldwide.""It's been 10-12 hour days, 2:00am finishes; so it's been pretty full on,"" he said.""We've designed and planned for an exercise like this for many years. This is what the Doherty Institute was built for.""And that's really why we're able to get an answer from Friday to today [of] diagnosis, detection, sequencing, and isolation.“Dr Catton, who is also the pathologist supervising at The Doherty Institute, said Australian scientific facilities were well prepared to deal with outbreaks like the coronavirus.""This virus qualifies as a three out of four, so it's a level three virus and that's based off our understanding of SARS (sudden acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome), which are its close cousins,"" Dr Catton said.""It's dangerous, it does kill some people, but it hasn't got the lethality that viruses like Ebola do.""But he said early diagnosis of a disease outbreak like the coronavirus was important because it gave health authorities around the world a better chance of containing its spread or, at the least, its severity.What is different is how much more mobile the world is, he said.""I'd still say we're alert but not alarmed,"" Dr Catton said.""We shared the view of national health authorities that it was likely there would be cases in Australia. That didn't happen with SARS, which is a similar virus.""I think it's something like 150 million visits more each year with China to countries like Australia than was true back then”At this stage, coronavirus does not have a death rate as high as SARS.""SARS we know had a death rate — a mortality rate — of about 10 per cent. This [coronavirus] appears to be 3 per cent; my personal opinion is it will turn out to be lower than that,"" Dr Catton said.Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said in Australia there has been no known human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus.""There is no cause for concern in the Australian public, there is no human to human transmission of this virus,"" he said.""It's important to note because we had some media [ask] about masks today; there is no need for the Australian public to wear masks.""Those who have the illness are being kept in isolation.All Australian-based patients are in stable conditions.",Coronavirus re-created in Australian lab.

ffvlx3q,-0.9092,0.0,"By my guess it seems h1n1 isn’t too severe on symptoms while Wuhan Corona supposedly causes pneumonia which is pretty bad. It’s a correlation of ability to kill to rate of infection. Wuhan Corona has been infecting at a graph similar to a log graph meaning 2000 cases can quickly become 10000. Considering it’s only been a month these infection numbers are seemingly going to soar. It also seems more difficult for medical professionals to treat because the pneumonia combined with sheer amount infected in China makes it difficult. In the US we didn’t have this problem because they isolated and treated the people nearly immediately before it spread and the numbers became radical. Overall, I think the panic is coming mainly from the potentiality it has because high contagiousness and high ability to kill beats out high contagiousness and low ability to kill. Also I think because it was a flu it was likely easier to solve because influenza viruses are similar meaning normal flu vaccines already have a strong topic basis, but a SARS more MERS vaccines exist to create a basis for the Wuhan Corona virus.",Coronavirus vs H1N1,2020-01-28 18:55:14,/r/Coronavirus/comments/evgnf0/coronavirus_vs_h1n1/

ffwy0ey,-0.996,-0.34,"Based on what we do know right now there is cause to be concerned.R0 estimates put this at 2.2-5. In perspective that ranges from slightly more contagious than the flu to much more contagious than the flu.Conservative mortality rate estimates put this at 2.5%. This is still a huge unknown with the virus but 2.5% is really bad on its own. For comparison the flu has a mortality rate around 0.1%.This thing is at least as contagious (probably several times more contagious) as the flu which has spread around the world and become ubiquitous everywhere. It is also many times more likely to kill than the flu.If the overall case mortality rate really is 2.5% and we expect most of China to become infected then we are looking at ~300,000 deaths in China alone. Spreading to India will result in similar numbers.The big issue at play now are what the R0 changes to after implementation of countermeasures. For context SARS started around a 3.0 and dropped to a 0.49 after countermeasures were introduced.Our best option was to quarantine this while it was small and prevent its spread. China failed miserably at that. Our next best bet is slow spread as much as possible for as long as possible while vaccines are researched and produced. SARS was a small outbreak and countermeasures that slowed spread were enough to defeat it. However that window has closed for nCoV2019. The infected numbers are too high to control with quarantines.As it stands right now nCoV2019 is going to kill tens of thousands in China even if countermeasures are successful, and has the potential to kill millions worldwide mostly from poor countries that lack sanitation/medical infrastructure and pack millions of people into small areas in cities.The only thing that can stop this from hitting the millions case is a vaccine.

ffw9a1f,-0.1779,0.0,"Med student here.No doubt glycated proteins play a role in the infectiousness of nCoV2019. However, that doesn't mean reducing sugar intake will help lower your risk of infection, for two reasons:1. It's the glycation at the origin of the virus particle that would matter; so the blood sugar levels of whoever infected you.2. If you lower your sugar intake, your body will start to produce glucose by itself (= gluconeogenesis) from proteins and fats, since your body cannot function on only fats, proteins and ketones; so glycation will happen anyway.Lastly, the effect is going to be very small if it exists at all. Basic hygiene measures (washing your hands with running water and soap or rubbing on hand sanitiser for ≥ 30 seconds, not picking your nose, not rubbing your eyes, staying away from coughing people) are proven to dramatically reduce your risks of catching any coronavirus, including nCoV2019.","Question: Keto and Coronavirus, does my research make sense?",2020-01-28 21:43:45,/r/Coronavirus/comments/evimnj/question_keto_and_coronavirus_does_my_research/
