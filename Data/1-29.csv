ffxe60c,0.7947,-0.3818,"I mean, there are highly-qualified experts claiming a much lower estimate, and by insisting there cannot be less than 100,000, you're basically saying you think you know more about this than those highly-qualified experts.This isn’t a matter of confirmed facts at this stage. There are a range of well-informed guesses and a range of uninformed guesses. Picking which informed guess you agree with based on your own uninformed perspective doesn’t necessarily mean you think you are smarter than the people behind the other informed guesses. You would have a point if this were something where there is expert consensus and there were people denying that consensus without evidence, but we are pretty far off from that stage.Edit: To be clear, I personally think 100,000 sounds perfectly plausible.

ffwkvrg,-0.9209,-0.3818,"Your thinking is flawed. The time is delayed. People who were infected 3 weeks ago are dying now. So you need to look and see how many cases there were back then. If there were only 1,000 then 106  / 1000 is about 10% fatality rate. (Just an example. I've seen calculations using this method vary from 5% to 15%).Right now there are over 6,000 infected globally. So in a week or two, we might see another 600 from that group die but, if the rate of infection remains stable (+50%/day), there could be a million people with Coronavirus within the next two weeks.The issue is that death rate increases as medical staff and resources are depleted. And underreporting becomes a huge issue. Right now, we're not seeing a lot of new data come out of China because they're out of test kits. So the numbers they're tracking are ""\~6,000 confirmed cases, \~10,000 suspected cases"".

ffxpq4q,0.9266,0.2577,"Hello, this is Qiushi. Right now it’s January 27, about 9 in the morning. Yesterday, that is the second day of the [Lunar] New Year, I did the following things. During the day, a local Wuhan web friend took me to go shopping at a large local Wuhan supermarket. I saw locally that there is still a very adequate supply of common necessities such as meat, poultry, eggs, milk, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar. The prices were also very reasonable, no cause for situations of mad plundering. However, many drugstores were not open so buying masks and disinfectant was a big problem. Later at night, I went to the infamous Huanan Seafood Market. The whole place has been sealed off. There was caution tape put up and security on patrol. So I talked to the security guard. Security says the shop fronts overlooking the street here generally sell seafood, but the stalls further inside…those are bustling and lively with things like foxes, monkeys, pangolins, anything and everything. Furthermore, the local nouveau riche indeed have the practice of consuming wild game for nourishment [and building up vitality]. Also, the security guard said, “Aren’t you afraid to be here? Even the Wuhan folks are too afraid to come here. Don’t you see the cars going around [to avoid this place]?” And then I discussed with the security guard a bit of gossip about the owner of the Hunan Seafood Market. He said the owner has a lot of clout. Look at how close this place is to the train station at the center of the city. He was able to secure this place and open an urban farmer’s market. For so many years, people wanted it torn down but just couldn’t do it. Just some gossip.And then at 11:30 or so at night, I went back to Wuhan No. 11 Hospital. Why did I go back to the same hospital? Because the transportation is paralyzed, I couldn’t get a ride. I am using Mobike [an app-based bicycle-rental company] bicycles as transportation, so I could only cover a range within these few kilometers. I’m very sorry. When I got to the hospital, I found out that on the second day of the [Lunar] New Year, that is yesterday, the number of patients looking to get treated clearly reduced by a lot compared to the day before yesterday, first day of the New Year. The long queue disappeared. And also, there was a lot of empty seats. The hundreds of little red plastic stools that were used from before were stacked up to the side. The doctors and nurses had more free time so I took some more time to chat with them. So I asked the nurse, which day had the most people? The doctor said, “well that’s the 28th and 29th of the twelfth (and last) month of the [Lunar] year. It was like everyone went insane! Thousands upon thousands of people were piled up here.” And the nurse said, “That day, someone even hit me.” I asked, “Why did they hit you?” She said, “That patient was very irritated. She spent many hours in line for registration, many hours in line to get diagnosed, many hours in line to pick up medicine, then spent many hours to get an injection. So you would imagine how agitated she must have been. She insisted on being hospitalized. I said ‘For your situation, you just have to go home and take your medicine. You don’t have to be so anxious to be hospitalized. Moreover, even if you were to be admitted, I don’t have any beds. I don’t have any beds. Where would you stay?’ So then the lady hit me. I said, ‘You even have the strength to hit me, what do you mean, you need to be hospitalized?’",SOMEONE PLS TRANSLATE VIDEO of NURSE/DOCTOR IN WUHAN,2020-01-29 00:26:24,/r/Coronavirus/comments/evk6yr/someone_pls_translate_video_of_nursedoctor_in/

ffxpsnb,-0.9221,0.2577,"“Now that I recall, these past few days, the 28th, 29th, and 30th of the last month, it’s like the doctors were having a nightmare.  It was indeed a very seriously panic-stricken situation. Because many Wuhan citizens recounted, the city went on lockdown the 29th on the last day of the [Lunar] year. However, during the couple days prior, no more than 10% of people were wearing masks. Most people simply did not receive any notice. The directive to go on lockdown came without any warning signs [leading up to the event]. This thus caused panic where everyone was scrambling for masks. Everyone was swarming into the hospitals. This panic is described like…We [the doctor that is talking?] are people from Daxing’anling [in northwest Heilongjiang province]. Us people from Daxing’anling, we are most afraid of forest fires. When the fire gets going, it causes hot air to rise upwards. The surrounding cold air will move in to replace [the hot air] and it forms a cyclone. So the greater the fire, the greater the wind. The greater the wind, the greater the fire. This panic-stricken state and the epidemic situation has the same [cause and effect] relationship. Panic caused all these people to crowd in one corridor to see the doctor to be diagnosed, which easily causes cross-contamination. But what even caused the panic? Apparently, the first signs of the disease was discovered at the end of December to beginning of January. Then on January 23, the city suddenly went on lockdown. You [the government] frightened people. People couldn’t even find any masks to buy.” And then I asked this doctor, “Do you lack supplies right now? Everyone is saying they are locking supplies”. The doctor said, “Lacking for sure”.  I said, “I see that the protection suit you are wearing today is a different brand from the one you were wearing yesterday.” The doctor replies, “That’s right. Day by day, the protection suit gets worse and worse. Each day, it is thinner than the [one from the] previous [day]. Like the one I have today, easily torn with your hands. Can’t use even use it. You know?” I said, “Well the situation is this. Many friends from other cities and even friends from other countries want to donate supplies but they don’t know which channels to use. Do you know of the pertinent party at the hospital and their contact info? I would like it.” He said, I do have it, but he left his cellphone in the changing room. I said, “no problem, I’ll just leave you my contact info.” So I left my contact info with that doctor. I hope he will contact me today. I will hurry and tell my friend from out of town to deliver the supplies.Speaking of supply donations, I have a bone to pick. When I first arrived at Wuhan and first started making these videos, I definitely caused somewhat of a response. As a matter of fact, some local online friends from Wuhan who were already following my videos were very enthusiastic about coming to see me. When they saw me, they pulled down their mask, “Ah Qiushi, how are you?” Qiushi with nervous look “hi” Then they said “Us Wuhan, we have a port city culture (?) we are brotherly [always ready to help our friends]. You are a brotherly person like us, we like you.” So they created and invited people to three huge WeChat Groups. One group would have 500 to over a thousand people. And the locals were in the group. I said, that’s awesome I have this group. I can ask them for local knowledge and it’ll make it easy for me to interview people. But as soon as the chat group was created, people started arguing in the group and swearing at each other. Some people said, “I don’t think it was necessary to lockdown the city. I don’t think it’s that serious.” Isn’t that some nonsense? Some people said “No, other countries even reported, 90,000 have already died.” “Don’t listen to that rubbish. If it were really 90,000 dead then the whole neighborhood would be dead. How would people not notice?” And then some people were saying, “I’ll tell you why. It’s because they want to tear down that Huanan Seafood Market. But the owner has too much clout, no one could get it torn down. So they took the animal they were studying in that P4 [BSL-4] lab and brought it to the market to create a small disaster, which would close down the market. But then they couldn’t control it.” “Who did you hear that from? Don’t say such nonsense, you stupid cunt.” “You’re a stupid cunt” “You’re a stinking stupid cunt.” So they just kept on cursing. I said “please please, can we please not argue? I just want to ask one thing. In your homes, are you in short supply of masks?” Everyone said “yes yes yes, definitely lack [masks]”. And everyone all started to reply below and all said they lacked masks. Because on the 23rd when there was an announcement to lockdown the city, many people did not see any warning signs [leading up to the event]. So they rushed out to scramble for masks. But they weren’t able to get any. After that it was the holidays. Right now, many drugstores are not even open so you aren’t able to buy masks. So a lot of people said “It’s not because I don’t want to go outside. I don’t have any masks at home so I’m afraid to go out. I only have three masks left. Who knows how long the lockdown will last? So nope, not going outside. Not enough masks.” I said, “Okay, this is what I suggest. There are hundreds of people in this chat group. There’s a lot of supplies that need to be brought in. There are many friends from outside the city who want to donate supplies but don’t want to go through the Red Cross because in the past couple of years the Red Cross committed some perverted scandalous acts. They ruined their reputation. So they want to directly donate to the people of Wuhan. So amongst the hundreds of you, could you select a representative who can be the main contact, give me an address, and can be responsible for receiving the shipment? I’m staying at a small hotel. You're not expecting me to let a truck to come to the small hotel, right?” Two days pass. Up until now, in this chat, they still haven’t selected a contact person who can be responsible for receiving the goods. I said, “Why? Why don’t y’all want to send someone to receive these supplies, these donations?” Then someone attacked me and said “Why do we have to go send some to receive the supplies? Why can’t they send planes to air drop them?” Wow, Wuhan isn’t like an earthquake disaster zone or anything, you're expecting an airdrop? Then everyone started seriously discussing the topic of air dropping. “Ah, I think if they were to air drop, they should do it on the outskirts, not inside the city or else they would destroy buildings."" ""I think they should air drop it in the open space of a sports stadium, otherwise the air drop would hang from building and it wouldn’t be easy to retrieve them”  Is it because you played too much PUBG? Hundreds of people were complaining and saying they don’t have enough masks at home, I need masks. But once you ask them to send someone to coordinate and organize receiving the goods, they wouldn't even select one person. This is the Chinese society of today. Totally atomic (?) like a sheet of loose sand [in a state of disunity].  The Chinese government especially hate it when the people form organizations and organize together to form movements. So they regulate non government organizations to go as far as to strike them down. They are very strict. But of course, the non government organizations also conducted many senseless and shameless acts. So now, when facing a disaster, the people simply cannot effectively organize, take action, or mobilize. I now finally understand, why [even though] the Wenchuan earthquake was obviously less severe in magnitude compared to the 3/11 earthquake [in Japan] but the casualties were so [much more] severe. After the disaster took place, the people were not able to form an effective and strong rescue effort. So yeah, this is the situation.",SOMEONE PLS TRANSLATE VIDEO of NURSE/DOCTOR IN WUHAN,2020-01-29 00:26:24,/r/Coronavirus/comments/evk6yr/someone_pls_translate_video_of_nursedoctor_in/

ffxpthy,-0.9687,0.2577,"So now about the donation of goods, I have a friend called Yajun Wang. His nickname is ""crooked mouth Wang"". He is a news commentator who writes biting criticism and many dislike him. He acted very quickly. On the 30th of Last month, he quickly got in contact with some manufacturers where he knew the owners and was able to raise [donations for] 4000 boxes of protective glasses, protective gowns, and disinfectant. These things just happen to be much needed consumables. So he loaded the truck and sent the shipment to its way here. Right when he carried this out, he received a call from the concerning department who said can you not write any more articles attacking what’s going on in Wuhan? Do you want to spend the New Year in jail? So then he said he was bitterly disappointed and doesn't even feel like caring about this issue anymore. So I know his supplies will arrive at a hospital in Huanggang city because he got the information that while Wuhan’s resources are relative lacking, it’s much better than before. The prefecture level and county level cities near Wuhan have more of a shortage of supplies so they prioritized helping these places. I really want to go take videos of the journey of the arrival of these goods but I cannot leave the city. I can't be expected to ride a bicycle to Huanggang, right? So that’s the situation. So, I feel really helpless. Right now, I’m hoping for two things. One is that the pertinent party from the hospital will contact me. And the other is, I received news that the Japanese embassy called for an evacuation. If they are really going to evacuate, I want to go film it. Why are they evacuating already?

It not apples to apples but more bananas to plantains. They look similar and can be very easy to assume to be the same, but the inside and nitty gritty of them are very different. Corona Virus and the flu both are respiratory and have similar early symptoms (however we are still learning all the exact symptoms of n-CoV 2019). But when you dig deeper to what the virus does and the history of both virus then you learn you cant compare them. They spread differently, kill differently, have different medication and treatments, different incubation periods, and most significantly have different cultural looks. Unfortunately the flu is excepted as the norm and is not taken as serious as it should while n-CoV 2019 is currently being treated with a bit of panic. Just this single season, 13 million cases of the flu have been reported with 120,000 hospitalization and 6,600 deaths. This happens yearly with varying severity, in 2017-18 season 79,400 deaths were reported with 959,000  hospitalizations.  This is not to say n-CoV 2019 is worse or better than the flu because its different, we cannot compare the two because they are fundamentally different.

And about 30% of all infected, develop the severe form.As you said, the overall mortality is probably a lot lower than you can even calculate from numbers given in the public domain, because we don't really know how many were or are infected with minimal or no symptoms. Later on, with population studies doing immunologic studies, that overall mortality may turn out to be very low.Overall interpretation  (and this is my opinion and i'm a physician, but remember nobody is an expert, because nobody knows anything about this virus! ):The main problem with the virus is that being a new virus, nobody in the whole planet is immune to it. The other problem is that it's spreading fast (high transmissibility). The number of 2019-CoV virus infections since the beginning of this epidemic already exceed the number of people that got SARS in all its history.Being new virus, also, we don't know the natural history of the disease. We really don't even know the true incubation period (it's taken to be around 14 days) and we don't know if patients remain infectious even after they're clinically ""healed"" (as is the case of ebola: semen of a healed man can transmit the disease for months).So my overall understanding is that the authorities are being cautious in protecting populations from a large epidemic of a new virus that may kill a lot of people and at least temporarily incapacitate (or isolate) others.Because even if it's 2% lethal, and it infects 60 million (and that's only a small fraction of the world population), it means it kills 1.3 million people....and the attempts to contain it paralyzes the economy. Even without being infected, it has paralyzed multi-million population cities in China and the economy that depends on them.

Once they are tapped out, the fatality rate will climb.  During H1N1, we only had so many ECMO machines.  The save rate on the machines was good but there was so little availability of the technology.  It takes time to recover and that time spent means other people going without.  I would like to see figures on the initial 1000 people diagnosed.  See how many of those died, recovered, or are still fighting the disease in bad condition.  I suspect we already have that answer.  If less then 100 have recovered, 130 have died, then the condition of the 780 or so is what I want to know.  Are most on the road to recovery, or fighting for their lives.

Only a small amount of Chinese people eat different kinds of animals, we do not eat whatever wild animal it finds around. I am not for the Chinese regime, as a child to my parents who migrated from China to Europe years ago because of the regime I find it very hard to not be upset at these kinds of posts. All my life i've been visiting family in China, living there for periods of time and I can confirm that most Chinese people are very polite, hygienic and do most definitely not eat wild animals that they can find. ''We cannot rely on a country that eats whatever wild animal it finds around'' is such a disturbing statement, you group and entire population of people who cannot do anything about the Chinese regime as disgusting people. Again i'm not saying I don't agree with all the other things you've said in your post, but please do understand that it's upsetting to see people that you love and care for be treated so harshly based on stereotype. I live in the Netherlands right now, i've been treated as if i'm disgusting before because they think I eat wild animals.  The feeling sucks, it's hurtful and upsetting. I'm sorry if my english is not that good in my text, it's not my native language.Edit:What i'm trying to say that putting a population of more than 1 bil people inside a group that eats unsanitary weird animals etc is wrong. It affects many asian people on a daily basis (not only Chinese people, Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese etc are often also affected by these stereotypes), asians are often talked to as if they are disgusting or weird because of  food stereotypes many people think about us.","China will continue to be a hotbed for new illnesses, shut itself down, and destabilize the global economy.",2020-01-29 07:42:38,/r/Coronavirus/comments/evoioe/china_will_continue_to_be_a_hotbed_for_new/

Segregating 1.4 billion workforce just so you can get a piece of mind that your products are tainted by the hands of the chinese people is perhaps the most idiotic thing to say. Have you at least got some basic economics education about comparative advantage, specialization of labor, etc. well. Theories aside. Let’s look at what you’ve said:You claim that one man out of the 1.4 billion spit on a doctor’s face because if he shall die, he wish to drag one more person down. Interestingly, in the subreddit called public freak out, I see that shit happening everywhere in the world, all the time, especially in the place I’m residing right now - ‘murica. So no, the mentality that when you’re in deep shit you wanna get some vengeance is not uniquely chinese. Next, let’s examine this attitude of “let’s shut them out from the world because one of them fucked up big time”. Similar thing can be said towards the Muslim community because they read the qu’ran and some terrorists emerged out from following Islamic traditions. So you agree you wanna purge another billion people in the world just because a few rotten apples? What about the huge Muslim community in Indonesia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nigeria, Morocco? Or the black community in the states because some were perpetual criminals? The point being: what you’re preaching is a fucked up idea and a slippery slope that if we start to segregate people by a few traits or behaviors and if start to generalize their entire community, then you’re the reason why the world used to be fucked up and you’re the obstacle between a truly globalized, immersed, progressive world. Plenty of international organizations have pointed ™ out that the future of humanity is one where the concept of nations are no longer relevant, where everyone is a global citizen. That’s gonna help in solving poverty, ILLNESS, inequality and countless more issues that PLAGUES our world right now. Sure, this may seem a bit far stretched especially given how divided and war torn our world is right now. But any progress is a progress and you surely don’t wanna take a step backwards.

I would flee as well. The issue is not an individual. Society shapes who we are and we shape society. In a global world the West took advantage of  China but now we are starting to pay the price for cheap goods as the problems in one society start to affect others. I come from a culture far from ideal and know the feeling of discrimination but I don't take it personally. Poverty makes people do desperate things and I know plenty of good and bad people from any kind. Are your friends of higher social status? You weren't even born in China, my Chinese friends there have told me they are happy to not live there after visiting. It is by constructive criticism that we can fix our society not by personal offence. The west is also at fault for encouraging China to manufacture everything and squeeze the regulations out. Stereotypes hurt, I agree from experience but we need to be able to see some are there for a reason and some are a myth.

fg4bgx5,0.9762,0.0,"**Friends and family not taking things seriously?**\~5 minute read:So,  a day or two ago I saw a post in one of the designated subreddits about  how OP’s loved ones weren’t taking things seriously and laughing at  them for being worried and wanting to be prepared. (Cant find it at the  moment)A lot of users chimed in  confirming they were in a similar situation.  Immediately I    connected  the dots and concluded that the “Facebook crowd”  was unusually not  discussing this at the least! They lack peripheral vision when it comes  to world events and have thus made the whole of Facebook a circle-jerk  of people laughing out anyone brave enough to suggest that it’s better  to be ridiculed for being prepared and not need the provisions than to  later be ridiculed for not taking action should mass hysteria and human  nature kick in.Now, me and my  family live in one of the safest places in the world to be during such  an occasion, on an island in the Baltic sea, but JUST IN CASE SH1T HITS  THE FAN me and my S/O have been making trips to the stores, and little  by little gathering canned and dry goods, medical previsions, food for  our pets and some cleaning and hygiene supplies. In just three days  we’ve built up a stockpile that should last the three people living in  the house, two cats, a large dog and 20 fish in the aquarium for at  least 2 months.Including a tank  full of gas, this all cost us just around 400€. That’s for 3 people and a  tiny zoo for 2 months. And in no way is this wasted money! IF it turns  out the sky isn’t falling and the apocalypse gets canceled this time  around (as it has been so many times before!) will we not be able to  make use of the food? Will the gas in our car get rancid in 2 months?  Will the pets suddenly not require feeding? NO! These things will come  in handy even if everything turns out to be OK!The  first two days were quite calm, business as usual... nobody was buying  canned goods, nobody was buying bottled water but today we got our first  national scare, as two (TOTALLY HEALTHY) Chinese tourists in our  capital were forced to go to the ER. At 1:30pm the local supermarket  parking lots were full, all but two carts were in use and most of the  cheaper canned goods were almost out of stock. Staff members were  stocking rows of 5  liter water bottles in isles and everyone seemed on  edge. A LOT of  local men work overseas in an already infected region  and most of them visit home on weekends...Now,  all this being said, the statistics of this outbreak are still too  fresh to make any  serious conclusions, in any case it would seem that  for a previously healthy young(ish) person the likelihood of dying from  nCoV2019 if infected is relatively low. But a lot of rumors and  fearmongering is going on, people are starting to panic. And IF the  statistics start showing exponential infection rates outside of China,  mass hysteria and public unrest will follow! In conclusion, I am more  concerned about the public reaction to nCoV2019 than the virus itself.In  light of all this I’ve created a Facebook page where I try and keep the  common folk objectively updated on the situation and educate them on  best practices to be ready to deal with this situation. The page is a  work in progress and as I have nothing better to do, I’ll be working on  it like a full time position.I  collect data from different groups and trusted news sources all over the  internet, from Reddit and from global and national organizations and  always link my sources. I avoid political and religious discussion and  will not tolerate polarization or xenophobia in the comments.**I   wholeheartedly hope this post/comment will not be deleted as my goal  isn’t to steal anyone's thunder and in no way will I be profiting from  this effort. My goal is to spread awareness and help people understand  this situation for what it is and clear up the panic that has started to  rear its ugly head among people who might not even know what Reddit is.**Feel  free to join and invite your friends and family as well. There is  absolutely no need for   panic as that would only complicate the global  efforts to contain this outbreak.Don’t be scared, be prepared! :)[http://facebook.com/ReasonablyPrepared](http://facebook.com/ReasonablyPrepared)TL/DR:1. People on Facebook being laughed at for showing concern.2. People seem unaware of the possible repercussions of nCoV2019 and the societal unrest that would ensue.3. I Made a FB page to distill objective info gathered from here, global organizations and other sources.4. Trying to provide information on best practices on self-quarantine and preparedness without being alarmist about it.5.

Below are some websites I found that helped me decide what to buy and how to get my family prepared for the Worst Case Scenario, but I also wanted to touch on the OP: Masks- are best used when in close quarters with infected, wearing them outside would be a prophylactic measure, but isn’t 100% effective. The best masks to get would be an N95 mask (linked below). I opted for some of these for my family of 4, and also 2 sets of cloth masks that are washable.Gloves- these are crucial to your survival. I have disposable gloves stocked up for emergencies. If we had an epidemic in the US, I would put these on, and remove them upon re-entering my home/car and dispose of them. Hygiene Practices- are the most important step. Wash your hands often, with hot soapy water for 30 seconds. Keep hand sanitizer in your bag, and at the door of your home. DON’T TOUCH YOUR FACE!!!! Hibiclens is disinfecting soap that surgeons use when they “scrub-in” to surgery, and is the strongest soap you can buy. This is good to have if you need to disinfect quickly or are exposed to someone you think may be infected. Lysol is stationed at every door in my home, and I spray all doorknobs daily (I’m a germaphobe if you couldn’t tell-funny because I’m a microbiologist). Panic- is the biggest threat to our society. Don’t panic, treat others with respect and dignity. Don’t hoard supplies you don’t need, that are necessary for others.Protection- if you and your family are pro-gun, by all means make sure you have ammo stocked. If you aren’t, make sure you can protect yourselves in some way.Water:[Water Ration and Storage ](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/hydration-for-the-apocalypse-how-to-store-water-for-long-term-emergencies/) [Purifying Water at Home ](http://survivaltopics.com/better-than-bleach-use-calcium-hypochlorite-to-disinfect-water/) Food:[Prep Pantry 101](https://www.moneytalksnews.com/14-easy-ways-create-emergency-food-stockpile/) [In Depth Pantry Prep](http://nwedible.com/preparedness-101-how-to-build-two-week-emergency-pantry/) Overall Emergency:[Bug-out or Bug-in](https://theprepared.com/prepping-basics/guides/emergency-preparedness-checklist-prepping-beginners/) Stay safe friends, and let’s pray for the people of China in this terrifying time, it could have just as easily happened to us.",Preparedness sticky,2020-01-29 07:48:56,/r/Coronavirus/comments/evolnz/preparedness_sticky/

It defiantly does not help that China is obsessed with its global image, has poor health care systems in remote regions, and has a large population. This makes the health organizations job that much harder because on one hand its primary goal is health and safety (which includes prevents the spread of misinformation by only reporting verified and accurate information which may take months to be able to state without a doubt, maintaining a level of trust with statistics, and preventing a panic) on the other hand its a public organization that governments and their constituents demand information on scary disease (meaning when they don't report an issue in its entirety, maybe because they haven't verified it or to prevent a panic when none is need because we all know how media loves the catchy disease to end the world head line, everyone loses trust). You are correct that this isn't a seasonal flu, but are vastly mis-comparing Spanish flu. Even if n-CoV 2019 is worse than the Spanish flu (again its brand new, we still don't know how contagious, deadly, or sever it is), the Spanish Flu was brought during a time of major economic depression and spread because lack of vaccine science, proper medical infrastructure in undeveloped countries (such as central/south America, Asia, and European countries devastated by major wars). The reason n-CoV 2019 is looking so serious is because its grabs catch headlines (similar to Ebola). So far its fatality rate is 1/40 (ish) and even if you don't trust the fatality rates from China, the actual people who have died have been people with weak immune systems (elderly, malnourished, unhygienic, and the young). Even if you don't trust all of that, the employees at the WHO and all the heads of government can get sick just like you and I so it is in everyone interest not to have disease spreading. Trust your public health organization or at least the international health organization or else the deadliest thing that will be spreading is fear and panic. Is this something that we need to keep an eye on, yes. Should I begin digging my bunker, no not yet. Unless you hear the WHO or CDC/your respective health control agency report facts on the virus, don't listen to flashy news headlines or random posts on the internet.

ffyh4nt,-0.8993,-0.3818,"Regarding the US, if we end up seeing an explosion in cases similar to China due to the significant infection rate and death rate of this virus, structural issues in Americas healthcare system, caused by government intervention, is going to cause significant problems and really tax our system. Our government has artificially restricted the supply of medical workers to keep wages for currently licensed medical professionals artificially high over the decades. The American Medical Association has fought a long battle to artificially restrict the amount of medical personnel out of greed for their own wages, as increasing the supply of labor enough in any field drives down wages. The same doctors who use ""free market"" arguments to justify refusing public healthcare funding have no issue with government intervention in the free market to eliminate threats to their inflated salaries. Their actions, out of greed, will kill people if this gets as bad as it could theoretically do so.Sources:https://fee.org/articles/the-medical-cartel-is-keeping-health-care-costs-high/Excerpt from article""A Choreographed Shortage of CareThough few Americans realize it, health care is a monopoly. In the early 20th century, the American Medical Association (AMA) lobbied the Federal government to close all schools not approved by its own Council on Medical Education. They unfortunately succeeded and 30 percent of medical schools were closed within 30 years. The number of doctors has been artificially capped ever since.The AMA also controls state boards of licensing, limiting the number of physicians in each state and preventing competitors from treating patients. The United States has 50 percent fewer practicing physicians per capitathan Sweden or Germany. Unsurprisingly, US doctors also work fewer hours while earning much higher salaries.Even as the US population and its demand for medical services continue to expand dramatically, the number of new doctors educated by “approved” schools and licensed by state boards hasn’t improved. In fact, two-thirds of highly qualified medical school applicants are turned away each year.  Licensing quotas and arbitrary caps set by state boards literally make it illegal to train a single additional candidate in the medical field. Inevitably, where there is a shortage, prices rise for everyone. This results in smaller and poorer markets being shut out altogether. Even if the additional physicians were “B list” doctors from sub par medical schools, smaller towns like Collegedale would still be better off with a “B-” doctor than no doctor at all.Though few Americans realize it, health care is a monopoly.Cartels Protecting Doctors Both directly or indirectly, the AMA also controls the prices paid to physicians, the licensing of physicians, the accreditation of medical schools, admittance into medical schools, and the payment policies of insurance companies. The AMA runs on membership fees, and its mission is protecting the interests of current doctors, not the American public.Fewer doctors mean higher salaries, less competition, and more negotiating power for physicians. This is allowed to happen because physicians, like any other group of citizens, are free to associate and express their interests through donations.What should outrage all US patients is the collusion of our government under the guise of protecting the public interest by requiring licenses and letting a cartel of campaign donors say who can have one.Not only can the cartel set prices but the taxpayer is also forced to fund the muscle to shut down and jail those caught trying to circumvent the government-protected monopoly.""https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/thanks-to-doctors-there-arent-enough-doctors?_amp=true",This is not just a seasonal flu,2020-01-29 10:25:54,/r/Coronavirus/comments/evqt2o/this_is_not_just_a_seasonal_flu/

fjclcss,0.8747,0.5574,"I'm afraid that's one of the biggest misconceptions. We're actually herbivores. We became omnivores as a method of survival when we moved into the northern hemisphere where there was a shortage of food. But biologically we are definitely not supposed to be eating meat.The canine thing is a common misunderstanding. Lots of of herbivores have canine teeth much larger and sharper than ours and they're still not carnivores.Carnivores tend to have razor sharp teeth for ripping into flesh. They also have fixed jaws with no sideways movement so they can latch & clamp on on to large chunks of flesh. Any sideways movement and they'd dislocate their jaws.Our teeth are typical of herbivorous animals. Primarily flat grinding teeth with an unfixed jaw that allows sideways chewing. Perfect for chewing and grinding down fibrous plant matter. Our teeth, nails and jaws would simply break if we tried to take down an animal with them.I'd also point to all the diseases that are linked to meat consumption - like heart diseases, bowel & stomach cancers, diabetes etc..There are so many biological reasons as to why we're not omnivores. I think the documentary 'Game Changers' may explain more if I remember correctly.

Second, otters use rocks to open up oysters to eat their meat, does that suddenly not make them meat eaters? Third, you pointed out how some herbivores have sharper teeth than us and others typically have flat teeth, we don’t have either of those, since we aren’t carnivores or herbivores, why do we have canines? And the reason we have flat and sharp teeth is because we are OMNIVOROUS. We have teeth for eating both meat and plants, So you just further proved my point.Fourth if you’re going to say we have similar stomachs to a cow’s, which are herbivores, looks can be deceiving, they look the same but they don’t have the same enzymes.Fifth, meat being linked to diseases is like saying vaccines are linked to autism, there is little to no evidence of that.

It opened Sunday to a huge crowd, each day was slower, and today it was nearly empty of buyers. This is not the normal pattern at that show. The buyers would have bought non- refundable plane tickets weeks ago, it looks like many of them decided to stay home anyway.  These would mostly be buyers from the United States, and most of the exhibitors are American, even if the products are made overseas.  The buyers would be store owners, and buyers for large corporate chains. The corporate buyers represent a lot of buying power, but the largest number of buyers are store owners.

ffzalk3,-0.6674,0.0,"The answer is no. Let me try to break this down as easily as possible. Forgive me if this seems longwinded Scientists now believe the virus went undocumented in China mid December of 2019, back then the media claimed it was a mystery illness. I remember this because the CNN app kept notifying me on my phone about a mystery illness. By mid January 2020 the “mystery illness” was identified as a form of coronavirus. During this short period of time cases probably went undocumented and proper testing was not in place. And with Chinese New Year approaching, I’m sure the Chinese government also downplayed the severity of the outbreak in order to save face. This allowed for the virus to spread unchecked. OK! Here’s the real answer to your question:Wuhan has a population of 11million people, it’s of a tourist hub, not to mention a local Chinese travel hub for work. People are constantly in contact with one another for work and tourism. Given the fact that the virus is transmitted through human contact and is somewhat airborne populated cities like Wuhan, Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong are breeding grounds for a coronavirus. Which is also why the Chinese government is so concerned about protecting their most densely populated cities. With all that being said, the unfortunate timing of Chinese New Years did not help with containing the virus to only Wuhan or the Hubei province. Chinese New Year is the largest annual human migration on earth. People from different provinces in China and different countries travel all parts of China to visit family, some could have stopped in Wuhan to get to their final destination. The reason why there are fewer cases and fewer deaths outside of China is because countries outside of China had a larger window, not by much, to monitor and screen for people suspected of infection. Everyone else had time to prepare. It’s a combination of a viral outbreak with a strange incubation period in a very densely populated city with a booming tourist economy with insufficient medical resources.  This could have happened in any densely populated city. For example, H5N1 aka Avian Flu devastated parts of Asia and South East Asia, but Egypt had the most cases/deaths.",Coronavirus mostly affecting Chinese/Asians?,2020-01-29 22:28:36,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ew135a/coronavirus_mostly_affecting_chineseasians/
