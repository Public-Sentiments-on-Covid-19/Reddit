fg1q3or,-0.9708,-0.4019,"To people saying the death rate is likely higher than 2% - I think it's too early to be making that call. There are several reasons why the mortality rate may be lower infact; due to a shortage of testing kits only the most severe cases are likely being tested, not everyone with mild disease symptoms will be reporting illness, there are cases where patients are asymptomatic (see the 10 yr old boy who was shedding viral particles and presented with fluid in lungs but no outward symptoms for example. Or the two human to huma transmissions in Germany and the US).   I'm not claiming some of these facts aren't worrying by the way!  Of course the death rate may also be higher as well due to reasons mentioned in this thread, misinformation from the authorities in China etc etc.   While OP has a very succinct analysis of what COULD happen, they themselves point that this is one of many scenarios. I'm not quite convinced this amount of speculation is helpful, but I definitely agree that keeping ourselves informed of current events is important.

I didnt realize it was restricted!""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported the first case of person-to-person transmission of coronavirus in the United States. In a telebriefing on Thursday, officials said the patient is the husband of a Chicago woman who was diagnosed with the illness after returning from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus.Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC director, said the health agency had expected to identify ""some"" person-to-person spread in the U.S., and insisted that the risk to the American public ""remains low."" Officials stressed that the husband, who is in his 60s and has underlying health issues, and his wife had continued close contact while she was symptomatic, exposing him to the virus.Both patients remain hospitalized and the man is stable. The woman, who is also in her 60s and was the first travel-related case confirmed in Illinois, is said to be ""doing well.""Officials said an investigative team is continuing to look into potential contacts of the couple.Health officials in Canada previously reported a similar instance in a couple who were diagnosed with the coronavirus after they returned from a trip to Wuhan. The Ontario Ministry of Health said the man, who is in his 50s, reported fever and respiratory symptoms and was placed in isolation. Days later, the wife also tested positive for the virus.At this time, the CDC said it does not recommend the general public wear masks, but that those who have recently traveled to China be vigilant about reporting possible symptoms.The virus, which originated in Wuhan, has sickened more than 7,700 people and has been linked to at least 170 deaths. The number of cases in mainland China has now surpassed that of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, but the death toll remains significantly lower.This is a developing story.""",Person to Person transmission reported in US,2020-01-30 10:45:45,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewa5i6/person_to_person_transmission_reported_in_us/

Seems a bit extreme? If not, then it must be quite serious right?  Yet the WHO continues to praise that move, and during the last conference when they announced an international state of emergency ,couldn't stress enough how great china handled the situation from the start.* Multiple countries close their borders and lock down transport to and from china. And not just the neighboring countries.* WHO declared the global state of emergency. So it must be serious right?* Stock markets are starting to fluctuate* Official reports in a lot of countries saying tourism agencies,  travel, residence and holiday bookings are drastically going down, in some cases even from 70-100%  down till april (singapore)So yeah, i do agree, some fake news are spreading, and some conspiracy theories are showing up.But looking at real official news and coming to a conclusion something is really wrong is as easy as 1+1=2.Imo, most of the world citizens shouldn't panic at all, but at this point should absolutely take precautions, and prepare them selves and their family with some extra supplies and medicine.",Fake news needs to end,2020-01-30 13:23:13,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewck3v/fake_news_needs_to_end/

fg1b9n1,-0.9957,-0.3818,"The biggest concern with this is the extremely high and fast spreading rate this virus is causing. I'm not exactly sure why people keep looking at death number but death number isn't the only problem when it comes to virus. There are other factors.For one, you have to see the infection rate that leads to a severe case. Influenza, for an example, had a spread rate of up to 1-2 people. This virus has a spread rate of up to 5+ people. That's a **very** high number of spreading rate and mean it can travel extremely fast if an outbreak were to occur. Now you're going to say, who cares? we probably won't die and just have cold symptoms. Wrong. If the infection rate were to spread that fast, that means a high number of treatment will be needed at the same time. The reason why the case in China is so serious is because of so many people getting infected extremely fast. The infection rate in China is currently multiplying by x4. It was at 2000 yesterday and now it jumped up to 8000 today. With this many amount of people being infected in such a short amount of time says something. First, when you get infected, you start developing symptoms. When you develop symptoms such as high fever, you need treatment. When you need treatment, you go to a hospital. If you don't receive treatment, your case has a very high chance of becoming severe and that's when this virus becomes **deadly**. Severe case with this virus can cause pneumonia, organ fail, stroke, and death. Nobody wants a virus to become severe. So now imagine up to 8,000 people being infected in one city and the number multiplying by double in just 24 hours. How many people do you think a hospital can hold? The biggest problem is, they will have to continuously take in new patients while simultaneously treat the ones already in. This is the biggest problem in China right now as every hospital are jammed packed and people can't even get treated. It's so bad that emergency call in China doesn't even work. People with problems that isn't related to the virus can't even see a doctor. This is the type of problem that can happen if an outbreak were to occur in other countries. It isn't about the death rate. It's really about containing outbreak and avoiding stuff like this.","WHO declares China virus outbreak an international emergency - Reuters - Jan. 30, 2020",2020-01-30 13:32:22,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewcp7f/who_declares_china_virus_outbreak_an/

One of China's top virology and immunology experts was and still **works at China's top-rated biohazard lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which some have affectionately called** [**the real Umbrella Corp**](https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/real-umbrella-corp-wuhan-ultra-biohazard-lab-was-studying-worlds-most-dangerous-pathogens)**.**2. Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world.3. His primary field of study is researching **how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick.**4. He was genetically engineering various immune pathways ([such as the STING pathway in bats](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323347216_Dampened_STING-Dependent_Interferon_Activation_in_Bats)) to make the bats more or less susceptible to infection, **in the process potentially creating a highly resistant mutant superbug.**5. As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; **these are ""superbug"" Coronavirus strains, which are not resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild.**6. As of mid-November, his lab was actively hiring inexperienced post-docs to help conduct his research into super-Coronaviruses and bat infections.7. Peng's work on virology and bat immunology **has received support from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology.**Edit: At this point its just a theory that seems interesting, and has some nice documentation and ""timing"" that kinda fits with the theory.

There is a significant amount of ACE2 in every single human being due to the fact that it plays an important role in the RAAS pathway (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone).

fg2u57r,-0.906,-0.8176,"These don't entirely matter much. We know the amount of infected is likely in the tens of thousands in Hubei, and likely thousands outside in the rest of China from those who left Hubei during the lunar new year. Even China has said the amount of confirmed infections is mostly those who had specifically come to the hospital to be checked, often very sick people. Guangdong's hospitals claimed that over 95% of the infected they have are people who came from Hubei, not just new transmissions, which indicates that the new reported infections aren't actually new infections, just them catching up to the already-infected. All this is is them testing a few thousand people a day out of likely 100,000 cases which need to be tested. Its why the figure has risen so linearly, because that is how many tests they can do a day. The influx of thousands of chinese medical staff on the 25th resulted in the amount of confirmed infections rising dramatically simply because they had more people to test more people. Its literally possible this virus is declining, but the confirmed infections will still rise and rise for days. We have no idea.
