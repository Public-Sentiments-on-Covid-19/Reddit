fg30h2c,0.4336,0.0,Seemed fishy to me too. My impression is that China was being difficult with sharing info with the WHO so now theyre kissing ass for better access.

Social chaos can cause more damage then the virus itself, so while they need to send a strong alert message they should be careful to not make things worse by creating public panic. Second it is absolutely true China is way more powerful and prepared to deal with this situation then other countries, and I mean other developed countries...

fg3whuy,0.8793,0.0,"I think hardly anyone doubts that the number of real infected people is significantly larger than the number of confirmed cases. It may be interesting to speculate how many times higher the number of cases really is compared to the confirmed cases, but ultimately, this probably does not change that much.First, what is most threatening about 19-nCov is not so much the absolute number at the current time, but the pattern with a fast exponential increase. This is the case no matter with what number we have to multiply the number of confirmed cases in order to get the number of real cases.Second, if the real number of infections is much higher, this on one hand may show that this 19-nCov is more contagious than previously thought, but on the other hand, it would probably point towards lower mortality than otherwise. Probably, there is a bias towards people with stronger symptoms to be more likely to be tested, anyway, but if the real number of infections is much larger than the number of confirmed cases, this makes it more likely that this effect is even stronger.","China Virus Cases May Be Undercounted Even With 3,000% Surge",2020-01-31 03:19:06,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewn0v8/china_virus_cases_may_be_undercounted_even_with/

Currently we are finding over 1000 new confirmed cases per day. A significant percentage of the confirmed cases have come in within the last 10 days and there is a variable window for lethal escalation or further complication. As the virus continues to spread and new cases are confirmed, infrastructure in areas with high incidence of infection will be increasingly stressed. With over 1000 current cases rated as severe to critical in Hubei province alone, the new hospital with a planned bed count of 1000-1500 beds will essentially be full as soon as it opens.Keep in mind that the existing cases classified as severe to critical are only counts of those that are actually currently hospitalized. There have been numerous reports on the ground of patients that were recommended for in-patient care but not able to actually be admitted due to lack of bed space. That means the actual rate of severe to critical cases is as least somewhat understated.Regardless, as it has been said over and over, we can only work with the data we have available at the time and until this is over, we will not have a true idea of the direct mortality rate, and we may never know the number of lives that will be lost indirectly due to limited access to medical attention for injuries or completely different diseases and pre-existing conditions, starvation, or any other side effect of the stress put on infrastructure and supply chains.","""Mortality rate is 11%-15%"" from: Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study",2020-01-31 04:51:37,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewo19j/mortality_rate_is_1115_from_epidemiological_and/

These were split amongst the hospitals in the province and they are using questionable screening protocols in an attempt to prequalify patients so as not to waste the test kits on hand.

It even has ""2019"" in its name.* Even for china, nobody in their right mind would lock down 60.000.000 people because there were 1000 confirmed infected and like 100 deaths.* Just as china didn't change their ways of censorship and maintaining control over their people and information, the rest of the world didn't change their ways of trying to maintain the flow of economy at a risk of peoples health. Meaning just cause they got praised by WHO the other day they wont suddenly say ""okay these are actually the real numbers""However, even if china was honest and released real numbers there are several problems that would cause numbers to not show realistic figures:* Panic in china flooded hospitals, specially in the beginning when most people didnt even know what symptoms were caused by the virus.  Do not forget there are other illnesses and diseases, and even catching a common cold (it is flu season after all) will send people into the hospitals trying to get tested for the virus.  * China has a hard time keeping up distributing test kits, eye witness says wuhan got 10,000 test kits , for a city with over 10,000,000 people.  Further more, people are ordered to stay indoors, there is no public transportation, and the ambulance phones are all busy so people cant get to hospitals to get tested.  All this meaning people dont get tested, and cant be confirmed and reported as infected.  And on the other side, people that die of pneumonia or such are not having an autopsy ,instead are just written off as ""died of pneumonia"" and it does not contribute towards the number of death caused by the virus.* Add to the fact many people fled wuhan before they even announced the lock down ,as well as the unfortunate timing of the outbreak being the chinese new year which involves millions of people from and outside china to traveling everywhere, spreading the virus which has an incubation period of 5-14 days during which it can still spread around to other humans isnt helping anyone.The world is currently in a race between prevention/containment and everyone that is infected but is in the incubation period.

fg3xq86,-0.998,-0.128,"BEIJING —  When Gao Fei warned members of his family about the deadly virus sweeping their way, he never suspected that they would laugh at him, or that he would end up being arrested.The migrant worker had left Hubei province last year to freelance as a welder in southern China. His family members stayed in their village in Qichun county less than two hours’ drive from Wuhan, the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 210 people and infected more than 9,700.Gao sensed something dangerous was coming. He had breached China’s firewall to follow online news of the coronavirus as it emerged this month. He immediately began messaging his parents and siblings, including his brother, who drove a taxi between their village and Wuhan every day.“Stock up on food, masks, disinfectant and medicine. Wash your hands. Don’t go to Wuhan!” he told them. They laughed. No one even knew of the virus in their hometown, they said, and nobody was wearing a mask. Gao, 33, sent a pack of surgical masks to his brother anyway. He felt helpless and enraged.ADVERTISEMENTGao was arrested Wednesday after tweeting that President Xi Jinping should resign over the government’s handling of the virus. The tweet about Xi disappeared, but [another one](https://twitter.com/3yOG87uDkHPs9KH/status/1221972586898190336)he’d written earlier, as authorities announced new penalties for “spreading rumors” about the virus outbreak, remained: “Bring it on. This is a confrontation between a government that neglects life and a people who are saving themselves. Truth is our greatest weapon for our own salvation.”Gao’s predictions have come to pass as the coronavirus spans continents and leaves China’s already overburdened medical system straining under a health emergency that has steadily accelerated. The communist leadership is entangled in its greatest medical and political crises in years, even as it attempts to assure other nations that all is under control.On Thursday, the World Health Organization, which had earlier praised China’s handling of the outbreak, declared the outbreak an international “public health emergency.”￼People wearing masks pose for photos in Beijing’s Jingshan Park on Jan. 24, 2020. China canceled Lunar New Year celebrations and venues including the Forbidden City, seen in background, were closed.(Wu Hong / EPA/Shutterstock)ADVERTISEMENTResidents, medical staff and relatives of those who are ill or have died in Hubei province are demanding help. Stories of family members stricken with coronavirus symptoms who died without being diagnosed reverberate through Chinese social media, raising suspicions that the government is underreporting the number of those infected.State TV aired video Thursday of a central inspection team questioning health officials in Huanggang, a district that includes Gao’s family home and now the city with the second-most infections and deaths after Wuhan. A top official was fired after being shamed on TV for failing to give answers on how many cases the city was dealing with and how many hospital beds it could provide.But, as Gao discovered, bureaucracy and a shortage of resources are slowing China’s response and increasing the risk of contagion. Even doctors, many of whom have no access to test kits to determine whether they have the virus or not, are falling ill with fevers and other symptoms as they treat patients. One doctor in Wuhan called China’s emergency hotline for ambulances to pick up urgent cases only to be told that 700 people were on a waiting list.It wasn’t until Zhong Nanshan, an 83-year-old doctor widely respected for having spoken truthfully during the SARS epidemic of 2003, said on TV on Jan. 20 that the virus was contagious between humans, that most Chinese people began to worry.That’s when Gao rushed home, taking a train to Hubei on Jan. 22. His grandfather and sister bought supplies while he was on the way, stockpiling enough food for two months at home. Their preparation came just in time. Wuhan was put on transportation lockdown on Jan. 23. Since then, China has quarantined at least 15 more cities that are home to more than 50 million people — more than double the populations of Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and London combined.Gao’s family village in Qichun county is enforcing its own blockade. Every morning, the village leader parks his van in the center of a road at the village entrance, blocking outsiders’ entry to limit the chances of virus exposure. But inside, villagers continue to meet in groups, especially to play mah-jongg, Gao said — many without wearing masks, unfazed because no one in their village has yet been infected.“They’re not looking at the news, just playing mah-jongg,” he said in a phone interview Wednesday. “It’s like we live in two worlds.”When he first arrived home, Gao urged government officials to distribute medical supplies and to prevent villagers from gathering for the Lunar New Year.ADVERTISEMENT“They said, ‘We don’t have orders from above,’” Gao said. Local officials refused to act without getting notice from their superiors, he said, and now, they are too overwhelmed monitoring people who’d been to Wuhan to care about potential contagion in mah-jongg groups.￼A worker moves medical waste containers past the entrance of the Wuhan Medical Treatment Center in China, where some coronavirus patients are being treated, on Jan. 22, 2020. (Associated Press )China’s bureaucratic medical system and underlings’ fear of handing party bosses bad news were significant obstacles. Officials, usually Communist Party cadres who are motivated by promotions for meeting superiors’ targets rather than accountability to the people they govern, are slow to respond to needs on the ground.Another urgent problem was the shortage of supplies. Wei Peng, a doctor in his 40s at a community hospital in Wuhan’s Qiaokou district, about two hours from Gao’s family home, said in a phone interview that at least 12 out of 59 doctors at his hospital, himself included, were working despite being sick with fevers, coughs and lung infections — symptoms of the coronavirus.“We don’t have the test kit, and we don’t have time for tests either,” Wei said.Wei suspects he became infected while treating a patient on Jan. 19, when Chinese authorities were insisting the disease, which is suspected to have started in a live animal market, was not transmissible between humans. Wei was wearing only a disposable surgical mask and no goggles when the patient coughed in his face.“As long as you’re not diagnosed, you must go to work,” said Wei. He and other doctors spend their nights at the hospital because of transportation shutdowns. “We know that we are causing risk of contagion to the patients. But if you don’t work, then what? There’s no one to replace you. Your colleagues must bear more, and they’re also infected.”The official tally of infection cases was “definitely not reliable,” Wei said. He noted: Too many patients are not being counted. There are not enough test kits. Not enough doctors. Not enough hospital beds. Not enough medicine. Not enough masks. Not enough cars to take patients to the hospital.ADVERTISEMENT“There are a lot of patients and they are anxious,” said Wei, who fashioned his own goggles out of plastic sheets. “Many are calling here and you can hear them shouting on the phone, ‘Save me, save me,’ and they are crying, and there’s nothing we can do.”￼Chinese welder Gao Fei warned family members in Hubei province of the impending coronavirus threat. When he criticized the government for its handling of the outbreak, he was arrested.( Gao Fei )In Qichun, Gao ventured out of his village Tuesday to visit the county hospital. A director there said they had 1,000 good surgical masks left, which would be gone in a matter of days. This week, the director said, armed police in Qichun were sent to a factory to confiscate any medical supplies they could find. They returned empty-handed.“All the country’s supplies are going to Wuhan, but what about us? What should we do? We wait to die?” Gao said. “Everyone is fighting for supplies, and they just try and take however much they can get. At this point, it’s a matter of survival.”Frustrated and worried, Gao [donated](https://twitter.com/3yOG87uDkHPs9KH/status/1222362654787784704) the last 10 face masks from his brother’s box to the Qichun county hospital on Wednesday. He sent out a flurry of tweets afterward, including one criticizing Xi Jinping’s arrogance in refusing help from abroad and calling for “removal of the head,” meaning the Chinese leader should resign.That’s when the police showed up.","L.A Times: Chinese migrant worker who tried to warn family about Coronavirus is laughed at, arrested by CCP.",2020-01-31 09:11:26,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewri0w/la_times_chinese_migrant_worker_who_tried_to_warn/

At one point it looked like a very real possibility that there were many many contagious, asymptomatic people coming out of China before the quarantine, and that it just wasn’t presenting itself as global issue yet due to the incubation period. Raising awareness and getting people to wash their hands more/consider wearing masks at that point would have been crucial to stopping the spread. It seemed as though organizations like the WHO were not telling people that to make the Chinese government look good and prevent panic, which wouldn’t actually do anything to stop the spread; if the virus were as contagious outside of China as it seems to be inside of China, I think this grass roots effort to pump out info and raise alertness would have been warranted.But at this point, whether it’s because the virus only effects east asians, it mutated, it was only spreading so much in China because of unsanitary conditions/festivities, whatever, it seems pretty clear it’s not spreading in the west. It’s still a bit early to know that for certain, but I’m less worried about it coming here than a couple days ago.That being said, it’s definitely a very serious issue for people in China. I’d be careful what you’re hearing from official reports from within China.

Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.

What is also concerning is that fomite transmission may be occurring as well, although not confirmed. If fomite transmission is indeed occurring that would mean that the virus could spread simply from an infectious individual depositing virus on a surface someone else touching said surface and then touching their eyes, mucus membranes or face. Consequently we as humans have a particular affinity for touching our face. There are still way to many unknowns about the virus and I don't want to speculate on how long this thing can live outside a host but we can safely assume that while not a primary  vector of infection fomite transmission is most likely occurring with short duration deposits ie virus particles deposited within 1-5 hours.

fg5a4aa,0.9921,0.0,"What the authors fail to mention is that is you BLAST the same fragments in question against the pubmed database, you also find 100% identities to some Bat coronaviruses as well. I think this is incredibly disingenuous to not include this as it is a vital piece of information.  It's most likely a coincidence that specific parts of this receptor protein shares similarities with parts of HIV-1 structural proteins, and that they instead most likely derived from the aforementioned bat coronaviruses.  I'm not saying it's impossible that there has been some sort of recombination with HIV-1. but I can't emphasis enough how incredibly unlikely this is due to the diversity between different viral families. It would be like crossing a pig with a chicken. Recombination between viruses does happen, but between different species of the same family, or strain of the same species. The simplest answer is that 2019-nCoV derives from other coronaviruses, with which it also shares a high amount of identity. Leaving natural phenomenon aside, another suggestion being discussed is the possibility that these sequences have been purposefully introduced into 2019-nCoV. This is technically possible and can be quite easy actually, and these sorts of experiments are done routinely in labs (what happens if we have include this bit of CMV with another strain of CMV? etc). These experiments are conducted with the upmost care to minimise risk in the institutions I'm familiar with (I work in a virology lab in the UK). What isn't so regular would be the introduction of viral elements from a deadly human pathogen such as HIV into viral families that are known to be transmissible in humans. Whether this happened in China I don't know, although because ethical standards are known to be less restrictive it COULD have happened. As I said, my best guess would be that the virus has evolved naturally to better infect humans (as all viruses 'strive' to do) and that the resemblance to HIV is a coincidence and there hasn't been any human manipulation. Although as I'm sure someone will point out, as a virologist I would say that!! &#x200B;Bonus fun fact. Rabies glycoprotein and some snake venoms share an incredibly high similarity (when analysed like the proteins described in this paper). This isn't because snakes have stolen rabies proteins, or rabies has had snake venom introduced into it, but because both have SEPARATELY evolved to target the same thing in human neurons. neat, huh?",An analysis of the recent paper about HIV proteins found in 2019-nCoV,2020-01-31 16:13:47,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewxne6/an_analysis_of_the_recent_paper_about_hiv/

fg66o5e,-0.9953,0.0,"Not an actual expert, but I did take a college class on epidemiology and studied these exact types of scenarios in the class. 2 to *14 days* doesn't mean anything. 14 days is the absolute upper limit, meaning they might have had one case with a 14 day incubation period and they had to report it. Except, more often than not, those types of things are fluke or misleading cases. Nearly every outbreak will have absurdly high numbers being reported in these types of situations simply because we don't have an average yet, so we can only rely on the smallest and highest cases to provide a maximum range. As time goes on, and we begin to realize (likely/hopefully) that almost all of the cases have a shorter incubation, they will likely issue a report lowering the incubation period. Again, this happens with nearly every outbreak of disease. They report that it ""kills within 1 to 20 days"" and then it turns out the guy who died in 1 day died from a heart attack. They report that ""the average person can infect anywhere from 2 to 8 people"" and then they realize the vast majority of cases are only 2, and that the 8 was a fluke figure. The majority of cases so far apparently have been much, much shorter incubation periods, typically only a few days. In the German cluster, it took less than 5 days to show symptoms for all of them. Its not like we very suddenly had 140 cases yesterday. These cases have been here for a while now, and we have seen a very low amount of transmissions globally compared to the amount of infections. We've isolated a fuck ton of cases (literally thousands of people across the infected countries) from highly suspected people and still have yet to see many real infections coming from these people, and every day that goes by where we don't see the isolated 'suspected cases' test positive gives us more hope. Seriously, worry, but don't freak out. As wild as it sounds with the confirmed cases rising day by day, the news is actually getting better day by day as these suspected cases are not coming up with many new infections. If this virus was as horrifying as originally feared, we would have unfortunately seen way, way more transmissions so far out of those 'suspected cases' which are isolated.",When people say it's contained in the US,2020-01-31 19:18:28,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewzzfb/when_people_say_its_contained_in_the_us/

Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS and SARS). 2019-nCoV is more genetically related to SARS than MERS, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. **In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures.** Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. **Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods.**","Australia has samples of the virus - why can’t they tell us how long it can live on surfaces, so people can stop worrying about or take precautions with packages from China?",2020-01-31 20:01:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ex0hht/australia_has_samples_of_the_virus_why_cant_they/

If you had 1 billion viable particles at time 0, and 1 million at 8 hours, you expect there to still be around 1 thousand left after 16 hours.For viruses like corona viruses there is a protein hull with structures on it that allows them to infect a particular type of cell. This can decay before the virus RNA decays. The viral RNA can still sometimes infect cells under peculiar circumstances even though it lacks these protein structures.Any ""can last up to 8 hours"" type statement you get is based on an arbitrary cut off point where you are statistically unlikely to get infected and it's based on an arbitrary assumption about temperature, humidity and other factors.","Australia has samples of the virus - why can’t they tell us how long it can live on surfaces, so people can stop worrying about or take precautions with packages from China?",2020-01-31 20:01:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ex0hht/australia_has_samples_of_the_virus_why_cant_they/

fg5yhz7,-0.7031,-0.5473,"They absolutely are downplaying it and will to prevent mass hysteria... you only need to look at recent history...When Ebola landed on US Soil the CDC went as far as to completely change the posters that told people what to do. And as people in the US got more worried about it the CDC put Ron Klain (who is a lawyer) as the Ebola Czar. He had no medical background and yet was the Ebola Czar.... After he was apppointed the CDC went quiet, the news went quiet. Patients being flown in with Ebola were not getting reported on until days or weeks later if at all.They changed the wording on ebola posters as the general public does not know the difference between the terms airborne and aerosolized. They kept stressing it was not airborne knowing John Q. Public would think that meant you could not get it by getting coughed on by a person infected with Ebola.They also modified the droplet precautions where they replaced the word **""droplet""** to ""**splashes""** making it sound like it required a large volume of fluid for you to get it. You think of splashes you think of a puddle, you think of droplet you think of a raindrop.To get infected with Ebola, it only takes 1 - 10 virus particles, influenza is 100 - 1000 so a droplet is a big deal.Also previous studies on SARS and MERS should be cause for serious concernThe SARS virus (which the Wuhan Coronavirus is 86% similar to) was heavily studied during and after the SARS outbreak of 2003.**CDC Statement on SARS:**“The main way that **SARS seems to spread** is by **close person-to-person contact.** The virus that causes **SARS is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets (droplet spread) produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Droplet spread can happen** when **droplets** from the **cough or sneeze** of an **infected person are propelled a short distance (generally up to 3 feet)** through the air and deposited on the **mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons** who are nearby. The **virus also can spread when a person touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touches his or her mouth, nose, or eye(s).** In addition, it is **possible that the SARS virus might spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not now known**.[https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/fs-closecontact.html](https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/fs-closecontact.html)""**Droplets that are 100 micrometers in diameter were found to travel five times farther than past estimates, while droplets 10 micrometers in diameter were found to travel 200 times farther. In addition, the team found that droplets less that 50 micrometers in size are often able to stay airborne long enough to enter ceiling ventilation units.""**\*\*The corona virus capsid is around 120-125 nm (nano meters) or 0.120 to 0.125 micrometer.An N95 Mask has a .30 pore size[http://news.mit.edu/2014/coughs-and-sneezes-float-farther-you-think](http://news.mit.edu/2014/coughs-and-sneezes-float-farther-you-think)**Toilets**From the article Solving Indoor Airborne Disease Transmission Problems:“**Toilet aerosolization** was the **key factor** in **spreading the 2003 SARS epidemic around the world**. A SARS-infected Chinese doctor stayed at the Metropole Hong Kong hotel and had **diarrhea events in his bathroom located next to the room’s entry door.** Since his **room was positively pressurized to the hallway**, his **aerosolized SARS virions were pushed out into the hallway creating a SARS fecal cloud**. 15 guests and visitors **passed through his SARS fecal cloud** on the ninth-floor common area and **became infected**.“**Every time a toilet is flushed, a fine aerosol mist can be sprayed into the air, over an area of up to 6m2 (64.578 square feet).** This mist may contain many types of fecal bacteria that can cause diseases.”Once airborne, these germs are usually riding on a water droplet that is being sucked upwards at supersonic speeds (to a germ) by the bathroom fan’s vacuum power. That droplet quickly evaporates (in less than a second) and the remaining naked germs are called “droplet nuclei”, which can **stay airborne for hours if not days depending on the air movement within the room.** All toilet aerosolized droplet nuclei lifted up into the breathing zone allow unsuspecting people to breathe them in. Eventually bacteria and virions fall (plate out) like party confetti, dusting every single surface in the bathroom and then spill over into the patient rooms coating them and eventually out their doors into the hospital.”[https://www.esmagazine.com/articles/94845-solving-indoor-airborne-disease-transmission-problems](https://www.esmagazine.com/articles/94845-solving-indoor-airborne-disease-transmission-problems)**Vomit**Vomit can produce a splatter pattern covering 83+ Sq. ft.A study was done to determine the droplet spread of Noroviruses during projectile vomit. They used “Vomiting Larry”; a robot designed to simulate projectile vomit (which is common symptom with both Norovirus and Ebola) to assess “environmental contamination.”The study concluded “Experiments revealed that **splashes** ***(same term the CDC is currently using)*** and **droplets** ***(original term CDC was using)*** produced during an episode of projectile vomiting can travel great distances (>3 m ***(9 feet)*** **forward spread** and 2.6 m ***(7.8 feet)*** **lateral spread**). The research highlighted that small droplets can be hard to see and therefore **cleaning all contaminated surfaces is difficult to achieve**. Evidence from this study suggests that areas of **at least** 7.8 m2 ***(83.9585 square feet)*** should be **decontaminated following an episode of projectile vomiting.**[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1757177414545390](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1757177414545390)**""Sewage Disposal Systems and Spread of Contagions in an Apartment Complex""**A study of a SARS outbreak in 2004 in an apartment complex documents the following process and findings “Yu et al. also modeled the spread of aerosol in the Amoy Gardens housing complex during the outbreak, and their results similarly suggested **an aerosol pathway from the sewage disposal system through dry U-traps in bathroom floor drains induced by bathroom exhaust fans**, with **subsequent exhaust to the open air light well and transport between buildings**, and correlated these with the reporting of the first 187 SARS cases .” These findings appear to provide the best explanation for the pattern of the initial 187 SARS cases in the Amoy Gardens apartments, and offer **strong support for a conclusion that airborne transmission was perhaps the primary mechanism for inter-apartment disease transmission during the initial phase of this outbreak**. Taken together, these studies suggest that SARS CoV **microbial droplet nuclei aerosols produced from contaminated sewage and subsequently transported on air currents may be highly infectious for significant periods and over long distances.**”[https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/panels/hs/papers/hs0423cb2-1824-1e.pdf](https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/panels/hs/papers/hs0423cb2-1824-1e.pdf)[https://plumbingconnection.com.au/new-report-proves-plumbing-link-to-sars/](https://plumbingconnection.com.au/new-report-proves-plumbing-link-to-sars/)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4692156/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4692156/)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29423191](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29423191)",Debate: Do you believe the WHO and CDC are downplaying CoronaVirus to prevent MASS HYSTERIA?,2020-01-31 20:30:47,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ex0tmg/debate_do_you_believe_the_who_and_cdc_are/

I'd reckon it's an international embarrassment at this point because they're actually unable to provide adequate care to the citizens living there.

fg5yiko,-0.9978,0.3182,"A partial translation, starting at about 4:20, that I typed on the fly.There’s two ideas I want to impart to you today.One is the saying “kids who know how to cry will have milk to drink.” Earlier I told you about 8 cases who couldn’t get hospitalization and were begging for help on social media. I talked to 2 of these, and they managed to get spots. I asked to interview them, but they were unwilling to talk. Unless you speak out, the world will not know of your suffering and needs.The second concept is direct evidence and indirect evidence. If you video record John Doe robbing a bank, that’s direct evidence. But if John Doe is usually poor, and now he’s spending money everywhere, you can’t directly say he robbed the bank, but if you put that together with many other data points, you may be able to determine that he robbed the bank.Right now, we don't have much direct evidence. I hope you guys can understand, I'm showing my face and vlogging under my own name. Without direct evidence, I can’t directly deny China’s data or news on the death toll numbers. But we can use many other pieces of indirect evidence to get a picture.For example, the 84 year old woman who died yesterday didn’t go to the hospital to die, but died at home. Was she added to the death count for coronavirus? I can’t determine whether she was or not.I also personally saw three bodies, I went to ask the nurse, and she said we have to wait for the morgues car to come, and they can’t come for awhile. The morgue’s car can’t come - the nurse told me this myself.Yesterday, the 84 year old woman died at 9am, the paperwork was done by 1pm, but by 5pm the morgue’s car had still not come. Now I can’t call again to ask if it’s come, because they’re in mourning and quarantine and I don’t want to keep bothering them.What do these facts mean for us? We’re mature people, I hope you can use your own head to consider what you believe. I can’t use a story, a picture online to tell a story to you.There’s propaganda circulating here, saying Japan sent 100 medics, didn’t see this news overseas. Other fake news was about body bags filling cans outside the morgue. Why would infected body bags be taken off and thrown away instead of burned along with the body?Yesterday my head hurts, I took my temperature, yesterday it’s 36.5, today it’s 36.8. Local doctors say I should get a CT scan to look at the lungs, because some symptoms are not very strong, but once they erupt it’s very severe. I have the dilemma, that if I don’t get treated in Wuhan, it’s very dangerous, but if I do, it’s wasting valuable medical resources here. At least this virus seems to not be very dangerous to young healthy people, if I get infected I will try to rely on my own resources to get over this sickness.Everyone has what they have to do, I tell the world this story, you stay at home and take care of yourself and your family.Some of these patients have to go to 4 or 5 hospitals, have to take a number and wait, and get scans at each.This kind of battle, everyone fights by themselves, but overall it’s very chaotic. If this really is a pandemic, it will be very tragic.","This guy in Wuhan posted another video, can someone translate and post bellow please?",2020-01-31 23:27:00,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ex2ltn/this_guy_in_wuhan_posted_another_video_can/
fg6wgda,0.9794,0.3182,"Since it is a 16 minutes long video, I couldn't really translate the whole video. But there are some information that the reporter in the video (Chen Qiu Shi) said:-His video is all filmed by himself and is free for anyone to share, there is no such thing as copyright in this case.-another thing that I thought really important is that he is WILLING TO ACCEPT INTERVIEW FROM OTHER COUNTRY!!!!! I think this is important as that is how other countries be able to know the truth and facts happen in Wuhan, and Chen Qiu Shi had swore that he ONLY tell truth which is what he actually saw and heard from the ACTUAL workers from hospitals.  as well, he also had said that he wished whichever news company that willing to interview him to put their political view aside and interview him objectively instead of base on stereotypes or bias.Other than these two things I thought that is really important to translate so that you guys can share, he basically was mentioning that everyone should stay calm and objective, try not to easily influence by posted online that are not credible sources and he had confirmed two of the posted that share between Chinese people are fake.As well, there is an concept he talked about that basically saying there is no direct evidence to proof that the government is trying to hide death number, but there are a lot people died OUTSIDE of the hospital which means they are probably NOT counted in the death numbers.  These are pretty much about the video and some points that I think is really important as well Qiu Shi thinks it is important to share.","This guy in Wuhan posted another video, can someone translate and post bellow please?",2020-01-31 23:27:00,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ex2ltn/this_guy_in_wuhan_posted_another_video_can/
