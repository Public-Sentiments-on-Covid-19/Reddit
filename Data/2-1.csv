fg629ic,0.4833,-0.4215,And then the CCP started spreading the bag soup and market videos to cover up what they had done. There was a Harvard professor arrested the other day who was given $1.5 million to build a nanotechnology department in the Wuhan lab.

fg64x3q,-0.6956,-0.4215,"It's attributes are not abnormal for a coronavirus. Your own link to the Lancet journal indicates this. Specifically, ""Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV."" Which is to say, it is not abnormal for a coronavirus at all. It's different, yes, as all different types of coronavirus are. The common cold is a coronavirus, and it's ""abnormal"" compared to SARS and compared to this new virus. That difference is relatively meaningless.The journal article you've linked has been roundly criticized. In fact, your own Lancet journal article confounds their findings without intending to when they discuss the relationship between the genetic differences and the database profile. They even prognosticate a bit there about the most likely connections (hint, it's not HIV) on the way to indicating a third-party transmission between the bat forms, the animal intermediary, and its evolution into something with the ability for human transmission.Your article about the Harvard researcher is unrelated and connected only by your paranoia. And just because a virus is ""new"" and ""different"" than other viruses does not mean that it is any more or less infectious or deadly. Viruses evolve novel forms *all the time;* this is partially why the flu shot changes every year. The R0 and mortality rate is still in dispute, but the idea that this is anything more than a naturally evolved viral mutation is absurd and and posting crap like this is irresponsible on your part.","So after reading two articles, and two medical journals, I have legitimate fears that 2019-nCoV is a manufactured bioweapon that escaped the level four bio lab located in Wuhan.",2020-02-01 01:20:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ex3mjj/so_after_reading_two_articles_and_two_medical/
fg6gue2,-0.4588,-0.4215,"From my own deep dive into this, I would speculate that there is a >50% chance that the likely cause of the outbreak is an accidental laboratory acquired infection (LAI) of a strain of SARS from one of China's infectious disease labs, likely the new biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) lab in Wuhan. Several articles have been written that warn about the poor adherence to proper infectious disease handling protocols in Chinese research and testing laboratories. Articles also detail several instances where SARS escaped from laboratories via infection of lab workers in both China (2004) and Singapore (2003). Therefore, it is not stretch by any means that this may have been the potential cause of the current 2019-nCoV outbreak.Sources:WHO - Virology Lab Is Focus Of Latest SARS Outbreak In China (May, 2004) : https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/05/040510020956.htmJournal article detailing SARS LAI from a BSL-3 lab in Singapore in August, 2003 (Article from 2004): https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa032565More recent large LAI event (disease other than SARS)Chinese institutes investigate pathogen outbreaks in lab workers (December, 2019): https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03863-z","So after reading two articles, and two medical journals, I have legitimate fears that 2019-nCoV is a manufactured bioweapon that escaped the level four bio lab located in Wuhan.",2020-02-01 01:20:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ex3mjj/so_after_reading_two_articles_and_two_medical/

He has been spreading it over 2 islands for god knows how long, obviously, the authorities are also hiding this information (a local canary island news paper found out this)I‚Äôm from Spain and just watched this in the news. This guy came with 5 German friends in a plane to la gomera island, he got infected from a coworker in Germany who travelled to China for business. Therefore, my logic says, that the chances more people got infected in the 4hour flight are pretty high. Here in Spain, our new government is taking this as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù, you can see the guy infected in the news sunbathing at the balcony of the hospital with sunglasses like nothing is going on. Is this how you are supposed to treat a confirmed infected patient? Also, another brilliant idea of our Goverment, the 12 Spanish people who were trapped in wuhan and were deported back to Spain, they sent them to a hospital IN MADRID.

Initially he published a public appeal for adherent, observing Tibetan Buddhists around the world to join in repeating certain mantras and prayers, which is essentially comparable to a well known Christian figure urging others Christians to join in prayer, an act of solidarity to ask for the safety and health of the people suffering. >In the wake of the recent Coronavirus outbreak, the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL) issued a public appeal, urging Tibetans worldwide to observe select prayers aimed at overcoming the effects of the epidemic.>Please be advised that the instructions are based on Buddhist traditional beliefs and can be effectively practised by Buddhist adherents who regularly observe Buddhist mantras and prayers.You can see the actual memo here: https://tibet.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/prayers.pdf#SecondAll of this is stemming from a ‚Äúnews story‚Äù posted by the Central Tibetan Administration about an exchange between HH Dalai Lama and an individual Chinese follower who reached out for advice on behalf of all Chinese adherents. He responded with virtually the same advice for a  call to prayer and pointing to the Tara Mantra.Regardless, he was certainly not saying ‚Äújust say these words a bunch and you will be safe or it will cure you and you don‚Äôt need doctors or to wear masks‚Äù. He was just responding to a plea for spiritual guidance in a time of chaos and despair.What doesn‚Äôt seem to be clear is how/or where this exchange actually took place, but it appears to have been by a representative of a group of Chinese followers asking him HHDL directly on Facebook, to which HH responded and ostensibly sent him a clip or a link to a clip of the Mantra that he discussed. This seemed to be a direct conversation and not a public statement. TheCTA then took this exchange and repackaged it a bit to make a news story out of it. It is never reported that HH sent the man a SoundCloud clip, only that he shared a clip of the mantra with him as an example. The CTA are the ones that linked directly to a SoundCloud clip and it may or may not even be what was sent to the man as example. It could even be the man himself that then went and uploaded the clip. Who knows.It does not appear that the SoundCloud account hosting the upload is an official one belonging to HH Dalai Lama, it has very few followers and it lists their location as Arlington Texas. The attached Facebook profile is just some random person, and the attached YouTube account is just an aggregator channel of Dalai Lama clips curated from other places.> A group of Chinese Buddhists and devout followers of His Holiness the Dalai Lama from mainland China sought His Holiness‚Äô spiritual advice on ways to contain the spread of Coronavirus, a recently discovered airborne disease which has gripped national attention as well as globally after it spread rapidly across China and to other parts of the world.>In response, His Holiness told them that chanting Tara mantra as much as possible could help contain the spread of the epidemic.

Its usually cheap, and nothing will go to waste so youre not really throwing your money away.Secondly get some protection ready like a mask, anti-bacterial soap, gloves.Thirdly, try to learn new habits. Washing your hands, keeping a distance of crowds, properly washing food before preparing and eating them etc.Lastly, being glued to your screen for 24h in order to get any sort of news on the topic the moment it becomes available is not healthy in many ways.

Every ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù source coming out of China indicates that this is a much more serious situation than what is being ‚Äúofficially‚Äù reported.So let‚Äôs analyze the situation:1. We have a huge (and expanding) quarantine effort, covering many 10s of millions.2. We have a three week trend-line that was following a ~2.3 r0 geometric progression of cases, then suddenly it ‚Äúmiraculously‚Äù slows down, hitting a rather odd ‚Äúlimit‚Äù of ~3000 new cases a day, which may indicate either data manipulation or an inability to scale detection and reporting of the virus: https://www.biancoresearch.com/coronavirus-charts-for-january-16-2020-day-16/ .3. We now have major western media outlets beginning to openly question Beijing‚Äôs statistics:  https://www.wsj.com/articles/relatives-wonder-whether-pneumonia-deaths-were-tied-to-coronavirus-11579915630.4. We have a slowly issued, but escalating, set of warnings coming from the WHO and national governments.5. We have significant anecdotal, but unverifiable, reports and visual evidence that indicates that the situation in Wuhan is significantly worse than what is officially being reported.6. We have an unprecedented effort, even by PRoC standards, to control the narrative and suppress information. 7. The WHO and US CDC are still not effectively ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù in China, having only been ‚Äúinvited‚Äù two days ago (the WHO pandering to the PRoC, during their emergency declaration, was most likely to ensure that the visit wasn‚Äôt cancelled, as it would appear the WHO and CDC are struggling to get a complete picture of events).8. Reports indicate that there is now a significant shortage of test kits in the impacted areas, along with shortages of hospital space and supplies (likely playing role in point 2, above).In short: we really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. We do know that the PRoC is a totalitarian surveillance-state that has invested massive resources in controlling what their citizens say and see, while protecting the internal and international prestige of the PRoC and the CCP. It‚Äôs an established fact that the CCP will actively lie to protect its interests, that the party has an 80 year history (still underway) of undertaking brutal and genocidal forms of oppression, having exacted one of the highest (possibly the highest) historical death-tolls of any political party or movement.With all this in mind, nobody should trust anything coming out of official PRoC ‚Äúinformation‚Äù sources.

(259 deaths) / (12024 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rateWhile this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".#The Lancet Studyhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltextA study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. We have to keep in mind that people in this study were not young an healthy to begin with.#Reported Numbers vs RealityThe reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because Chinese hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Also, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around.  There have even been cases where people were tested positive for the virus and had no symptoms at all, so we really have no idea of the true number of infected people. However, we can safely assume that total number of infected is much much more than the reported confirmed cases.There's also the very likely possibility that even the reported numbers are inaccurate, as China's officials could be reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various political and economic reasons. Even if the true number of deaths would be a lot higher than reported, the actual number of infected could easily be higher than 200 000 which means the mortality rate is still low. It's very unlikely that mortality rate of this illness ends up being higher than **5%**.#ComparisonFor comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses and seasonal flu: * SARS (**11%**)* MERS (**35%**)* Seasonal Flu (**less than 0.1%**)",For people asking why mortality rate is only 2-3% when fatalities = recoveries,2020-02-01 09:30:38,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ex9idh/for_people_asking_why_mortality_rate_is_only_23/

No one is heading to a crowded hospital when they are 24 hours from death. They are staying home and not subjecting themselves to that in their last hours.

fg7zsyw,-0.9056,0.0,"Thanks I really appreciate that. J think because I have a different take on how the sub runs it instantly got labeled as solely a conspiracy theory sub when it is *not that* at all, nor is it a sub for soom porn or scare mongering. It's just my opinion that underplaying in a situation like this is *equally if not more* dangerous than exaggerating is. This is serious. Thos does have a serious potential to effect every one of us. No the world isnt ending and I dont believe it's the apocalypse... but I also am not naive enough to believe this is as ""harmless as the flu/should be more worried about the flu/if you're not worried about the flu why are you worried now"" ... in my personal opinion this smug arrogance will be what allows this to keep manifesting the way it has. Just because the little factual information we have is alarming and scary, does not mean its alarmist or scare mongering imo to tall about it. I also believe that just because something is not verified does not mean its suddenly invalidates any discussion on it. For example the common 2% mortality rate quoted is *not a fact*. It *is a fact* that several models have projected it to be as low as 2%. It is *not a fact* the mortality rate is 10%+. It *is a fact* that some modems have projected the mortality rate to possibly be 10% or higher. Those 4 sentences are based on the same factual information but mean 2 completely different things and *none* of it has been peer reviewed.

They used to just do the cremations in the morning as it takes a long time and shut down at night. Now they‚Äôve been told to do them ASAP as a disease containment thing. Ergo, they run 24/7. That in itself means nothing. They‚Äôve been told to burn a body as soon as possible to stop infection. There‚Äôs no numbers to go by as it‚Äôs all second, third hand stuff. We know the numbers will be higher than official figures of course, but again we don‚Äôt actually have any evidence. This video doesn‚Äôt tell us anything other than the order to burn bodies instantly.Also that 30% is the upper limit annually that we typically see winter deaths increase month on month. It‚Äôs for comparison and won‚Äôt at this time feature wuhan virus deaths. I agree 4x the reported number of dead is easily possible... but the only evidence we have for that is theoretical models of the disease. The reports of crematoriums running 24/7 do not cite the reason as because they have to to get through the bodies, and provide no information to suggest that‚Äôs the case.Edit: yes, I can now find articles describing exactly this - funerals are banned as gatherings and bodies are to be burnt ASAP by regulation.",Wuhan Crematorium is running 24 hours a day?,2020-02-01 12:18:28,/r/Coronavirus/comments/exby26/wuhan_crematorium_is_running_24_hours_a_day/

fg878ls,0.8873,0.552,"Imo medical journals create a sort of monopoly on information that is predatory. I recognize that by providing peer review they add an value to the research they choose to publish BUT I think that by monopolizing the publication of that information they are able to ask for a much higher price than the value they add. In my ideal world the peer review process would be separated from the publication and every article would be available to every publisher. That way the publishers would have to provide a competitive service too instead of capitalizing solely on their information monopoly. People could choose to subscribe to the publication with the best UI or what ever quality they valued and no publication would be able to ask an outrageous price or everyone would leave them for their competitors. Seems to me like this process would make information more accessible. In lieu of that, I'm personally a staunch piracy advocate when it comes to punishing predatory monopolies so this project gets 2 thumbs up from me.","The Coronavirus Papers unlocked: 5,352 scientific articles covering the coronavirus - fully searchable and free.",2020-02-01 14:32:41,/r/Coronavirus/comments/exdtjt/the_coronavirus_papers_unlocked_5352_scientific/

According to the regulations, after the death of patients with new crown pneumonia, the medical institution where they are located reports the health and administrative department at the same level, the health and administrative department notifies the civil affairs department at the same level, and the civil affairs department notifies the relevant funeral home to make preparations for the transportation and cremation of the remains. For the remains of dead patients with neo-coronary pneumonia, the medical staff of the medical institution where they are located shall disinfect and seal the remains in accordance with the ""Technical Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of New Coronavirus Infection in Medical Institutions (First Edition)"", and it is strictly forbidden to open them after sealing.The medical institution shall contact the funeral home as soon as possible after the completion of the sanitary and epidemic prevention treatment of the remains, issue a death certificate, and contact the relatives to agree to the cremation, and indicate in the transfer of the remains that the sanitary and epidemic prevention treatment has been carried out and the opinion of immediate cremation. If the relatives of patients with new coronary pneumonia refuse to be present or refuse to transfer the remains, they shall be persuaded by medical institutions and funeral parlours. If the persuasion is invalid, the medical institutions shall sign the remains and submit them to the funeral parlor for direct cremation. The public security organs in the jurisdiction shall cooperate in the relevant work.Regarding the transfer of corpses, the transportation of corpses must not be undertaken by units and individuals other than funeral homes. The funeral home will arrange full-time personnel and special corpses to the designated place of the medical institution, and transfer the remains to the designated special corpses according to the designated route to the funeral home. The disease prevention and control institution shall instruct medical personnel, personnel for the transportation and disposal of remains, etc., to carry out health protection in accordance with the requirements for protection from disease exposure.After the remains were delivered to the funeral parlour, the funeral parlour set up a special temporary passageway, and the funeral parlor's full-time staff directly sent the remains to a special cremation furnace for cremation. Remains must not be stored or visited, and it is strictly forbidden to open the sealed remains bag during the whole process. After the cremation was completed, the ashes of the funeral home were picked up by the service staff of the funeral home, and a cremation certificate was issued, which was handed over to relatives to take away. If the family refuses to take it away, it shall be treated as ashes of an unclaimed body.The remains of patients with neo-coronary pneumonia who died in this province (district, city) should be cremated nearby, and no burial or other means of preservation should be used, nor should they be removed. Remains of patients with neo-coronary pneumonia who died outside of this province (region, city) should not enter the province's territory and be cremated on the spot in accordance with the principle of proximity. After the death of patients with New Coronary Pneumonia, no farewell ceremony of corpses and other forms of funeral activities shall be conducted.According to the provisions of the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, the remains of patients with new crown pneumonia of ethnic minorities must be cremated on the spot.

fgc0b6j,-0.3641,0.0,"Cough medicine with dextromethorphan in it. There are lots of cold and flu formulations without actual cough suppressant in them. Check with a pharmacist if you have a heart condition though.Guafenisen or ‚Äòmucinex‚Äô is supposedly an expectorant. The idea is that if you have a medication containing dextromethorphan and guafenisen then you will cough less but your coughs will be more productive when they happen. Personally I hate this stuff cuz I cough like a cancer laden smoker, but other people report satisfaction with its effects. For the record I do have to say that empirical studies are conflicted about whether there is a benefit in using cough medicine at all, regardless of what type. I don‚Äôt think herbal medicines are reliable because they‚Äôre impossible to control for purity and potency, but elderberry has shown cautious promise as an antiviral similar to ( but weaker than) tamiflu. Teas and syrups are available. I don‚Äôt put much stock in it on its own, but when I get sick with a virus i take elderberry syrup with my cough syrup and drink the tea preparations along with my preferred neocitran formulation. At the very least, I don‚Äôt think it hurts. Antipyretics like acetaminophen/paracetamol are staples of essential medicine. This is often an ingredient in cold and flu medications so be mindful of accidentally taking too much in a day. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen/paracetamol have wide adoption as a potent pain killing formulation in the wake of opiate crises. Unlike opiates, these drugs don‚Äôt lead to chemical dependency. Taken together they appear to be very effective in managing most mild to moderate levels of pain. A decongestant like phenylephrine or an antihistamine diphenhydramine is also a common addition in cold and flu remedies. Some antihistamines can lend themselves to constipation, so if you use them and your not sure they won‚Äôt have t hi s effect on you, you might pick up some osmotic laxative like PEG 3350, lactulose (usually behind the counter), or glycerin suppositories. Cough drops mad lozenges with anesthetic in them will be very helpful in offering relief from sore throats. Crap cold has lozenges with benzocaine in them that I would recommend. If you can‚Äôt find lozenges with anesthetic in them, menthol in a lozenge will still provide some comfort. It‚Äôs not medicine, but I would also encourage anyone who is listening to pick up Gatorade or Powerade crystals, even prepared bottles. If your sick you need your hydration and your electrolytes. Don‚Äôt buy sugar free, you need that sugar. Pedialyte is also a good choice, but not everyone can stomach that stuff. I would also recommend some easy, prepackaged, high calorie snacks to put next to your sick bed.

Disaster strikes and effect is immediate whereas this has so many unknown factors.  Not saying obviously that the government is without fault and I don‚Äôt believe in the official numbers they release because in truth, they have been always criticized for very closed on information.  But it would be good to know whether there is international protocol on reporting process for these infectious diseases that the Chinese government did not ‚Äúadhere‚Äù to or whether they didn‚Äôt think it was as infectious at the beginning (underestimates severity) until their efforts in containment became a little too late.

fgaj5f9,0.5392,-0.5563,"As a general rule of thumb, people succumb to normality bias. If the lights are one, water comes out the tap, their phone works and Netflix still streams, they will continue on, even when faced with pretty alarming evidence that everything is not okay. I can tell you from personal first-hand experience, that this is true for the managing editors and producers at major media outlets, who are about as ‚Äúbasic‚Äù a bunch of people you will ever meet. This is why obvious brewing disasters often go underreported until they‚Äôre a huge mess, and are then qualified as ‚Äúblack-swans‚Äù, even when the data or information was readily available.It‚Äôs not entirely a conspiracy; yes the PRoC is suppressing information, and as that‚Äôs the current epicenter, it means little verifiable data beyond their (highly suspect) ‚Äúofficial‚Äù reports is available; that part is conspiratorial (as is the nature of communist regimes). However, the free-world media, simply doesn‚Äôt have much direct reporting they can do. This combined with normality bias, a similar lack of data from the WHO and CDC (who are also largely in the dark), means all they can do is limited reporting on official PRoC sanctioned data, or they fall into the realm of speculation on a subject that normalcy bias doesn‚Äôt exactly entice one to speculate or push boundaries on. It‚Äôs far more interesting (for them) to cover politically charged, and immediately gratifying (for the media) stories about local political machinations or dramatically burning forests somewhere. Stock footage of people in hospitals, discussions of potential statistical progressions, questioning ‚Äúofficial‚Äù numbers, etc., doesn‚Äôt sell advertising all that well. Not until it‚Äôs on that media outlet‚Äôs doorstep.However, once it‚Äôs a clear and present danger to the managing editors and the producers at major media, expect 24/7 coverage with endless and absurd speculation.

We beat it by learning it's limits, then stepping outside those limits. But all the misinformation in the msm, like the 2-3% mortality rate lie the simpletons in the msm calculate by dividing cases by deaths & keep parroting. Or the lie that asymptomatic transmission isn't possible, most politicians assured us about right up until yesterday, even though their counterparts in China had informed them otherwise almost a week ago.

fgakbk9,-0.936,0.0,"This virus itself likely isnt the armageddon virus people are afraid of but at this point your unrest is pretty justified (although panic wouldnt be) for a few reasons. For one it still appears to be totally uncontained and we still dont have a good guess as to what the fatality rate it plus theres a higher chance of it mutating the more generations the virus is allowed to have. Two is that the legacy media has been under reporting this issue but if the goobernment cant get this thing under control people will start to figure it out and theyll panic. That's the most dangerous part for you. A paralyzed healthcare system and, during a bad panic, the economic slowdown. If enough people get sick people refuse to go to work (which happens sometimes) in a country with such a large landmass and so many urban centers located so far from the places where the food is grown it doesnt take much to cripple the massive, elaborate supply chain that brings more chicken nuggets to your local grocery store twice a week even if you're out in the sticks where the farms are.

fgbkkse,0.1958,0.0,"It's very difficult to say what is real, given the lack of transparency the Chinese people can provide over social media, in combination with propaganda from the communists. The truth is, there is no way an independent nurse can give a number like 90,000. Who's performing that test? Where is the data? The truth is somewhere in the middle. Her experience confirmed to her that the numbers (the low thousands at the time) were unreported, and thus she did some quick estimating. Most people in the USA haven't even seen that video. Some people are prone to panic. In the early days, the WHO wasn't declaring it a serious emergency, and so people feared the spread. Luckily, the administration in the USA is taking this problem seriously. With a massive response to potential cases, the chances that you will have anything to fear in the USA is low. However, this particular virus does seem to have a high R0. If something that looked like an outbreak started happening in your locality, you can be assured that the national guard will be coming to shut down your city. This is why people are recommending a stockpile of food and supplies. Quarantine is a real possibility. During an event like a quarantine, some criminals may see the situation as an opportunity, which is why you need self-defense capabilities. But quarantine shouldn't be scary. It's one of the most effective weapons we have against a virus. People who are telling you to be prepared, are really just telling you to be ready for quarantine. This is solid advice. A little over ten years ago, I went with a team of volunteers to a rural town in central Indiana. We went to distribute food and supplies to people who weren't prepared. You see, a rare 100 year storm came through, and half the town was below the water table. Once it became obvious that these homes were going to be under 20 feet of water, the national guard and local cops came around and told people they had two (or less) minutes to leave. Some people had prepared for an event, but most people hadn't. We found some people with nothing but their car (if they were lucky) some pajamas, and whatever was in their trunk. This wasn't even a national emergency, this only effected maybe 800 people. (If I had to guess.) It barely made the news. Local disasters like this one happen on the regular.
