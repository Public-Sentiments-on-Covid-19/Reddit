fh84yyd,-0.9778,-0.7351,"I am Asian myself. I do not believe it is racist to avoid Asians because they’re by far the most likely demographic to have the virus. You cannot tell someone’s travel history at a glance, nor can you interview every Asian you see on the street, so avoidance is practical risk reduction. I am not offended when people avoid me, as I cannot blame them. Even I cannot tell the people of each country apart perfectly just by looking at them. I can’t tell if a white person came from Norway or US or England or France. I can’t tell if an Asian person came from China or Taiwan or Hong Kong or Korea.It is not racist to be worried about this virus. The CCP is being dishonest, it is a major threat, and you should prepare to deal with it. I don’t mind the virus memes, either. Humor is good for dark times.What I do take issue with, though, is when people are assaulted, pelted with eggs, struck, and ridiculed because of their skin color. That is actual racism, crosses the line, and several instances of such behavior emerged. How does this behavior help us against the virus? It only causes people to make enemies of each other. The perpetrators of these acts also increase the risk of infection because they are purposely getting in close proximity of people they do not know, who happen to be the demographic most likely to have the virus right now. These are also actual criminal acts people have no business so brazenly defending.Avoiding people without physically attacking them like a street punk should not be difficult.  If this is a revelation for whoever is reading this, which I hope it is not, please get your head out of your ass. You’re not helping against the virus, only causing discord. If anyone deserves your anger it is the CCP.Do not forget what makes most western governments infinitely better than the CCP. Encouragement of discourse and actual respect for humanity without losing sight of real issues. Be an informed and reasonable citizen who respects his/her neighbors and community. Do not allow the degeneracy of the CCP as an excuse to be a degenerate yourself.The bad news is avoiding Asians is no longer reasonable once the virus spreads throughout a melting pot like the USA, which I believe it will eventually. Because then anyone could likely have it. People of all races are affected.

Our society seems blissfully unaware of the aftermath of a short-term disease, virus, parasite, bacteria etc.  It can mess up your health long-term. I can't even imagine how you would prep for the decline that I've personally experienced at age 23 after having malaria and then getting diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).  Apparently 560,000 Canadians have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (And 2.5 million Americans) which is often brought on after an short-term illness, as simple as the flu,  H1N1, lots of patients have it after EBV, after dengue fever, malaria, etc.   When I heard of this outbreak I thought first of the deaths and how that is going to impact loved ones, but then I thought of how many people are never going to have their health ever return, who will be diagnosed with Post-viral fatigue syndrome/ Chronic fatigue syndrome/  Myalgic encephalomyelitis. They'll find themselves in a new kind of hell, what some patients describe as a living death- while everyone else moves on. 14 days of quarantine won't even be good preparation for the isolation that comes with being housebound or bedbound for decades.   You can learn more about CFS here: [https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html)  If you wanted to donate to CFS research please consider it or writing to your government official and asking for more research dollars. We are fighting for equitable funding with similarly disabling illnesses.  Hopefully they'll make more discoveries about why some of us develop some sort of nervous system/immume disorder after viruses, infections etc. And how to switch us back to good health!

fh8b4sr,-0.9313,-0.5994,"I think the death rate is much higher. Here are some numbers I was putting together:One of things that never added up to me is how can the number of deaths so far cause the crematories to run 24/7 and become overloaded. I feel the numbers would need to be much higher than that.So I did some digging on how China’s death rate, calculated average number of people die per day, then added in what the extra load of the Coronavirus would put on the crematories.Well to make things easier I found this:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_funeral_ritualsSo in 2014 there were 9.77 million deaths in China. Of these, 4.46 million were cremated, or 45.6% of deaths.This equates to 12,219 bodies being cremated per day under normal circumstances in 2014, population has grown since then so probably slightly higher for 2019.To date there have been a little over 900 deaths world wide. Even if all these people died on the same day, and all in China,  that would mean a 7% increase in crematories. We know that is not the case though (I haven’t been keeping track of the daily death breakdown in each city - might be useful)One flaw to this is that I don’t know the number of crematoriums in China and how that 12,219 daily number would be spread out amongst them.

Let's say this coronavirus kills no one, zero percent (I know that's not true, but let's say hypothetically it was), but it spreads and catches as we've seen, and people get sick and go down. All of those people out of work while sick and recovering, all the people out of work taking care of them, the general effect all of this has as it spreads and more people don't go to work on general principles...  that seems like a big deal. First, travel and lots of business stops in China. That's a loss to anyone connected with transportation (to/from China to start) or manufacturing. Can't get goods on time from China? Including pharmaceuticals? That sounds like a big problem, one that ripples all over the world. China not selling, making or shipping anywhere close to where it was, the rest of the world not buying or replacing because China isn't selling/making/shipping where it was, and the issues that causes, and all those people downstream - sick, caregiving, or just worried - not reporting for work.

I also would like to add this hypothetical/ possible scenerio:Suppose you are like one of us (someone more aware of the situation than someone who just watches MSM) and a few weeks go by.  You basically are pretty sure the virus has reached your area.  Your not really hearing too much about it but you notice some people at your work are coughing and ""have a cold"".  Even if they've been to the doctor, they probably haven't tested them.  Now you have to make a decision.  Your work is not going to let you take off for an extended period of time because you are worried about catching it.  Remember, they think you are ridiculous for worrying and even if they suspected an actual case of CV, they don't tell people because they are already shorthanded on staff/ employees.  You  can't afford to quit.  What do you do?  The type of work I do is Home care related where they can't run shorthanded like a retail setting.  I believe they would hide any suspected or confirmed cases from the employees. Another reason employers may hide cases is because if you contract an illness at work,  you are entitled to workmans comp and your medical care covered.  They are not going to want you knowing where you got it.  Even though contracting a disease is covered by workmans comp,  it's harder to prove than if you have a fall or other injuries.  And because of HIPPA,  Your not going to find out if someone is infected if they don't want you to know,  Or if they haven't been properly diagnosed.","When you hear people downplaying the virus by focusing on the death rate, consider this…",2020-02-10 05:13:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1q45x/when_you_hear_people_downplaying_the_virus_by/

I have received panicked queries from journalists and public health workers in China, asking, “How can we protect ourselves and our families?”The epidemic could have been [controlled fairly easily](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/24/opinions/wuhan-coronavirus-china-strategy-garrett/index.html) three weeks ago had there been more openness, swift action, and no attempted cover-up. But now it’s too late, and this virus is [spreading globally](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/24/wuhan-virus-china-belt-and-road-pandemic/). Because there is no vaccine or treatment for nCoV2019—the Wuhan pneumonia—and infection has spread throughout China, the government is forced to turn to its 2003 SARS playbook. And that means entire cities must be cut off, and the population of the nation must be restricted in its movements and potential disease-spreading behavior. It is not surprising then that travel out of Beijing may be forbidden; the entire mainland could go on lockdown soon.I know people are very frightened. And I expect panic will rise in the coming days. But very simple measures can protect you.During the SARS epidemic, I traveled all over China and Hong Kong, interviewed people infected with the virus, doctors and nurses treating the disease, government officials, police—everybody. I was never concerned that I would become infected, despite being in the room with sick individuals. And that’s because I knew what precautions to take. Here are the most important ones to know:**1. When you leave your home, wear gloves**—winter mittens or outdoor gloves—and keep them on in subways, buses, and public spaces.**2. If you are in a social situation where you should remove your gloves,** perhaps to shake hands or dine, do not touch your face or eyes, no matter how much something itches. Keep your hands away from contact with your face. And before you put your gloves back on, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water, scrubbing the fingers. Put your gloves on.**3. Change gloves daily,** washing them thoroughly, and avoid wearing damp gloves.**4. Masks are useless when worn outdoors and may not be very helpful even indoors.** Most masks deteriorate after one or two wearings. Using the same mask day after day is worse than useless—it’s disgusting, as the contents of your mouth and nose eventually coat the inside of the mask with a smelly veneer that is attractive to bacteria. I rarely wear a face mask in an epidemic, and I have been in more than 30 outbreaks. Instead, I stay away from crowds, and I keep my distance from individual people—a half meter, about 1.5 feet, is a good standard. If someone is coughing or sneezing, I ask them to put on a mask—to protect me from their potentially contaminated fluids. If they decline, I step a meter (about 3 feet) away from them, or I leave. Don’t shake hands or hug people—politely beg off, saying it’s better for both of you not to come in close contact during an epidemic.**5. Inside your household, remove all of the towels from your bathrooms and kitchen immediately,** and replace them with clean towels that have the names of each family member on them. Instruct everybody in your home to only use their own towels and never touch another family member’s. Wash all towels twice a week. Damp towels provide terrific homes for viruses, like common colds, flus, and, yes, coronaviruses.**6. Be careful with doorknobs.** If it’s possible to open and close doors using your elbows or shoulders, do so. Wear gloves to turn a doorknob—or wash your hands after touching it. If anybody in your home takes sick, wash your doorknobs regularly. Similarly, be cautious with stairway banisters, desktops, cell phones, toys, laptops—any objects that are hand-held. As long as you handle only your own personal objects, you will be ok—but if you need to pick up someone else’s cell phone or cooking tools or use someone else’s computer keyboard, be mindful of not touching your face and wash your hands immediately after touching the object.**7. If you share meals, do not use your personal chopsticks and utensils** to remove food from a serving bowl or plate and, of course, tell your children to never drink out of anybody else’s cups or from a container of shared fluid. It is customary in China to prepare several dishes for a meal and then allow everybody at the table to use their personal chopsticks to pull food from the common dishes: Don’t do this until the epidemic is over. Place serving spoons in each dish and instruct everybody at the table to scoop what they want from the serving dishes onto their personal plates or bowls, return the serving spoon to the main dish, and then use their personal chopsticks only to pick food from their personal plate or bowl into their mouth. Wash all food and kitchenware thoroughly between meals and avoid restaurants that have poor hygiene practices.**8. Absolutely do not buy, slaughter, or consume any live animal** or fish until it is known what species was the source of the virus.**9. When the weather allows, open your windows** at home or work, letting your space air out. The virus cannot linger in a well-ventilated space. But of course, if it is cold or the weather is inclement, keep warm and close those windows.**10. Finally, if you are caring for a friend or family member who is running a fever,** always wear a tight-fitting mask when you are near them, and place one on the ailing person (unless they are nauseated). When you replace an old, dirty mask from the face of your friend or loved one be very, very careful—assume, for the sake of your protection, that it is covered in viruses, and handle it while wearing latex gloves, place it inside of a disposable container, seal it, and then put it in the trash. While wearing those latex gloves, gently wash the patient’s face with warm soap and water, using a disposable paper towel or cotton swab, and seal it after use in a container or plastic bag before placing it in your household trash. Wear long-sleeved shirts and clothing that covers your body when you are caring for your ailing friend or relative. Clean everything your patient wears or touches very thoroughly in hot soapy water, including sheets, towels, and utensils. If you have space, isolate the sick person in your household in a room, or a corner of a room, where they are comfortable, but separated from the rest of the household. If the weather is tolerable, open a window that is on the opposite side of the room, so that air gently blows past the patient’s face and then outdoors. Of course, don’t do this if it is very cold, as your friend or loved one will be made sicker if uncomfortably cold.",Laurie Garrett: The Wuhan Virus: How to Stay Safe,2020-02-10 11:43:06,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1vmpo/laurie_garrett_the_wuhan_virus_how_to_stay_safe/

However, the speed at which this occurs is the key.  A critical problem in China is that there are so many sick people there that the medical system completely collapsed (at least in Wuhan) to the point that they can’t even provide adequate supportive therapy.

The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those most at risk were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. By August, when the second wave began in France, Sierra Leone, and the United States,[74] the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form. October 1918 was the deadliest month of the whole pandemic.[75]>**This increased severity has been attributed to the circumstances of the First World War.[76] In civilian life, natural selection favors a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus.** The second wave began, and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics, health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).[77] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#Deadly_second_wave",Is it true that the SECOND wave of the Spanish Flu was actually way deadiler then the first wave?,2020-02-10 12:45:02,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1wlar/is_it_true_that_the_second_wave_of_the_spanish/

What I've learned from this is that they don't have top notch hygiene over in China. Maybe this is more of a rural issue (??) and it spreads into the city, I'm not sure, but unless one is EATING a Wild Animal that is not fit for Human Consumption, then washing your hands will take care of the overall nasties that could infect a person, and lead to this issue that is occurring now.As a side note, I went back and watched the movie Contagion.

Last year was also a reasonably easy season. This would be cool to see 17-18 vs 19-20 that was a bad year for the flu. I repeat this everytime but people need to understand it and even if it helps one person get it I'm cool with that. You need to get your flu shot. I promise big pharma has fuck all to do with the flu shot they make more off of you getting the flu.Years we have a bad match (like part of thos year although the type b Victorian strain was a match) you still have some antibodies to any strain when it gets you so your body had a better ability to fight it off. It's like if we have a 40% match well 40% of that flu you're immune to. Getting the shot every year just expands your immunity so when you're 60 and it can kill you you stand a better chance.

The way these studies work is that you take a number of assumptions and then form models (expressed in equations) that show the correlation and effect of changes in different parameters (like mortality rate, how infectious something is, incubation time and so on). Since all of these are extremely complicated mathematical expressions where all you’d basically see is different numbers and symbols als placeholders for these parameters, researchers like to fill in for these with made up parameters. Repeat, these are made up or taken from similar situations. The real info you get is hence not the numerical results (since these are just examplinary) but how much a change in what parameter affects the overall results. This helps allocate resources better for example.

fh9nf0l,-0.9929,0.2263,"Copied here -  LUSAKA, Zambia — At a Chinese-run hospital in Zambia, some employees watched as people who recently returned from China showed up with coughs but were not placed in isolation. A doctor tending to those patients has stopped coming to work, and health workers have been ordered not to speak publicly about the new virus that has killed hundreds around the world.The virus that has [spread through much of China](https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/30/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency/) has yet to be confirmed in Africa, but global health authorities are increasingly worried about the threat to the continent where an estimated 1 million Chinese now live, as some health workers on the ground warn they are not ready to handle an outbreak.Countries are [racing to take precautions](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/07/hospitals-harnessing-resources-brace-spike-coronavirus-cases/) as hundreds of travelers arrive from China every day. Safeguards include stronger surveillance at ports of entry and improved quarantine and testing measures across Africa, home to 1.2 billion people and some of the world’s weakest systems for detecting and treating disease.But the effort has been complicated by a critical shortage of testing kits and numerous illnesses that display symptoms similar to the flu-like virus.“The problem is, even if it’s mild, it can paralyze the whole community,” said Dr. Michel Yao, emergency operations manager in Africa for the World Health Organization.Those growing worried include employees at the Sino-Zambia Friendship Hospital in the mining city of Kitwe in northern Zambia, near the Congo border. Chinese companies operate mines on the outskirts of the city of more than half a million people. One company is headquartered in Wuhan, the city at the center of the virus outbreak. Hundreds of workers traveled between Zambia and China in recent weeks.“We’re definitely not prepared. If we had a couple of cases, it would spread very quickly,” physiotherapist Fundi Sinkala said. “We’re doing the best we can with what resources we have.”The Sino-Zambia Friendship Hospital, or Sinozam, a low-slung facility near the city’s train station, has taken some precautions, including checking patient temperatures with infrared thermometers and establishing isolation areas. Employees wear masks. Gloves, disinfectant and oxygen inhalers have been stockpiled. Sinozam treats many Chinese in Kitwe and its precautions go further than other hospitals in the area.But the employees and others familiar with the matter, some of whom spoke anonymously under the new rules, say some Chinese patients checked in with coughs and fevers but did not get placed in isolation.Visiting Zambian health officials concluded the patients did not merit special treatment and did not take samples to test for the virus. After the people recovered, they were sent home with antibiotics, employees said.On Wednesday, the hospital set up a new fever clinic, to which people arriving with a high temperature are now ushered to right away. It’s “unfortunate” the ward wasn’t set up earlier, Sinkala said.Two people familiar with the matter say a doctor tending to the sick has fallen ill. Dr. Yu Jianlan has not come to work in the past week and hospital administrators have not explained her absence, Sinkala said. The other person spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.Hospital administrator Li Zhibing said there were no patients with a fever and said Yu had a urinary tract infection, not a fever. But a notice posted by the Zambia-China Cooperation Zone, which manages the hospital, quoted an employee as saying on Jan. 27 that the facility “probably sees 120 fever patients a day, and at least 70 of them are carrying germs” of various diseases.Earlier this week, a Zambian official acknowledged for the first time that his country was following up on an unspecified number of suspected cases. Zambia is one of 13 African countries identified by WHO as a high priority because of busy travel links with China.Copperbelt provincial health director Dr. Robert Zulu, who oversees Kitwe and the surrounding region, told The Associated Press he would not discuss details, citing privacy. But he added, “when any case is confirmed, you will be informed.”Crucially, no one in Zambia has been able to test for the virus so far. Like most African countries, it has been waiting for a substance known as a reagent, which labs require to confirm whether a patient is infected. Labs in just six of Africa’s 54 countries were equipped as of mid-week. That means a wait of two or more days to know whether a sample shipped to South Africa or even outside the continent tests positive.Without testing, officials are “just relying on the symptoms” and whether they persist. “But from what we are learning right now, some people show hardly any symptoms at all,” Sinkala said, calling that the hospital’s biggest worry.Zambia is one of the additional countries WHO planned to equip by the end of the week. As of Friday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Mike Ryan said 28 labs across the continent could diagnose the new virus.Adding to concerns at Sinozam, three employees say Zambian health officials visited on Tuesday and have been testing the bodies of two Chinese patients that have been in the morgue for days, though some added it was out of an overabundance of caution.Li, however, dismissed the accounts of testing the bodies as “rumors.” He said one died last month of malaria and the other of a heart attack. The bodies are still there because family members in China wish to come and pay respects but cannot because of the outbreak, he said.Zambia’s health ministry spokesman, Dr. Abel Kabalo, called the employee accounts of events at the hospital “very strange.” He vowed that if Zambia confirms a case, authorities “will definitely inform the world.”It’s “pointless to hide information,” Kabalo said.The WHO says countries are obligated to inform it of any confirmed cases and are requested to report suspected cases as well. The WHO chief has publicly urged countries to share information. So far, African countries appear to be complying, a WHO adviser on health security, Dr. Ambrose Talisuna, told reporters.Several African nations such as Ghana, South Africa and Ethiopia have announced their precautions, including updates on negative test results for suspected cases and demonstrations of surveillance and quarantine capabilities. Ethiopian Airlines, however, faces questions by some in Africa about why it continues to operate more than 30 China flights a week while other African airlines have suspended theirs.Adding to the difficulties in diagnosing the new virus are numerous diseases in Africa with symptoms that include fever or coughing or both.It’s impossible to diagnose the new virus by symptoms alone, Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said, adding that there is a “significant likelihood” that the virus will be confirmed in Africa. And there is a risk that “panic overtakes good public health and good science.”The foundation has committed up to $20 million to help health authorities in Africa and South Asia, another vulnerable region, improve their disease surveillance, isolation and treatment for the virus.Concerns are high among some in Kitwe. A local pharmacy manager, Edward Goma, estimated that his business had sold more than 800 face masks in the past few days.“So far everyone is scared,” he said. And yet he has not noticed the stricter surveillance measures seen in other countries, beyond temperature checks at the international airport an hour’s drive away.The 15th Metallurgical Construction Group, based in Wuhan, said on its website that its overseas operations in Zambia and Congo must purchase masks, disinfect living quarters and workspaces daily and check workers’ temperatures three times a day.Chinese employees are temporarily barred from returning to Africa, while those in Zambia are not allowed to go to China, said Li, the hospital administrator.Chinese embassies in Zambia and elsewhere in Africa have been unusually outspoken, giving news conferences and television interviews to discuss their response to the outbreak. Embassies require arriving Chinese citizens to declare where they have been in China. They also urge citizens to voluntarily isolate themselves for 14 days.“We are now practicing hygiene, even in the mines,” said the Kitwe-based president of the Mine Workers Union of Zambia, Joseph Chewe. “Any report of a person with coronavirus here will be very disastrous.”",Some (worrying) news out of Zambia - which has strong ties to China,2020-02-10 17:40:35,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f20x18/some_worrying_news_out_of_zambia_which_has_strong/

fha0a4b,0.9751,-0.8176,"I'm tracking in similar fashion. I think we need to separate out the stats from ""overwhelmed"" reporting areas (Hubei) since they have different constraints. Hubei stats are clearly test-capacity limited and not definitive.  Looking at China outside Hubei, case fatality rate (i.e., deaths / (deaths + recoveries) ) is 2.3-2.5%.  Inside Hubei it is almost certainly worse because hospital system is overwhelmed, but it's also impossible to tell because not all cases can be tested.The China confirmed-deaths number is particularly of interest because it is tracking a perfect parabolic curve, which is not the natural shape for an emerging epidemic. The parabolic curve predicts the following for the ""China - Deaths"" number in the next 7 WHO Situation Reports, beginning with Situation Report 22:1001, 1104, 1212, 1325, 1443, 1567, 1695The China confirmed cases number was also tracking this parabola, but has slowed recently. It's possible that test resources are being diverted away from confirming new cases in Hubei (which is likely pointless at this stage) and towards confirming recoveries. The latter would bring closure and allow key people (such as medical staff) to resume work with confidence of having immunity.The other number I am tracking is growth rate of confirmed cases outside of China.  Just take WHO or JHU numbers for today vs. 7 days ago.  The ratio has been steady at 2.0 to 2.2 for the past week (after the initial catch-up period).  So the number of confirmed cases is doubling every 7 days.

fhae22h,0.6187,0.0,Find a big micro allergen vacuum bag that can slide over the tower fan. Seal the bottom with tape and it turns into an air scrubber. $2-5 hack. Use all the material of the bag that you can to keep the CFM higher.  When the bag is on you won’t feel any or much air flow but it’s filtering the air. Humans breath about 8-15 liter per minute. A 200 CFM fan is moving 5663 liters per minute. 5563/15=370 so that means the filter on the fan could potentially capture 370 times more air than you. As long as you're next to it. It might capture 100 or more times the particles you do. Meaning you are lowering your exposure.,Respirators sold out?

fhait2e,-0.9715,0.0,"and it shouldn't be giving you one. It's fear mongering/bullshit.&#x200B;I [just flew back from China](https://imgur.com/a/2s7mRiz) (timestamped so no one discredits this)This video is full of shit - he will be contacted (like I was) by his local healthcare department, the same day of his landing (and I love how he left that part out) which will then come out to his house the following day - if he didn't answer that call, they'd still come out unannounced and ask questions and follow up with him throughout his 14-day quarantine. Yes, he's told to do a self-quarantine (because he wasn't in Wuhan/Hubei Province) as he passed screening questions. He left out that citizens have their temperatures checked, which he either left out because Dulles didn't have that setup (like he quite seriously states there's only 7 airports cleared for International flights) or he left out because he wanted to sensationalize more. To top that off, I witnessed two people pulled the line they put you in after disembarking the plane on the jet bridge (two lines - families and individual travelers) after the temperature check - which they were then escorted elsewhere (I'm guessing advanced screening) which is literally what the advanced screening is designed for - **people with symptoms, or those who have been to Hubei/Wuhan** and **those who have been around someone sick**. They don't care about how long these lines take, they don't care if you miss your connecting flight and they will say this to all passengers. They're making sure they miss **nothing** through screening.&#x200B;They are screening everyone. **US Citizens** can't even enter US Citizen lines to speed up their process - they're put in **Visa Holder** lines at the border, I even asked if I could enter the US Citizens line, they said no, they want to keep everyone safe. He's right though about one this though, no one beyond the CDC line was actually wearing a mask - which I think everyone should be required to wear one because these people see thousands of people a day, people who will then have continued/connecting domestic flights, so they should be required. I do agree on some parts of his video but for the most part, it's sensationalized and it's just a bunch of fear mongering bullshit for views and clickbait. He was screened and checked.&#x200B;Also, I love how people are downvoting u/nCovWatch, shills maybe?This is a YouTuber - his job is to make videos and make money off those videos, the more sensationalistic in nature the video, the more views he gets, and the more money he makes. Everything u/nCovWatch has said in his post was true - he was 100% contacted by his health department, of which, will reach out to him. I'm getting a visit tomorrow from mine, they're giving me a run down, they've called me each day since my arrival to check in on me and make sure that I'm taking precaution. The complaining and griping in this video is pure bullshit as his flight was redirected (travel ban **just went into effect**) so Dulles not being one of the **7 airports** with screening is the main cause of that - all flights through Air China have been reduced (3 a week compared to 2/day) and they're all directed to International hubs and airports cleared for screening. His experience is an anomaly and isn't what is standard, he should know this. He made this video for views and knew what he was doing when he made it. He was redirected to Dulles, they weren't equipped, travel ban just went into effect, they didn't have proper screening set up. Now that travel bans and restrictions are in place, they are doing as they said.&#x200B;His flight was **redirected to Dulles airport,** they **didn't even have a Chinese speaker/translator** and he even had to volunteer to help them out. **It was right after the flight restriction went into place** \- they **weren't prepared and other airports were probably exhausted in resources** (hence, only 3 flights allowed from China via Air China - they don't have enough resources to allow 2 flights/day)  **-** his situation is an anomaly. This dude is literally complaining about people in more dire situations in Wuhan in this video, about his paperwork, about pointless shit throughout this video like his inability to see his father (which he **knew full well** since he flew into Beijing on the 2nd - weeks after the virus started). How does he expect a proper screening when they don't **even have a translator**, and face masks when they **weren't expecting a Chinese** inbound flight? Like, what the fuck is he complaining about? This dude is just seeking views, since he hardly pulls over 100k on videos (he has a few) and he just wants to provoke interest and discussion, knowing full well why his situation was the way it was. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what he's doing here. He doesn't care about the accuracy of his video, he doesn't care if it spreads and misinforms people and is shared, all for more views, for his own personal gain. Then people eat this shit up like it's the reality of the situation.&#x200B;Which is just like half of the posts here on r/Coronavirus and r/China_Flu.&#x200B;Don't have a heart attack over this video.

That means the guy directly above him in the CCP ladder is senior. There's a great incentive to hide problems because if a lot of problems are coming from the area you are in charge of, it's assumed you are mismanaging your responsibilities. In turn, you wound the face of the person who got you into that position and trusted you with that duty. Further, all kinds of state-run media must be approved prior to publication.  The only reward for revealing problems is censorship and punishment, so officials would much rather hide problems than talk about them.  You are more likely to move up in the party if you consistently report few problems. The problem is this entire governmental structure.The Wuhan governor obviously is partially at fault, but not entirely. The central government is equally responsible.
