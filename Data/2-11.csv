fhb0mnx,-0.9502,0.0,"This will be a big issue as the virus uses the receptors in the intestines, lungs, and kidneys. and the plumbing and HVAC infrastructure (from my understanding) in China is in desperate need of inspections, repairs and upgrades. Likewise major cities in America also face this like NYC. The sewer system will be one of the things that spread coronavirus more along with hotel, apartment, and public restroom toilet plumes and all the fomites (sinks, handles or push plates on public restrooms and doors, menus in restaurants, the tabletop touch screen credit card/game machines at restaurants, credit card terminals (since people don't wash their hands properly). This doesn't include the jet hand dryers in bathrooms that aerosolize viruses and bacteria and blow them over 10 ft. from the unit. The HVAC or venting systems in buildings may not have HEPA filters (who knows if the makeshift hospitals that have been setup in China have HEPA filters) If a cluster develops in a nearby building around one of the makeshift hospitals that could be telling.Also take into account that a patient may not show symptoms for 14 days and then it is about 8-10 days until they show severe symptoms that would require seeking immediate medical attention During this time the virus is replicating and shedding. This means they can be potentially spreading the virus for up to 24 days before they are hospitalized. The 24 day incubation period was confirmed yesterday.

A SARS-infected Chinese doctor stayed at the Metropole Hong Kong hotel and had **diarrhea events in his bathroom located next to the room’s entry door.** Since his **room was positively pressurized to the hallway**, his **aerosolized SARS virions were pushed out into the hallway creating a SARS fecal cloud**. 15 guests and visitors **passed through his SARS fecal cloud** on the ninth-floor common area and **became infected**.”[https://www.esmagazine.com/articles/94845-solving-indoor-airborne-disease-transmission-problems](https://www.esmagazine.com/articles/94845-solving-indoor-airborne-disease-transmission-problems)[https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/panels/hs/papers/hs0423cb2-1824-1e.pdf](https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/panels/hs/papers/hs0423cb2-1824-1e.pdf)""**Sewage Disposal Systems and Spread of Contagions in an Apartment Complex**A study of a SARS outbreak in 2004 in an apartment complex documents the following process and findings Yu et al. also modeled the spread of aerosol in the Amoy Gardens housing complex during the outbreak, and their results similarly suggested **an aerosol pathway from the sewage disposal system through dry U-traps in bathroom floor drains induced by bathroom exhaust fans**, with **subsequent exhaust to the open air light well and transport between buildings**, and correlated these with the reporting of the first 187 SARS cases . These findings appear to provide the best explanation for the pattern of the initial 187 SARS cases in the Amoy Gardens apartments, and offer **strong support for a conclusion that airborne transmission was perhaps the primary mechanism for inter-apartment disease transmission during the initial phase of this outbreak**. Taken together, these studies suggest that SARS CoV **microbial droplet nuclei aerosols** produced from contaminated sewage and subsequently **transported on air currents may be highly infectious for significant periods and over long distances.**[https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/panels/hs/papers/hs0423cb2-1824-1e.pdf](https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/panels/hs/papers/hs0423cb2-1824-1e.pdf)[https://plumbingconnection.com.au/new-report-proves-plumbing-link-to-sars](https://plumbingconnection.com.au/new-report-proves-plumbing-link-to-sars/)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4692156/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4692156/)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29423191](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29423191)And then there is the fact that **vomit aersolization** can cover cover **83 square feet** and **toilet aerosolization** can cover **64 square feet** in **virus particlesSARS and NCoV-2019 bind to protein receptors in the lungs and intestines (ACE2)**""SARS and Wuhan viruses bind to the same distinctly shaped [protein receptors](https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/early/2020/01/23/JVI.00127-20.full.pdf) in the body that are expressed in the lungs and intestines, making these organs the primary targets for both viruses, said Fang Li, an associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at the University of Minnesota.""That has led to a run on face masks. But those may be of limited benefit in the event the virus is being transmitted via the fecal-oral route, said John Nicholls, a clinical professor of pathology at the University of Hong Kong.Squat latrines lacking covers, common in China, and hands that aren’t washed thoroughly with soap and water after visiting the bathroom could be a source of virus transmission, said Nicholls, who was part of the research team that isolated and characterized the SARS virus.“I think in Wuhan, that would be a very likely place where you might get the transmission” from fecal material, he said. “If it’s using the same receptor as for SARS, I can’t see why it shouldn’t be replicating in the gut.”Doctors have reported diarrhea infrequently in 2019-nCoV patients admitted to **Wuhan hospitals**, though it has been **more prominent among reported cases outside the city, including members of a Shenzhen family infected in Wuhan, and more recently in the first U.S. case in Washington state.**Many of the emerging coronaviruses are so-called pneumoenteric viruses, meaning they can **replicate both in the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal system,** said Ralph Baric, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has studied coronaviruses for decades.**Overwhelmed by hundreds of severely sick pneumonia patients, doctors in Wuhan might not have focused on any gastric signs**, Baric said in a phone interview.“The Chinese are so overwhelmed at the moment and trying to do a combination of treating patients and dealing with the scope of the outbreak, and then trying to get out papers that describe what’s happening,” he said.**Any virus in stool is more likely to be present during the acute phase of an infection, occurring before hospitalized patients develop a life-threatening complication known as acute respiratory distress syndrome,** Baric said.“I have also spent most of my time focusing on the respiratory tract symptomology rather than the gut because of the relationship between these different emerging viruses and acute respiratory distress syndrome,” he said.Zijian Feng, deputy director general of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and colleagues released a report Wednesday on the first 425 Wuhan cases, and noted that **early infections that didn’t appear to display typical signs — such as fever and viral pneumonia — or had mild symptoms might have been missed.**“The initial focus of case detection was on patients with pneumonia, but we now understand that some patients can present with gastrointestinal symptoms,” Feng and co-authors said in their report, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.”[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/02/asia-pacific/science-health-asia-pacific/coronavirus-feces-risk-of-spread/#.XjhjcC3MwSI](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/02/asia-pacific/science-health-asia-pacific/coronavirus-feces-risk-of-spread/#.XjhjcC3MwSI)",It's coming through the PIPES.

While some of the things you have said are true, R0 and T0 are time and context dependent.Once these viruses get past a certain stage they can persist in society by retransmission. If the bodies develop immunity then eventually they die out and are only sustained the sick(who's immunity is reduced to a point that the virus can take hold) and children who haven't been infected yet.The problem is that this virus was engineered to do exactly that. To have the right balance between R0 and T0 so that it infects at just the right rate and kills the right number to sustain itself so it infects everyone and kills everyone. I've never played plague inc but imagine it is like someone who was very good at the game and was able to develop the perfect virus to win. nCoV is not perfect, but it was designed with the intent. Zoological viruses don't work this way because as they evolve so does the population. It all balances out. Every once in a while it gets close and we end up with an outbreak. Bear in mind that all previous viruses were before ""modern"" science and globalism. There were far more sick people and less tools to help people recover. Spanish flu killed \~75M.Now we would expect nCoV not to be as bad because of the tech. To some degree it is true... but remember, it took weeks and months for people to transmit the virus(they couldn't transmit it faster than they could move and only horses  and boats existed)...

So it seems like they might have chosen that site because of the proximity to a lab and state health employees can easily stay close by in offices, have lab facilities. There is probably already 24/7 security at that site. North of that site is a residential habilitation facility, Fircrest, that’s like a boarding school for people with developmental disabilities. And East of the WA state lab is a dog park.

fhbn3kc,-0.6248,0.0,"Tom Cotton... you mean the man who just presided over a trial without evidence or witnesses?I would not take anything he says as anything.  ""Chinese biowarfare lab"" -> I presume he's referencing the BSL-4 lab in Wuhan.  But the 'biowarfare' is just slur and propaganda - since biowarfare is illegal, it's illegal for the BSL-4 lab to be such.  Now if it is or not doing 'biowarfare' experiments, that's a shocking reveal, but instead he drops, without proof, the casual comment, thus de-valuing the phrase 'biowarfare lab'. Y'all have played too much video games.  Biowarfare labs, if they exist, are highly secretive because they are highly illegal.  As in other countries may bomb them, or start a war to end them.  In fact, that was the (partial/entire) premise behind the Iraq War (part 1 & 2).Given how infectious the coronavirus is, my hypothesis is they were researching animal RNA viruses, similar to SARS, to develop treatments, and since it was likely in the BSL-3 area, some staffer slacked off once - didn't sanitize everything, didn't follow degowning procedures, whatever, and spread it from there.  Since the BSL-3 zones are so much less ""cool"" than the BSL-4 zone, staff carelessness or casualness is something easily conceivable. It's not that hard to imagine - you're working on the 'easy' side of the cool state-of-the-art internationally-built awesome BSL-4 and its like, ok whatever, I'm just in the '3' area, I want to get home sooner today, so maybe it'll be ok, we didn't even use that table over there.  I know procedures, but that'll take an extra 30 minutes to clean, but we only used 'this half' of the lab.We don't need 'biowarfare' arguments talking about this and that, when carelessness is right there, and much more likely.  Tom Cotton is doing that to speak to a certain portion of his base, and it's garbage talk from someone who knows better.

They are no longer counting people in China who they test positive with no symptoms although I would think that would be a smaller number because there are only so many kits. There are also only so many kits so people are dying and not getting counted which could drastically increase the current numbers.  At this point, it is just a hurry up and wait syndrome.  We (those of us that choose to) prepare as best we can and wait until we see something in our respective country as far as growth in cases or hopefully nothing.  There is also all the hush hush and the fact that it takes forever to get results on potential carriers even though we know it shouldn't.  That is disheartening but really I can't do much about that but try to keep up.  I think most of us here are somewhat prepared at least mentally and might be able to get a small head start if something does happen.In the end, you can only do so much.See your friends that you have not seen in a while, hug and kiss your loved ones.

fhcn7zb,0.9253,0.0,">Unfortunately, I think it’s more likely to be that it’s gathering steam. We’ve released a preprint that we’ve been discussing publicly — and trying to get peer reviewed in the meantime — that looks at the numbers internationally, based on how many cases you would expect from normal travel volumes. And a couple of things are striking. One is that there are countries that really should be finding cases and haven’t yet, like Indonesia and maybe Cambodia. They are outside the range of uncertainty you would expect even given variability between countries. So our best guess is that there are undetected cases in those countries. Indonesia said a couple of days ago that it had done 50 tests, but it has a lot of air travel with Wuhan, let alone the rest of China. So 50 tests is not enough to be confident you’re catching all the cases. That’s one bit of evidence that to me was really striking. Second, I was reading The Wall Street Journal that Singapore had three cases so far that were not traced to any other case. Singapore is the opposite of Indonesia, in that they have more cases than you would expect based on their travel volume, probably because they’re better at detection. And even they are finding cases that they don’t have a source for. That makes me think that many other places do as well. Of course, we’re making guesses from limited information, but I think they’re pretty likely to be correct guesses, given the totality of information.  >  >**There’s likely to be a period of widespread transmission in the U.S**., and I hope we will avert the kind of chaos that some other places are seeing. That’s likely if we continue to be prepared, but I think it’s going to be a new virus that we have to deal with. That won’t be because the United States government has failed to contain it, it will mean that this is an uncontainable virus. If we’re dealing with it, it’s because everybody’s going to be dealing with it. I think that’s a likely scenario.  >  >The evidence from other coronaviruses is that there is some immunity but it doesn’t last for long. Immunity to the seasonal coronaviruses lasts for maybe a couple of years, and then you can get reinfected. There’s a further question of whether that’s because the virus is changing or because your immunity is not very durable. Given that it’s a new virus, we can’t say anything with certainty, but it would be reasonable to expect immunity to be somewhat short-lived, meaning a couple of years, rather than lifelong.",Harvard expert says coronavirus likely now ‘gathering steam’,2020-02-11 15:52:26,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f2hm3b/harvard_expert_says_coronavirus_likely_now/

The quarantine official is being treated in the hospital.The new cases bring Japan's total to 203 people infected by the the new virus, COVID-19.The night of the ship's arrival, Japanese health officials began medical checks on all of the ship's 3,700 passengers and crew after one previous passenger tested positive for the virus.The U.S.-operated Diamond Princess had completed a 14-day tour during which it stopped at Hong Kong and several other Asian ports before returning to Japan. An 80-year-old man who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus, prompting Hong Kong to notify the ship and Japanese authorities, who then ordered the quarantine and testing.Concerns over the virus have rerouted and canceled other cruises. The Westerdam cruise ship carrying 2,257 passengers and crew is now in the Gulf of Thailand with nowhere to dock after being refused entry in Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand.

fhdi4ym,-0.9802,-0.3182,"I *would* seek help and report to the doctor if I thought I was exposed and infected, but honestly, there is no sense for anyone who isn’t more than mild-moderately ill to go to the doctor. Except, maybe if it’s been < 48hrs, you suspect it’s flu, and may benefit from tamiflu - but even then, it’s advisable to just call your primary care to request calling the prescription in for you without having to expose their whole clinic.  If I had CoVID-19, but didn’t feel like I need to be admitted to the hospital, then no one here in my area of California would even consider testing me for it anyway. Not unless I’m severely ill and required admission to the hospital. That’s the policy! We clarified this today in my clinic based on CDC and Public Health guidance. We would isolate the patient, call public health, they’d put them on a list and tell them to go home and isolate themselves, and come back (or go to the ER, really) if getting severe. Also, we couldn’t even order a single lab or rule out flu with a rapid test, because, if we *truly* suspect CoVID-19 enough to make them a “person under investigation” via Public Health, then our lab wants nothing to do with processing any of their specimens! So, at that point, we can’t test for CoVID-19, OR ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL!So... what’s the point?I expect this will change in the coming week or three with more testing accessibility, but last I heard, this was delayed in my area, perhaps until next week.  Until then, who really knows what’s going around, or why anyone would bother coming to the clinic if they suspect CoVID-2019. Just stay home and call Public Health to report yourself. No need to go to a clinic for that. Unless those symptoms are severe enough that you feel you need to be admitted to the hospital (and the ER doc agrees).^ pretty well sums up how a pandemic can potentially spread undetected for weeks.Edit: no, I don’t think this is going to destroy the country or wipe out 1/3 of Earth’s population or anything like that. I think it’s more contagious than we think, but also less deadly than we fear - on a population level. Vulnerable patients need to worry about CoVID-2019 as well as flu and any others floating around, but the general healthy public should probably be more worried about GIVING it to others than GETTING IT, at least until a safe and effective vaccine is developed or it dies out naturally. If you spread it with carelessness, you might have indirectly killed some kid with asthma, grandfather with heart disease, neighbor on immune suppressing medications, etc... so be careful, and if you’re mildly sick, don’t be an asshole about it./rant","I have to admit, I have been thinking about this virus all wrong.

Countless lives are going to be destroyed because government leaders can't overcome their hubris long enough to look at the human cost of their decisions. I do not believe that there is some coordination to keep us all in the dark to keep the economy afloat, but I do believe in human idiocy making this worse.The news has been really strangely coded these past few days. There are huge events happening, but you have to specifically seek them out in a way that I can't recall ever having to do in the past decade or so. None of my co-workers know that there are other cruise ships besides the one in Japan, for example. none of my co-workers know about the two hundred people in Georgia, or the people in Troy, New York. Yet, a Google search yields does yield results a few scrolls down the page. It's not suppressed, but...muffled by incompetency? perhaps there's so much news about the coronavirus that news agencies are not quite sure how to run with it?And then there are those weird conferences that the WHO is giving. Tedros Adhanom is speaking out of both sides of his mouth sometimes. It is both simultaneously a thing that requires swift action, but also something that is not a major cause for concern? It was not a major emergency before, but now time is of the essence? it's almost as though they are purposefully trying to confuse people, or perhaps their messaging is so poor internally that they are having difficulties coordinating.At the same time, life is going to go on whether or not something is done. Do I think it will get worse in the United States? Absolutely. A lot of people are going to get sick. Do I think it's going to get worse in Europe? Sure. There are a lot of things that we are not being told and that are being hidden from us.For what it's worth, this probably did come from that bio research facility in Wuhan. It's probably not a bio-weapon though; it is more than likely some research strain that was meant to be a precursor to a vaccine for SARS.

All medicines have the possibility of adverse side effects, but sometimes, the risk is deemed worth the potential reward.  Just as it would be unwise to recommend heart surgery for a person without heart problems, so also it would be unwise to suggest that someone take an antiviral substance if they have no virus.But, if you are seeking to merely stock up on something just in case the day ever comes that you are faced with the situation of having contracted a potentially lethal virus...and are without the option of seeking professional medical assistance...and you have to just take your best shot on your own to save your own life....then consider the following:**[BHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butylated_hydroxytoluene)** Butylated hydroxytoluene is a powerful antiviral.

As SOON as you start to feel symptoms take ADVIL. Advil's generic name is ibuprofen.The reason you want to take this anti inflammatory is so your lungs don't get inflamed because it's harder to get the lungs uninflamed, once they are allowed to get inflamed. That's the importance of taking anti-inflammatory drugs right away.I would see your GP RIGHT away to notify her/him that you are ill and give a history for statistics. Let them know if you have traveled and so on.Your GP might also give you a steroidal and/or a bronchodilator inhaler. It's important you take these medicines on time and accurately.Your doctor will probably want to measure your O2 in your blood. Most GP's have the machine. It's that red laser thing that goes on your finger to see the saturation of oxygen in your blood. If you're wearing fingernail polish, TAKE IT OFF before you see the GP.Also, if you start getting worse, your doctor can do bloodwork.I think for me, if I get sick, I'll see my GP and try to fight it at home before I step foot in a hospital. It's so depressing in there anyway. Who wants to sit in a hospital with a bunch of germs and staph? Not me.One of the reasons I had pneumonia as a person in my early 20's was because I didn't see a GP right away and did NONE of the above. It was only after that I learned these things and I live in a country now with single payer healthcare whereas I had the pneumonia in the USA, the absolute worst place to be sick if you're not a rich person.&#x200B;Edit: I see some ppl recommending guaifenisen.
