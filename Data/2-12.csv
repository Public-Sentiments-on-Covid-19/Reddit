The problem is that they over generalize. Since, come on, we also know there is a huge trend for people to self-diagnose, too. I mean, I have encountered more people who claim to have a dated a sociopath or a narcissist, as if it was something to be proud of. As if they could diagnose someone. The other issue I see is based to where they stand in society. We would look weird if a cop started to act like a coward. In the same token, Doctors also are aware that they have to retain a certain aspect of stoicism, if not due to their education, then to their position in society and lastly, because it is implied in their job role. So, they are more likely to remain skeptical. I mean, look at Reddit here, there are people who are claiming to be getting anxious and depressed over the Corona Virus, or of reading the news. That is not very rational either. This is not to take away from your point. I have a number of friends who are doctors and alas for one, I have not even talked to them about it, as I already half expect for one of them to look at me funny for being aware of shit before they are.  There is also the fact that the Corona Virus is new. Look, our grandparents lived in a time of Polio, Malaria, Influenza, just to name a few, and they would just come in and cripple you or kill you.   Most of us --except for people in the 3rd world-- have not been raised to know how to handle this. Most people have apocalyptic movies and the Walking Dead to go by. No one wants to act like any of those characters so again, they will keep it on the down low publicly until the very last moment. The one Doctor friend I have spoken to, has told me in private that is scared. Since she works at a hospital and she sees people day in and day out. We only have a handful of cases in our city and statistically the risk is very, very low. But at least she is admitting to act human but at her job? Nothing of it shows, because she can't allow it to, otherwise, she would not be doing the best possible job. Which I think is part of the reason you feel that way.

If it’s a worse case scenario and the virus spreads uncontrollably across the globe, infecting 60-80% of the world’s population with a case mortality rate of 2-3%, it would result in between 100 to 175 million deaths.

I’d be much more concerned for older family members than I am for myself. That being said, I believe the repercussions that this worst case scenario would have on society would be devastating. Modern global society is much more interconnected and interdependent than it was during the time of the Spanish Flu. The impacts on the economy, social structures, and institutions would probably have longer lasting effects than the virus itself.

fheh4lk,0.9497,0.0,"This is AI at work.  The algorithm farms out the DNA sequence analysis into what I assume would be nvidia cloud compute, where it can leverage massive CPU power to run millions of simulations.  They model how to make the immune system identify the virus so it can be destroyed by using both active (live) recombinant virus  forms or deactivated (dead) forms.  Deactivated virus as a vaccine is rarely viable (or so I've read).  For active forms, to generate the vaccine, you literally chop out the deadly part while leaving the main viral function intact, essentially genetically engineering a new virus.  It's a tricky thing, with the potential for mutation and reversion if the new virus hops to another host.  You could, hypothetically, create something worse.Of course, this is extremely simplified, and this is not my field of expertise.  There are several public papers on the coronavirus vaccine approaches.  I've linked one below, but it's not a quick read.  The gist is that they can use an active neutered coronavirus carrier recombinant with specific sequences from a specific outbreak virus to quickly create a vaccine.  While this lab in the news story doesn't publish their approach (from what I can find) I would strongly suspect this is what they've refined:[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0175-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0175-7)The challenge appears to be merging lab-modified carrier with the wild virus to produce a viable stable active bug that doesn't mutate.

fheh2f4,0.1027,0.0,">SAN DIEGO — In a race against the clock, a San Diego lab is scrambling to get a COVID-19 vaccine out and on the market. As the days go by, Inovio Pharmaceuticals is getting closer to releasing the desperately needed vaccine against the deadly virus. Inovio Pharmaceuticals, which is located in Sorrento Valley, has also created a vaccine for the Zika virus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the vaccine for Ebola. Dr. Trevor Smith, who is the director of research and development at Inovio, said, ""It's something we are trained to do, and the infrastructure is here and the expertise is in house."" When Chinese scientists released the genetic sequence on Jan. 9, Inovio researchers got to work immediately and within 3 hours they had a vaccine for coronavirus, or COVID-19 as it is now being referred to. ""We have an algorithm which we designed, and we put the DNA sequence into our algorithm and came up with the vaccine in that short amount of time,"" said Dr. Smith. Tens of thousands in China have been quarantined and continue to suffer from the virus. That’s why scientists at Inovio Pharmaceuticals say they feel the sense of urgency to get the vaccine out.  The vaccine has been tested on mice and guinea pigs. It will next be tried on a group of human patients. Scientists hope the vaccine will work like a piece of biological software. In other words, the vaccine will give the human body instructions to create the proper attack in the form of T-cells and antibodies against COVID-19. If all goes as planned, the vaccine could be made available to the public by early this summer - which would be a record time frame for Inovio Pharmaceuticals. Currently, an Inovio Pharmaceuticals lead researcher is in Sweden meeting with the World Health Organization to come up with the best plan of attack against COVID-19.",Is this real?

January 28th is when the final lockdown went into effect.  ""Lunar New Year is the largest annual human migration, with Chinese citizens making a combined 3 billon trips during the season.

This means they could potentially be spreading it for 22 - 24 days. What is not clear is if they are saying 24 days until symptoms begin. If so then add another potential 8 - 10 days before the symptoms are so severe someone would seek medical attention.  They seem to be now backtracking on the 24 days. I don't know why they would put it in a research article if it was insignificant as the researchers now seem to be downplaying it. I personally would err to the side of caution.[https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-11/coronavirus-study-finds-incubation-period-of-up-to-24-days-101513859.html](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-11/coronavirus-study-finds-incubation-period-of-up-to-24-days-101513859.html)CDC is still using the 14 day incubation period and clearing anyone that has not come down sick in 14 days.

Already we've been told that if you think you have COVID then you do not go to a hospital. In the U.K people have been instructed to stay at home and phone 111.The general plan for a dangerous epidemic in the U.K is that you quarantine yourself and get a code for a test kit which someone else picks up and puts through your letterbox and then test yourself. People who become severely ill will be picked up and taken to a quarantine for care.The NHS day-to-day is really a separate thing. Some staff will be drained from it to help with COVID outbreak if it becomes widespread, but what needs to be mobilised for dealing with COVID will be done so. People severely misunderstand the issues with the NHS and its day-to-day problems, which is primarily problems with inefficiency and resource-management.

fhfc8pz,-0.9266,-0.1217,"I can answer this with some degree of inside knowledge, with a sister who is a GP, and  myself working in orthopaedics within the NHS. The NHS IS underprepared for this, but with a caveat. The flu generally clogs up the majority of hospitals, particularly in the north, every year, without fail. The result of this is that elective surgeries are cancelled to free up beds and isolation wards. Add another huge burden onto this, then yes, there will be trouble.The caveat is that this influx of inpatients declines very quickly after March, so I would say that the NHS is underprepared for a few months. Now, I have been speaking with colleagues in the last week or so, and what I would suggest is that people don’t panic. I’m all for information sharing, but I do believe that this sub is getting somewhat extreme; as it stands, we don’t know how widespread this is or will be yet. We’ve reacted much faster than China with regards to quarantining, meaning this *should* slow the spread at least. In which case, assuming the winter measures caused by flu are behind us, then we *may* be equipped to deal with this from an NHS perspective.

They have a lot of extra time.Will the NHS and other governments make good use of this time. I hope so. Handing out pamphlets at the airport and asking people to self quarantine was too weak.

Do you ACTUALLY believe this? Look at all the largest economic depressions and recessions in world history. All of the largest ones have affected the entire world economy. Economies all work together. When one goes down, other feel the impact of that in some way shape or form, and for a country as big as China the whole world will feel that impact. We won't be as hard hit as China, but we will feel it to some extentAnd the rest of the world being in a recession doesn't help China one bit lmfao. Stop with that bullshit. If other countries are operating mostly as normal, with the exception of most Chinese goods, then at least there is still investment in the Chinese economy.

fhfcwns,-0.9186,0.0,"""Some of the coronavirus testing kits sent to states and to at least 30 other countries have flaws and do not work properly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.The kits were meant to enable states to conduct their own testing and get results faster than they would by shipping samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta. But the failure of the kits means that states still have to depend on the C.D.C., which will mean several days’ delay in getting results.The C.D.C. announced last week that it had begun shipping about 200 kits to laboratories in the United States and roughly 200 more to labs in more than 30 other countries. Each kit can test about 700 to 800 specimens from patients, the agency said.Officials have not said how many of the kits are flawed.On trial runs in some states, the kits produced results that were “inconclusive,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news conference on Wednesday.“Things may not always go as smoothly as we may like,” Dr. Messonnier said.She said the C.D.C. was working closely with the states, and would send out new ingredients to laboratories that have encountered the problem.There have been 13 confirmed cases of the infection in patients in the United States so far. About 850 evacuees have been quarantined at military bases after returning from China. Still others are under self-quarantine at their homes.The flawed test kits are a separate issue from the mislabeled samples in San Diego that led officials to discharge from the hospital a woman who was sick from the coronavirus.More than 1,100 people have died, nearly all of them in China, where there are more than 44,000 confirmed cases.""(I blocked their script and copy pasted)","“Coronavirus Test Kits Sent to States, 30 Countries Are Flawed, C.D.C.

People have bumper stickers on their cars, or fly military flags in their front yards. We even have people here (U.S.) who pretend to be soldiers to get the attention and praise reserved for veterans.Healthcare workers, especially nurses, doctors, EMTs, surgeons, and researchers, are also soldiers. Their war is against illness. Their purpose is to go into battle every day. The only difference is that instead of picking up a rifle, the doctor picks up a scalpel. The researcher picks up a pipette. The nurse picks up medication. Both soldiers and medical professionals face their enemy with the same determination and grit. Most of the time we wish that the healthcare worker is victorious. Most of the time, they are. The loser is the virus, or the illness. Instead of an armistice, we have a vaccine, or a healthy person.As long as humans are on this planet, there will be war between different nations.

Governments and the private sector should assign a greater priority to developing methods to combat mis- and disinformation prior to the next pandemic response. Governments will need to partner with traditional and social media companies to research and develop nimble approaches to countering misinformation. This will require developing the ability to flood media with fast, accurate, and consistent information. Public health authorities should work with private employers and trusted community leaders such as faith leaders, to promulgate factual information to employees and citizens. Trusted, influential private-sector employers should create the capacity to readily and reliably augment public messaging, manage rumors and misinformation, and amplify credible information to support emergency public communications. National public health agencies should work in close collaboration with WHO to create the capability to rapidly develop and release consistent health messages.

fhgv0kc,0.3429,0.5574,"Based on the findings so far, it's interesting that the GGO is found peripherally in lungs. As I am not a virologist nor a pulmonologist, maybe it isn't that interesting. Based on what I have read and seen in the sources in the OP and online along with viral pathogenesis and immunology research, I would think that the virus generally infects the lungs in the alveoli of the smallest bronchiols as its small size allows it to travel to deep lung tissue uninhibited. Perhaps there is less of an overwhelming immune response in these alveoli as compared to viral infection occurring in the epithelial cells along a major bronchiol wall. Alveoli should fill up quickly with fluid as the virus replicates and cells die or macrophages, T cells, NK cells, and others congregate to deal with the localized infection. At this point, the body should be able to cough up this exudate/transudate and improve breathing. This is not happening so easily in COVID infections. The virus may be able to inhibit certain immune factors thus preventing aggregated mucus from being cleared from the airways but still effectively reduce gas exchange across capillaries (pertains to symptoms of difficulty breathing but no increase in sputum that restores breathing). Perhaps alveolar collapse is occurring due to very small, localized virulence destroying the epithelial cells in those areas preventing the alveoli from inflating thus preventing the removal of mucus. As the virus is very contagious but so far determined that it is not very virulent (compared to other high-mortality viruses), perhaps there is an underlying factor that we are not yet aware of that allows for better replication but less overall tissue death unless an underlying condition is present.The noted worsening condition of patients after initial improvement may be due to the virus replicating enough to outnumber the immune cells and pass into the bloodstream through the capillaries. If this occurs, it takes less than a day to infect major organs that each have their own immune response (liver, kidneys, heart, etc). Treatment then requires ICU to address a wider spread of the virus in vital organs. A patient then also has a higher viral load, increased viral shedding, and obvious increased chance of death. I have also read that cytokine storm syndrome can largely be the body's response to mass viral infection effectively killing a patient before the virus does (this was commonly noticed in H1N1 patients). https://www.ajronline.org/doi/full/10.2214/ajr.184.2.01840613https://www.newswise.com/articles/here-s-a-playbook-for-stopping-deadly-cytokine-storm-syndrome",Actual positive news regarding diagnosis/screening via CT,2020-02-12 18:52:09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f3340d/actual_positive_news_regarding_diagnosisscreening/

Also, five gallon buckets work wonders as water storage should the need arise, simply place them in your bathtub and fill them up and store them in the tub to avoid spillage and leaks. Make sure to have a small folding solar panel ($50 online) to charge your cell phone. I'd recommend taking pictures of important documents (lease/mortgage, car title, etc) so they're stored on your phone as backup. Also take this time to consolidate your important documents into one container that is preferably water/fire resistant in case you have to leave in a hurry. Having a few hundred dollars in cash of various denominations is ideal too. Sorry, it's late and I'm typing from my phone but I hope that gives you a general idea. You're on the right path with what you've posted. Don't get caught up in the go live in the woods fantasy of prepping, think about your daily needs (phone access, food, medicine, money).",Thoughts/suggestions on my supplies?,2020-02-12 21:35:29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f355ub/thoughtssuggestions_on_my_supplies/

fhgphs3,0.972,0.0,"Someone posted this a few days ago...Requirements for Chinese factories to re-open, and why the shortage will continue:1. Strict hygiene upkeep for dorm and quarantine measurements. If your factory does not have a dorm then you have to show how you can provide quarantine measurements for all employees which basically means you don’t get approval. Luckily only 1 of our factories does not have dorms so we are looking to see if renting out a hotel will suffice. Not sure but worth a try 2. Enough face mask on hand for each employee to have. Face mask are to be changed every 4 hours. Due to face mask and labor shortage we are looking to do skeleton crew openings. This also limits our companies exposure to liability. Less people less chance of outbreak in the factory.  3. All workers returning from outside the city are to be quarantined for 14 days...really interested to see how long this last. This would mean that most factories would be operating at below 20 maybe 50% capacity if lucky. For our case we will be around 10-15% capacity. Really light but we would rather have it this way honestly. Good news is this the strictest we have seen China on regulation. Everyone has heard of the red envelope stories and this situation is different. No red envelopes are gonna get you open this time. You have to pass the inspections the right way which is positive (at least that is what we have observed from our experience). All that being said our company feels forced to open immediately due to our end customers CMs (contract manufactures) getting early approval to open. Not going to call these CMs out but most people familiar with Asia manufacturing will know. Since most of the big CMs gained approval it has put pressure on us to move forward with opening even though we are not 100% comfortable.

fhj76wb,-0.1623,0.3612,"Markets are still high because of the ""flight to safety"" from Chinese (and now European) stocks, as well as travel, energy, and commodity stocks. US stocks are seen as the safest, but I think it's myopic to only look at the S&P when more and more international stocks, starting in Asia, are falling. I'm also concerned about China's debt, both its government's already massive debt, as well as the unregulated ""shadow banking"" that may affect the small companies that will be the first to go under if (and when) China has an extended economic impact. In the short-term, Trump's tariff wars sorta blunted investment in China before the epidemic.That being said, as someone who's retired, I'm following a Dividend Growth Investing strategy, and the companies in this strategy tend to be, at most, international ones in their exposure to China and other markets. Many of these companies have lived through more than one recession, as well as SARS. I don't have the motivation anymore to follow tech stocks (in my days, tech was operating systems, not social anything), and never had it for international stocks -- and this epidemic isn't encouraging me to start. Buffet said to invest only in what you understand, and I believe you can make money if you miss out on most ""successful"" stocks. (I bought MSFT in the 1990's.)Ken Fisher said, before the epidemic, that we're in the last third of a bull market. That's when the last of the individual investors (newbies and reluctant investors) put their money into the market, into familiar companies -- in other words, large caps. But, at the same time, he says to expect corrections, which are sharp drops in the market, during a bull run. We've had one several days ago. Hope investors remember it. Fisher also quotes Templeton, who said,  ""Bull markets are born on pessimism, grown on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria."" ""Flight to safety"" isn't exactly euphoria, but I'm not finding a Templeton quote about it.",Financial markets are banking on the economy recovering quickly and completely as soon as the virus peaks like SARS or Ebola...but models aren't accounting for some key info they don't have.

fhhr5m4,0.7664,0.1779,"There's a few problems with this.First, you can typically stack 2-3 years of food just from the grocery store. Dates on many things will last that long and are good past their 'best buy' dates. If you're looking for a month or even 6+ month quarantine, growing your own food isn't the answer.Second, think of climates. Here where I'm at, November-April you basically can't grow anything. That's a large portion of the year. You'd have to have a green house and electricity/heating to support it. Cost-wise, it would be better to stock up on grocery food.Third, you need space and a lot of plants. A balcony apartment garden isn't going to net you the daily food you need or even really supplement it much. Most suburban 1/4"" acre or smaller backyards aren't going to be big enough. Not to mention the water you'd need for them, especially if it got to the point in which running water was an issue.Fourth, and probably most importantly, gardening even on a small scale is a skill that's learned over time. We're talking years. It's not something you put away seed for 'when the time comes'. It takes seasons/years to get the land and ground where it needs to be. It also takes trial and error in watering, protecting, and other aspects of gardening. For most people, you'd need 2-3 years experience or more.If you're looking to prep and stock up, having the food available in your pantry or basement is much more practical, cheaper, and easier to maintain. With most prepping that includes civil unrest, financial collapse, natural disasters, etc I'd take even a full year of food stored over growing it. If things go much more than even a few months of zero food available, 95% of the population will be in dire straights anyways.On a positive note, it's not a bad skill to have an can supplement your stored food. I'm not totally against it, but I don't think it's practical as a main source of food.","Prepare long term - growing plants, stacking seeds",2020-02-12 23:59:13,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f36ono/prepare_long_term_growing_plants_stacking_seeds/

fhhd341,0.9609,0.1779,"There aren't a lot of calories in any of these, but they're still worth growing for nutrients and fiber and variety in your diet.My suggestions, for reliable and efficient production of veggies:\-- For a quick and tasty crop, I also agree with radishes. If you don't like the taste, the spicy goes away if they're cooked and they can be treated like a somewhat watery turnip.\-- Beets, which can be planted as soon as the ground can be worked if you're in an area with frozen ground. Or year 'round in some places.\-- Swiss chard, for a summer leaf crop that's more reliable than spinach or lettuce\-- Carrots -- I like royal chantenay, for jumbo sized carrots that keep well. Plant them in early summer, and harvest from early fall right through the winter.\-- Zucchini, as soon as all threat of frost is past. Let the zukes get big (forearm sized) and they're not quite as tasty but they'll keep a lot longer. They can also be sliced and dried and then added to soups and stews later. Smaller ones (before the seeds get big) can be pickled and will be pretty close to cucumber pickles in taste. If you have a whole bunch of zukes that are bigger, you can scoop the seeds out and peel them and pickle the meat, but the results aren't quite as good. (Plant LOTS of zucchini. The plants are incredibly prolific, but you'll lose some -- one plant can feed a family, but it sucks if that one plant dies because squash borers happen. I'd plant six to eight plants for a family, preserve as much as I could for later, and then give away the rest.) \-- On cucumbers, be sure you buy disease resistant varieties. Look for the label VFN on the package.\-- Roma, Early Girl and Sweet 100 cherry tomatoes have always been the most reliable for me, with the biggest crops. Romas and Early Girls both produce big crops all at once, so plan on canning, drying or freezing them for use in cooking. Sweet 100's are just plain prolific and will keep producing until the first hard frost in most areas. Then come back from seed (possibly not breeding true, but close) the next year in the same bed.\-- Butternut or Spaghetti squash will keep for months (I've had them last a year plus)  if harvested after the vines start to die back.\-- It's too late for this year, but garlic can be planted in the early fall, then harvested in early summer, and the same bed used for a quick warm-season crop like beans, edamame or cucumbers. Replant with garlic in the fall.\-- Onions have always been hit or miss for me, but even if they don't make big bulbs, the leaves are edible.\-- For green beans, if you grow them, plan on harvesting them ever other day when they start setting. Better to pick them early than let them get stringy. If you plant more than a few plants you're likely to have a LOT of beans, so think ahead on how you'll preserve them. You can either freeze them, or can them. Canning beans requires a pressure canner and attention to detail. \*Pickled\* beans do not require pressure canning, and are usually what I do with the excess.If you're growing grops because of food shortages, or more likely lack of variety in the grocery stores or inability to get there (which is what I'm concerned about if this develops into a quarantine scenario) you want to focus on the most reliable. Read up on disease resistance, talk to experts about what works best in your area, plant more than you think you'll need (because some plants will die, and worst case you'll have enough to share), be sure to buy some effective pesticides, spend the money on fertilizer, and be practical.I like to experiment with heirloom varieties and cool exotics. This would be a year to grow trust-worthy hybrids that are disease resistant, prolific, with proven traits. It's also not a year to experiment with organic pest control, for example, when the white flies or the squash beetles hit. (When the squash beetles show up this year, I'd absolutely break out the sevin. Not organic, frowned upon because it kills good insects, and I guarantee somebody will downvote me for saying this, but ... if this is a garden I'm actually \*counting\* on rather than a hobby? I'm using what I 100% know will work rather than mucking around with traps and predatory insects and hand picking. The stakes would be too high if this evolves into an actual situation of shortages and quarantines in the US.)","Prepare long term - growing plants, stacking seeds",2020-02-12 23:59:13,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f36ono/prepare_long_term_growing_plants_stacking_seeds/
