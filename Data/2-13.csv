fhh0r0c,-0.968,0.0,"Full Text :Criticism over inadequate protection for medical personnel followed reports Wednesday that a quarantine officer who screened people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Yokohama tested positive for COVID-19.Experts are also speculating that the protective gear worn by the officer was insufficient.Officials from the health ministry have said it was essential to check whether protective measures by medical personnel against the virus are sufficient.“We’d like to promptly evaluate whether (the infected officer) was adequately protected or not but at this point I can’t give further comments,” a senior official told reporters Wednesday.According to the health ministry, the officer was dispatched to collect health questionnaires from passengers on Feb. 3 and Feb. 4 and to check their temperature. The officer spent the next two days working at a quarantine station and started to feel ill Sunday. He went to a clinic the following day and tested positive Tuesday.The man claims that he was wearing a surgical mask and gloves while on board the ship, following World Health Organization standards. He also washed his hands frequently but didn’t wear goggles to shield his eyes.“Health authorities in China have raised alarm over risks that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted through the eyes,” stressed Masaya Yamato, director of the Infectious Diseases Center at Osaka-based Rinku General Medical Center. “Even if the officer was just collecting survey responses, he should have worn goggles.”Emiko Iwasaki, a former director of the health ministry’s quarantine station in Sendai who was in charge of Japan’s measures against the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Africa, points to health workers’ vulnerability to the virus.“Fatigue accumulation causes immune dysfunction,” Iwasaki said. “The worker may have contracted the virus after touching his nose or mouth if he had touched walls or handrails or gloves he used on the ship.”Nevertheless, Iwasaki believes the officer’s role in further spreading the virus wasn’t significant.“The number of viral particles in the human body immediately after transmission is relatively low,” she said.However, Moriyo Kimura, who used to work at the health ministry’s quarantine station, warned of an infectious risk.Such close contact with people infected with the virus is not envisaged in the job description of a quarantine officer. Considering this point, “this virus must be of a very high infectivity,” she said.“Many people visit quarantine stations including those who come to perform export or import inspections or to get a vaccination shot. We need to consider the possibility that the virus may have spread outside the ship and may have been transmitted to the officer’s family members or his co-workers.”Of the 174 infected onboard the Diamond Princess, 20 are crew members. These include restaurant and bar staff, those responsible for cleaning guests’ rooms, and some were sharing rooms with other crew members. Because quarantine inspectors and crew are in constant contact with passengers, there’s a possibility this frequent contact has become one of the infection routes.“Even if passengers stay in their rooms, every day crew members and quarantine officers are coming in and out. If they are infected, they may spread the virus to the passengers,” stressed another former quarantine station chief. The official has gone through a quarantine drill for handling H1N1 influenza on a large cruise ship with more than 3,000 passengers.“It’s likely that no one had envisioned a scenario in which one infected person after another would be taken from their rooms and hospitalized,” the official said.Although a passenger from Hong Kong who disembarked in January was found to be infected Feb. 1, it is believed that passengers were able to move freely within the ship, and social events were still open, until they were requested to stay in their rooms Feb. 5.“It is natural to think that the virus spread during the period in which recreational events were taking place there, while the symptoms started showing after the incubation period,” said Yoshiaki Katsuda, a professor at Kansai University of Social Welfare who specializes in travel medicine.The point is how the situation will turn out after the general incubation period of 12½ days, counting from Feb. 5 when health officials applied full-scale containment measures.“If the virus spreads further, we need to think about other transmission routes, making the situation more serious,” Katsuda said.He emphasized that “it is essential to review what kind of work infected crew members were doing, the level of physical contact with passengers and whether infection safeguards were thoroughly enforced.”",Questions raised over protective gear as Japan quarantine officer gets COVID-19,2020-02-13 02:04:35,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f37tlm/questions_raised_over_protective_gear_as_japan/

The only ones who are certain 100% about things atm are conspiracy theorists and ignorant uneducated people who know nothing about virology. Before this outbreak I was only familiar with the feline coronavirus since I reascue cats and have 5 at home. It's a mystery virus to this day. For some yet unknown reason despite research it can mutate throughout the cat's life and cause FiP, a disease that destroys the gastrointestinal tract and has 100% mortality. There's no concrete answer why despite years of research. One of the guesses is it has something to with genetics specifically in the cat for this mutation to work and siamese cats are more prone to it. Even in it's non mutated form symptoms can vary greatly. Some cats never have any or just mild diarrhea. Asymptomatic shedding is common and easy. Some cats get really ill from it. It's a virus that's all over the place. There's no official cure though last year I think trials were made and had good results though no long term information yet. Coronavirus family are single stranded RNA viruses. I think those are the most rapidly mutating virus types so who knows what direction they will take. We will probably need at least 2 years to do anything about this thing. If the virus varies greatly from individual to individual like in cats then it's probably going to make finding a general cure that works on everyone harder.

fhhlpxz,-0.9946,-0.2263,"> What is the incubation period?Three days on average, but at least up to fourteen days.> Is asymptomatic transmission possible?Yes!> Where did this originate from?Bats as usual. The amount of bat species in the world is the largest among mammals, comprising of at least 20% of all mammal species, so they naturally hold the world's most viruses that could infect human beings.Since bat viruses seem to have trouble jumping to humans directly, but easily can jump from one mammal to another, there's an intermediate species. The specific bat species appears to be recently known by the CCP, but kept secret to the public, likely to keep people away from doing something stupid like burning down bat caves.  This intermediate species is speculated to be a Pangolin.  So the most plausible thing that happened is that a rich Chinese businessman/woman decided to eat Pangolin in Wuhan, got a minor flu, got better, infected others during this period, and later strolled down the wet market, infecting more people. It's this, or it was created in a secret new lab in Wuhan where they research the most dangerous viruses in the world and decided to create a completely new virus of which they have no vaccine to instead of trying to create vaccines for existing diseases in which case you have it and the enemy doesn't, but I'm no longer holding my breath for this second explanation.> What to prepare for?If you're under 30, avoiding a flu.  If you're between 30-60, avoiding a nasty flu that could lead to pneumonia  If you're between 60-80, avoiding pneumonia that could lead to death  If you're over 80, avoiding death.  Overcrowded hospitals with many elderly not getting the care they need because the hospitals have run out of medical equipment.  You should prepare for not getting the elderly sick by washing your hands regularly and wear a mask to slow down the spread as much as possible, so hospitals won't get too overcrowded.  Other than that, keep on working.  > Anyways, it seems like everyday the narrative changes.You'll have to explain this, because so far I've not seen the narrative change other than additional information and forgoing prooftesting to add in the number of highly suspected cases as the number of infected is becoming more important than getting a precise mortality rate.","Have you ever stopped and asked yourself, why don't we have any answers?",2020-02-13 02:20:21,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f37yyh/have_you_ever_stopped_and_asked_yourself_why_dont/

The #1 way you spread viruses is through coughing and sneezing, specifically into your hands, where you then touch surfaces. But again, its still technically possible. But the two major studies we had on asymptomatic infection... it turned out the infected were not asymptomatic, they had symptoms. Other than that, we are still trying to calculate the R0 rate, which there seems to be a new study every hour on, giving ranges which vary from 1.3 to 7. This was similar to SARS, where the R0 rate varied wildly and the media mostly only picked up on the studies which gave it the highest R0 rate.

fhh9sjs,0.9167,0.0,"A lot of ppl have mentioned masks, sanitisers etc, which is good. I’ll add on random thoughts here and there. you can look into getting safety goggles and disposable elastic gloves too. I’m even getting ear plugs. In the event that things are getting really bad and you need to go out, moreover to high-risk places like clinics for your check up, wear to further reduce exposure.  I also bought some medical tape. I haven’t tried it yet but I’m going to tape my mask to my face to prevent any openings should I travel to high-risk places. I also place a bottle of sanitiser outside my house, and I sanitise before entering, the proceed to wash my hand.Cut your nails, they breed germs. I have a ring that never leaves my side, but I’ve taken it off temporarily as its design makes it difficult to clean daily. Remember to sanitise your phone regularly! Also wipe down your couch and dining seats etc with dettol, but try to get someone else to do it to reduce your exposure with this germ-killing vapours. I’ll really recommend stocking up on dettol, they can be used as a disinfectant to a antiseptic wipe for wounds. (Remember to dilute as per instructions for different usage). If you’re open to it, look into frozen meat and veggies, so you can buy more per time and reduce going outdoors. I’m in Asia, so we stock up on rice. Not sure what’s your diet like, but rice is a good stock up choice as it can last for a very long time (if you don’t break the seal), fills you, and versatile. If you buy pasta, buy different types so you can at least a change of texture. I’ve bought dried seaweed too, which will be an emergency’s choice for veggy intake. While supplies in marts might be relaxed now, be prepared for possibility of panic buying. Don’t forget to store water! If anything, get Tesco delivery instead of going to the mart yourself. Maybe I’m paranoid, but reduce eating salad/half-cooked beef/ anything not cooked thoroughly. I’ve bought redoxon for my parents, something you can check with your doc if it’s good for you.Im in Singapore. We’re not in quarantine but we’re already in the stage of buying and prepping.

IF the numbers keep increasing the chances of cases going under the radar also increase so agter a while you can keep casestracing or isolation of evey individual etc any more. > Once community transmission happens, the entire city will go on lockdown, everyone washing and sanitizing their hand, sanitizing the streets and buildings, wearing masks etc. These things can reduce transmissions by a lot.Yes and thats what s called an epidemic.

In fact i have read claims that it wouldnt effect it somuch but maybe sunhcine , UV rays might have some impact on it . Who knows.

fhisss6,-0.3424,-0.8689,"Well, it all depends on how you define ""sick"". It's very likely the number of mild and asymptomatic people is grossly underestimated in the data so far. I keep waiting for a decent estimate of the undiagnosed population based on geo-coded community sampling. With such a sample, you could build a reasonable model of the undiagnosed based on the number of people showing up at hospitals in a given area.But alas, this comforting thought is offset by the high r0 and the reality that many more people will contract COVID-19 than the seasonal flu. If the r0 is anything like 4.0 or above, we are in for some real trouble.Why? Because the US hospital system is already running without much slack. We have 1/3 fewer hospital beds today than we did in 1975 and 40% more people.

So the 1 in 100 cases which result in death you would expect that the 1 case would likely be an elderly person with existing health conditions. He was only 34 and presumably in good health whilst receiving treatment in hospital. You would think his survival/recovery chance would be high. It doesn't make sense to me with such a low estimated CFR.

I had to write a note asking that my son not get the sanitizer and instead use soap and water. But really that was the only precaution. I never would have asked it to be banned from the classroom.

fhjqcka,-0.9798,0.3818,"IMPORTANT: I just want to point out to everyone Hydroxychloroquine is a precursor to Fluoroquinolone antibiotics which have been known to cause serious adverse life altering effects. Bayer was also going to provide Avelox (moxifloxacin) to coronavirus patients in China according to multiple news sources.   This recent research article on coronavirus talked about kidney damage due to the coronavirus. What they did not mention in that research article is if Fluoroquinolones or Chloroquines were used, if so they may be the cause for kidney damage and not the Coronavirus given that fluoroquinolones can cause kidney damage.  [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021212v1.article-info](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021212v1.article-info)  Fluoroquinolones can also cause tendon rupture up to 14 months after taking them. Aneurysms, torsades de pointes, delirium, central nervous system disorders, neuropathy, severe low blood sugar, bodywide pain and/or weakness, mitochondrial damage, gastointestinal issues, kidney damage, collagen depletion, mental disturbances - anxiety, depression, insomnia, panic attacks, clouded thinking, depersonalization, suicidal thoughts, psychosis, nightmares, and impaired memory beginning within days of FQ initiation or days to months of FQ discontinuation, massive amounts of oxidative stress (inflammation), Guillain-Barre' Syndrome and the list goes on.   Fluoroquinolones deplete B12, Magnesium, and Glutathione.   I have linked some of the research articles below the first two are probably the most eye opening. I put this out there because there are many people that have suffered serious permanent life altering reactions with these antibiotics.

So basically, I had a normal common cold.  Doctors need to stop using this term right now and just call it a cold or flu when its not the Chinese Flu.Unfortunately, I have a boss with OCD and she thinks the entire office is going to die if I return to work, so I have been off the entire week and she won't let me return until she sees a note from my doctor saying I ""do not have the China flu"".  I also have to sign a HIPAA form in order for her to CALL my doctor and verbally verify that over the phone.  When I told my doctor this, they laughed and laughed and called her insane.

(Presumably because the healthcare system is totally overwhelmed & unable to provide adequate modern care). Roughly 2-5% CFR for confirmed/IDENTIFIED cases outside mainland China. Again, the presumed reason is the healthcare systems aren’t overwhelmed there. That CFR is cut in half to about 1% if you lump in a bunch of unconfirmed but statistically assumed asymptomatic or mild cases that didn’t get picked up by screening methods. So bottom line is “If you live in an area that has modern healthcare that is NOT overwhelmed, your CFR is probably about 1% if there are a bunch of mild/asymptomatic cases out there. If there isn’t a bunch of mild or asymptomatic cases then it’s about 2-5%.

For cases detected in Hubei, we estimate the CFR to be 18% (95% credible interval: 11%-81%). For cases detected in travellers outside mainland China, we obtain central estimates of the CFR in the range 1.2-5.6% depending on the statistical methods, with substantial uncertainty around these central values. Using estimates of underlying infection prevalence in Wuhan at the end of January derived from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to Japan and Germany, we adjusted the estimates of CFR from either the early epidemic in Hubei Province, or from cases reported outside mainland China, to obtain estimates of the overall CFR in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear. Furthermore, all estimates rely on limited data on the typical time intervals from symptom onset to death or recovery which influences the CFR estimates.pdf Link: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-severity-10-02-2020.pdf",Imperial College of London estimates 18% fatality rate in Hubei province (the province where Wuhan is).,2020-02-13 17:11:44,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f3kdwa/imperial_college_of_london_estimates_18_fatality/

fhjld2n,-0.9882,0.3612,"This Is What It's Like to Survive the Coronavirus in WuhanBloomberg News7-9 minutesFor one coronavirus patient at ground zero of the outbreak, the journey from infection to recovery was a nightmare scenario that entailed multiple hospital visits, symptoms so severe he thought he would die and quarantine under police watch.Tiger Ye -- not his real name -- is a 21-year-old student in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the new, still little understood virus first emerged. Ye, who doesn’t want to be identified for fear of being ostracized, first suspected he’d caught the illness that’s spread around the world on Jan. 21, when he felt too weak to finish dinner. He checked his temperature, and it was up.Tiger YeTiger Ye at home in Wuhan on Feb. 13 after being discharged from quarantine.Source: Tiger YeAt the time, little was known about the virus now known as 2019-nCov, but paranoia was rapidly building after authorities confirmed the highly contagious pathogen was spreading between humans in the city of 11 million. It was midnight when Ye arrived at Wuhan’s top-tier Tongji Hospital to see a waiting room filled with people like him. Feverish, he knew he would have to wait hours to be tested.“I was scared,” he said. “Countless cases were piling up on the desks, and every single doctor was wearing protective clothes, something I’d never seen before.”What followed was more than two weeks of anxiety and desperation as Ye tried to confirm if he had the pneumonia-causing virus and get treatment for his increasingly severe symptoms. He was one of the lucky ones, beating the sickness in part because his father -- a health care worker -- was aware of the risks earlier than most of Wuhan’s population.Under SiegeMore than 1,000 people have died from the new coronavirus in Hubei, the Chinese province that Wuhan is the capital of, as a severe shortage of hospital beds, testing kits and other basic medical equipment mean many have to stand in line for hours to get diagnosed, and some die before even seeing a doctor. China has quarantined vast swathes of Hubei, and the outbreak has caused parts of the world’s second-biggest economy to shut down as scientists across the world race to find a cure.Read about how China has sacrificed Hubei to try and stem the virus spreadThe night Ye first sought treatment, he was able to procure medicine from a smaller hospital nearby after abandoning the wait at Tongji. Because his symptoms weren’t classed as very severe, doctors told him to just go home and quarantine himself.The first four days of the illness were brutal.“I suffered from a high fever and pains that tortured every part of my body,” said Ye, who’s a big fan of Japanese culture and has ambitions of becoming a voice actor. He spent the days watching Japanese cartoons to distract from the discomfort.‘Coughing Like I Was Going to Die’By the time his follow-up appointment at the hospital arrived four days later, the Wuhan government had locked down the city, barring anyone from leaving to stop the virus’ spread. Everything changed in an instant: roads were empty, prices for fresh fruit and vegetables surged, and residents were unsure if they were even allowed to leave their apartments.Ye’s condition had also deteriorated. “I was coughing like I was going to die,” he said.CT scanA CT scan of Ye’s lungs when his condition deteriorated at Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Jan. 25.Source: Tiger YeAt the hospital, multiple CT scans showed it was highly likely Ye had contracted the novel coronavirus and that it had spread to his lungs. Doctors deliberated if he qualified for a nucleic acid test, which would use the virus’ genetic sequence to confirm if he had been infected, but it was decided his case wasn’t severe enough, and the precious supply of test kits had to be reserved for more critical patients.‘Hell’s Door’Diagnosis has emerged as one of the major stumbling blocks in getting the virus under control in Hubei, where the number of those who fear they are infected far outweighs the capacity of hospitals to confirm if they are. On Thursday, Hubei began counting patients who were diagnosed via CT imaging alongside those who tested positive with the nucleic acid kits, resulting in a more than 45% surge in the number of confirmed cases, to nearly 50,000 people.As Ye convalesced at home after his second hospital visit -- not knowing if he had the virus or not -- his brother and grandmother also began to show symptoms of infection. Overnight, Ye’s condition worsened to the point he thought he might die.“I thought I was knocking on hell’s door,” he said.Ye went back to the hospital after his temperature soared to 39 degrees Celsius (about 102 degrees Fahrenheit). Doctors put him on an iv and administered Kaletra, a combination drug used to treat HIV that has shown some success in combating the virus, bringing his temperature down to 37 degrees by the end of the day.China Stages Clinical Trial Blitz in Search of Coronavirus CureA week after the symptoms first began, Ye appeared to be reaching a turning point.Virus ConfirmedThe young student’s condition was steadily improving when he finally secured one of the coveted test kits on Jan. 29. It confirmed he had the virus that’s triggered travel bans around the world. His doctor gave him a five-day course of the antiviral drug Aluvia and sent him back to his three-bedroom apartment for quarantine, in part because the hospital didn’t have enough beds to accommodate him.CHINA-HEALTH-VIRUSMedical staff and workers set up beds as they prepare to accept patients displaying mild symptoms of novel coronavirus infection at an exhibition center converted into a hospital in Wuhan on Feb. 6.Photographer: Stringer/AFP via Getty ImagesNine days later on Feb. 7, another set of nucleic acid tests came back negative for the virus, but Ye wasn’t out of the woods. After reports that even patients who tested negative could slip into critical distress, the local government quarantined him in a hotel that had been turned into a makeshift hospital. Police stood guard outside to prevent anyone from leaving or entering.Ye was allowed to go home five days later, ending a saga that began more than three weeks ago. He‘s thankful he survived, and salutes the doctors and nurses who put their own lives at risk to help him. Some doctors told him they suspected they had the virus, but continued to treat patients.China’s Sick Doctors Show How Infection Breaches Fan CoronavirusLike many Chinese, Ye is critical of the government’s response to the outbreak, especially the slow initial response from local officials that meant a precious opportunity to contain the virus early on was missed. The two most senior Communist Party cadres in Hubei were replaced Thursday, as Beijing tries to gain control of the spiraling crisis.“Hubei has missed one opportunity after another while they were trying to keep things under wraps,” Ye said. “Things wouldn’t have come to this point if the government hadn’t hidden information a month ago.”— With assistance by Claire Che",'I Knocked on Hell's Door': This Is What It Feels Like to Catch the Coronavirus,2020-02-13 18:48:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f3lmka/i_knocked_on_hells_door_this_is_what_it_feels/

But if the future is so bright why are people having less kids? No one is sure how to cure this general malaise. Some people see the world population as too high and an epidemic or war would fix that.Not saying it's right or wrong, just why I think we are seeing it. The real cure is to see the future as better than the past, and for people to feel their lives are getting better. But we are told inequality is increasing, wages are not going up but things are getting more expensive. If you are well off you would not notice it but others do.If voting or other measures do not change ( e.g. political parties do basically the same thing ) then some people wonder if chaos might fix it since order does not.History says chaos benefits the rich and the poor get screwed.",Lusting after chaos?,2020-02-13 19:30:21,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f3m5ui/lusting_after_chaos/

fhkdllr,0.9637,-0.4939,"As a Veterinarian, maybe I can give some feedback to this.**TLDR:**\-Seems like a **good article with trustworthy references**. However, theory remains theory and so far **no signs of orchitis have been described as of yet** **in COVID19 infected patients.**\-Be aware that the **testicles have a special barrier to protect themselves against diseases and the immune system**, so it is better defended than other organs like for example the lungs. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250082/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250082/)\-**Still should be aware and on the lookout for signs/symptoms** that could affect the testicles and other organs **as it is a new virus.**\-**Virus infection** **in the testicles does not necessarily equate to orchitis**. However, if orchitis occurs, it is well known that orchitis **can** lead to fertility problems. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20449780](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20449780)&#x200B;\------------------------.   **DETAILED VERSION:**This is actually a very interesting article and it was smart of them to notice which organs have high expressions of ACE2 receptors. However, I'm not sure if it is safe to say that the presence of ACE2 receptors is directly causal to tissue damage; as, if you look at ACE2 protein expression in the lungs at the end of the article it is actually quite low. Yet, as most now know, most of the more serious tissue damage while being infected by the virus occurs in the lower respiratory tract. The pathogenicity of the virus is still being studied, and as such, it is hard to know or predict these types of tissue damage.The good news so far is that of all of the three studies cited in the article above (as well as other case descriptions being published), although signs of kidney damage have been described, no signs of orchitis (which is the inflammation of the testes) have been described as of yet. If you look at common symptoms and complications in case descriptions as well as recent publications on the COVID19, you will notice that most of the organs/systems that tend to be affected are the lungs/respiratory system, GI tract, heart and less commonly the kidneys. Orchitis has yet to be described as far as I know.Having said that, the article seems good and has good references; however, it is only a theoretical article and early theory does not always equate to reality when it comes to certain pathogenetic mechanisms of diseases. Furthermore, if you want to base yourself on theory, you have to be very exhaustive and take into consideration the basic physiology/anatomy/histology of the organ you are researching as well. In other words, when it comes to the testicles, one should also consider how they work in the body and why they are more ""protected"" than say the lungs or GI tract when it comes to disease as they have a special blood barrier that is there specifically to protect against diseases and one's own immune system ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250082/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250082/)).Some small comments on the article:\- The cohort nº 3 only had 6 patients, not sure if it is enough; however, given the limited amount of information so far on COVID19, it is understandable.\- It appears to contain good reference material.\- Their conclusion seems to be well-advised; we should be aware of the potential pathogenicity of the virus in other organs, including how it could affect the testes and fertility given the information we know thus far. Clinicians should remain on the lookout for any signs and symptoms that could affect such organs/tissues; as it is something that some might not think to pay attention to at first glance in COVID19 infected patients. Better be safe than sorry, and better be cautious when it comes to a new virus we have limited knowledge about.\- We do not know whether a virus infection from COVID19 can even spread to the testicles. Even if it could spread to the testicles, we also do not know if an infection by the virus could actually cause orchitis or fertility problems. However, we do know that orchitis as a general sign is both correlated to and can cause fertility problems.

Flu antibodies stay in your system for life so you develop some level of resistance and it can be cross strain resistance.With Corona viruses you don't appear to develop cross strain resistance and the antibodies are gone in a few months or so I read. this means that if you think you're going to treat it as easy as influenza you're probably kidding yourself. If you take normal influenza treatments I think the best case scenario has to be that this virus is harder to create vaccines for because even if you do create traditional vaccines you don't have long lasting antibodies to work with.

fhm9k6f,-0.7267,0.7096,"You don’t have to look to fiction for an example of asymptomatic transmission of disease.  Every time I read about an asymptomatic carrier, I think about Typhoid Mary.https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/typhoid-marys-life-sentence-quarantineTyphoid Mary’s life sentence in quarantineNorth Brother Island is a 16.5-acre bump of land jutting out of the East River, 1,500 feet east of 140th Street in the South Bronx and 2,500 feet west of Riker’s Island. Once the site of New York City’s lazaretto, or quarantine hospital, it is now a favorite nesting point for herons and egrets. In its long career as an agent of quarantine, however, North Brother Island deserves mention as the enforced residence of New York City cook Mary Malone, or as she was better known, “Typhoid Mary.”In 1884, Mallon emigrated from Tyrone County in Ireland to the United States. She was only 15. Mary earned her income as a domestic and a cook in the New York City area. Between 1900 and 1907, she infected many people with Salmonella typhosa — then the name for the causative organism of typhoid fever. Less understood to doctors of the time—and explicated so nicely through Mary Malone’s case–was that salmonella carriers can be completely asymptomatic while still spreading the germ, which tends to harbor in a person’s gall bladder. Modern bacteriology dictates that the microbe sheds in feces and urine, demanding excellent hand washing, especially before preparing food, to cut down on the spread.An intrepid New York City Health Department epidemiologist named George Soper tracked down a spate of typhoid cases that began in a Park Avenue penthouse where Mary worked. Dr. Soper demanded she turn over urine and stool samples, but Mary refused. As his investigation continued, Soper discovered that of eight families Mary had previously worked for as a cook, seven of them had experienced bouts of typhoid fever. Soper made many more entreaties to Malone, all for naught. Once when she was hospitalized he even promised to write a book about her and give her all the royalties. Still, Mary refused to cooperate, insisted that she had done nothing wrong, and complained that she was being persecuted by the City of New York. In 1907, city officials arrested her in the name of the public’s health. More than one newspaper reported she was “crawling with typhoid bugs.” But it was the Journal of the American Medical Association, in a 1908 issue, that is credited with coining the now famous epithet, “Typhoid Mary.”The New York City health department physicians gave her an ultimatum: submit to an operation to remove her gall bladder or be imprisoned on the lazaretto. Abdominal surgery of that era was fraught with deadly complications and infections and Mary understandably rejected such a choice. The officials then, literally, sent her up the river to North Brother Island, where, under sections 1169 and 1170 of the Greater New York City Charter, she lived in a tiny brick bungalow until she was released in 1910.One of the conditions of her freedom was a promise that she would no longer earn her income working as a cook. Initially Mary worked as a laundress. But soon enough, to make ends meet, she took on kitchen jobs against doctor’s orders. The result were still more outbreaks of the deadly typhoid.On March 27, 1915, the New York City Sanitary Police tracked her down, this time on a Long Island estate. Mary Malone was confined to North Brother Island, never to return to a normal or free life. She resided there until her death, at age 69, in 1938. One of her “jobs” there was to wash the bottles and glassware used in the quarantine hospital’s laboratory. Upon her autopsy, the pathologist diagnosed evidence of live typhoid bacilli in her gall bladder.“Typhoid Mary” lives on in the popular culture because the very name conjures a personification of a spreading epidemic or contagious crisis. Perhaps more important, Mary’s case history introduced physicians to the concept of a carrier state, whereby seemingly healthy people can spread typhoid fever as they harbor the disease-producing microbe in their bodies without apparent harm to themselves.As we mark the day in medical history when Mary Malone received her life sentence, however, it is worthwhile reflecting on how harshly public health officials once handled those deemed a contagious threat to others. And what a terrible life sentence it must have been. A little less than century later, standing on the rocky shoals of the island, peering into the distance, the city seems remote and inaccessible. From Mary’s perspective of forced isolation for more than 30 years, it must have been truly painful.",Ontario couple have recovered but are still testing positive for coronavirus,2020-02-13 23:42:15,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f3owxe/ontario_couple_have_recovered_but_are_still/

From my opinion, the professor and two research assistants are all innocent. Why? Because as a Chinese, I know that there’re universities in China funded by military.
