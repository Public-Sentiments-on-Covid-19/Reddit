That does not mean this information is not available. Not to mention that at this point all countries know what to watch for in this specific virus. When the virus began in Wuhan it was a complete unknown, meaning that the doctors had to realize there was a new virus, figure out the symptoms and transmission modes, release the full genetic information of the virus to the world.

fhrpgjc,-0.9669,-0.1531,"> Deliberately ignoring and misleading my ass. None of the sources I came across so far explicitly stated the numbers represent hospital cases only.Confirmed cases are cases confirmed, not estimates.  Doctors to go from door to door every day in a city of 8 million people to all request them to take swabs whether or not they think they have it or not.  They have better things to do, like treating patients.  You can not count everyone you suspect that has Covid, because then you would be counting everyone that has the flu and your death rate numbers will be going down and which statistic would you rather want to have off, number of infected or death rate, and don't say 'I want both of them be 100%' accurate, because then I'll just say to you that you probably have two legs and are able to count and go by people's homes door-to-door, so why don't you?     Oh, and by the way, this is how SARS was counted and it'd be nice if you could put them next to each other as to compare the two.  > Regardless, I don't think any other country would launch emergency production of extra ambulances if 0,54 % of one city's population or less became ill which is exactly how much 60k is for 11 millionYeah sure.So how much time do you think an ambulance will take to handle 1 person?30 seconds? 2 minutes? How about it will probably take ~30 minutes on average just to drive to and fro to a hospital, so that's going 50 cases per day max?  Or how about I take these numbers:  https://www.gov.je/Government/JerseyInFigures/EmergencyServices/Pages/AmbulanceService.aspxAnd then count 13 vehicles needed for ~8,000 total emergency calls responded to in a year.  That's 13 vehicles for 21 emergency calls per day.Now we've got at least 2100 people extra per day needing hospital assistance.  If just 10% would need an ambulance for that, you get an extra 210 emergency calls per day extra. In other words, you need an extra 130 emergency vehicles to cope with this virus and that's when the virus is just warming up.  This problem can still multiply by a 1000, so you're looking at a possible need for 130,000 extra ambulances this year for your country if you were a Chinese official.  But I think you know all this, I've exposed you and now as a defense you're simply trying to play dumb.",CCP releases positive news propaganda showing rapid production of many new ambulances...

fhmjfoc,0.9794,0.0,"I'd expect the central banks to inject stimulus to prevent a financial collapse. That said the impact of COVID-19 on supply chains merits in & of itself a massive market selloff in terms of stock prices, which informs both directly & indirectly the value held in pension funds. The dilemma as I see it is the sell off in stocks could see an inflation in costs of day to day essentials as that money exits the market then starts competing for the ever dwindling pool of goods due to the supply chain issues driving massive inflation. This in turn could see any initial stimulus package appear inadequate against the tide of inflation, prompting yet further stimulus. This all leads to a familar, yet little known monetary concept known as Gresham's Law. Bad money drives out good money. Let me explain. In this concept bad money is the Nation's fiat currencies that have a variable supply by decree of your Nation's Central Bank. Good money is anything that meets the requirements of money but has a fixed rate of supply. Because of the monetary stimulus the value of that fiat money is constantly diminishing in terms of it's purchasing power against the diminishing pool of goods. Basically this is a recipe of high inflation. For the good money, the opposite becomes true. It's fixed supply means it becomes a supreme store of wealth, with custmers preferring to save the good money for later, instead preferring to spend fiat money first because of it's constantly diminishing purchasing power. Thus the over supply of bad money drives out of the market place the good money.",How should we prepare economically?,2020-02-14 12:27:25,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f3y7p7/how_should_we_prepare_economically/

fhmsvvi,0.6434,-0.2382,"Like some others had posted in this thread, China let this shit get out of control and are now trying to play catchup with a virus that has already spread through a significant portion of the population of Wuhan, a city of 11 million. Other countries have been on top of this from day one it entered their country, giving them ample time to isolate and track down any known potential contacts with the infected. I believe many of the deaths have been due to a lack of adequate medical care and ventilators to keep them alive long enough for their immune systems to overcome the virus. With that said it doesn't mean that this won't become a pandemic, but keeping up with the virus buys time for a vaccine to be created and distributed to where it is needed, it also allows medical facilities to keep up with the number of patients who need intensive care instead of being overwhelmed like Wuhan. Basically, a stupid beaurocrat who reprimanded Dr. Li is responsible, in my view, for a lot of these deaths. I imagine this party official had no medical background and should have yielded to Dr. Li's knowledge. Just fucking ignorant shit.","Scared to ask this, but...

fhngefg,-0.8928,0.2732,"Earlier I quoted a paper that stated the number of people requiring hospitalization at 18%. Someone said that was ""hyperbolic misinformation"". However, 11 people gives a current rate of 5.04% requiring hospitalization. Every day that number will increase and plateau at some level. We will soon find out what the number is. At any rate, the difference between 5% and 18%, and getting smaller every day, by the way, is not a hyperbolic amount. My guess is that the number will slowly increase and plateau somewhere between 15-25%. Likely, closer to the middle of the range (i.e. 18-20%). Obviously, there is some gray areas of uncertainty here.Let's take this a little further. From another paper, if you have it and need hospitalization and modern medical intervention and you don't get it, then your chances of death go up to 50-60%. Currently, everyone that needs hospital care can get it. My belief is that at some point the system will get overwhelmed. Let's use 50% for simplicity. So, 50% of the 20% above gives an overall case fatality rate of 10% (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1). That 10% is predicated on receiving no oxygen in a hospital, no ventilator, no antibiotics for opportunistic infections, etc. In other words, you die at home because the system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, 10% is about the same CFR as the 1918 Spanish influenza. That resulted in the death of 1% of all human life on the planet. My belief is that barring some miracle drug or magic vaccine, we will be seeing the same types of numbers this time around too. The final death toll, world wide, when it is all said and done (18 months), will be about 74 million. Again, a miracle cure would obviously change things in a major way. We have better tech now than we did 100 years ago. So, that's good news, right.  Further, I also believe that China is internally seeing these same kinds of numbers which would result in a situation that matches the current video ""evidence"" we see leaking out of that country. When you use their public numbers, China's response to the crisis seems a bit much. When you use the ""back of the napkin"" numbers from above, then their response seems much more reasonable. The emergency hospitals seems more reasonable. People walling off their villages seems more reasonable.Fun Fact: The 1918 Spanish Flu ended in 1920. So, it's the 100 year anniversary.",Diamond Princess: 11 out of 218 in serious state,2020-02-14 15:22:53,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f40qws/diamond_princess_11_out_of_218_in_serious_state/

fhnm6gp,-0.9602,0.2732,"Like everyone else, I'm watching this cruise like a hawk to see if there are any details we can glean about the virus from it, especially if for whatever reason you don't trust the Chinese numbers. But it is worth remembering a few things.   First off, the figure of 15% of cases in China that are serious. It seems very likely that the only cases that are being identified in China are already fairly progressed cases. They're not wasting testing kits with thousands infected on people with mild or no symptoms. I imagine mostly people who feel sick enough to go to the hospital - knowing it will be full of coronavirus patients! - are being identified. The ""clinical diagnosis"" for coronavirus shows up on a chest x-ray. If there are mild cases, they won't be showing up on that x-ray, they won't be going to the hospitals. But then there is also a time lag between cases starting up and cases becoming very serious. So it's a similar story with the fatality rate - we have a couple factors that could go either way.  Secondly with the cruise. While the healthcare system there isn't overwhelmed and you'd expect better data, it's worth pointing out that they still haven't tested everybody on board - again, to some extent I imagine people with clear symptoms are being tested. And I also believe that over half of the people on board were over 65 - lots of retirees like cruises - and it may well be the case that a higher proportion of those cases become serious.   Hopefully the serious caseload is very low compared to the total number infected. But ultimately, if the total number infected is high enough, it will still be enough to overwhelm medical systems, so no room for complacency here.",Diamond Princess: 11 out of 218 in serious state,2020-02-14 15:22:53,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f40qws/diamond_princess_11_out_of_218_in_serious_state/

His estimate implies that there could eventually be billions more infections than the current official tally of about 60,000.  >  >If the virus spreads to anywhere near that extent, it will show the limitations of China's strict containment measures, including quarantining areas inhabited by tens of millions of people.

The country boosted its count of those infected by almost 15,000 on Thursday after widening the diagnosis methods.  >  >Longini's modeling is based on data showing that each infected person normally transmits the disease to two to three other people. A lack of rapid tests and the relative mildness of the infection in some people also makes it difficult to track its spread, he said.  >  >Even if there were a way to reduce transmission by half, that would still imply that roughly one-third of the world would become infected, Longini said.*Had to view source and pull out a bunch of code, but I think this is all of it.*",WHO Adviser Predicts 2/3 of World Population will be infected.,2020-02-14 17:00:45,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4200r/who_adviser_predicts_23_of_world_population_will/

The assumption in the 80's is that you would wear your seatbelt, and if your face was cracked off of the steering wheel, well, that was that. But now we have airbags as extra protection. Are seat belts no longer necessary because we have airbags? No, of course not. They are supplemental protection. They support each other.Maybe a face mask complements my protection regimen along with hand washing? It's not to replace it. Washing my hands is not going to protect me if some skeez on public transit sneezes in my face. At least I'll have a fighting chance with a mask.I think the reason why people are so averse to masks is because western culture does not put emphasis on the group, but on the individual. Because of that, a lot of people don't wear masks when they get sick, and they are not rarely seen outside of a hospital or construction setting, so it makes people feel uneasy. Perhaps we need to change that culture?","I finally understand, why masks seem not to help in public",2020-02-14 18:08:12,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f42taq/i_finally_understand_why_masks_seem_not_to_help/

fho38v9,-0.9654,0.0,"Here’s what coronavirus does to the bodyFrom blood storms to honeycomb lungs, here’s an organ-by-organ look at how COVID-19 harms humans.11 Minute ReadBy Amy McKeeverPUBLISHED February 14, 2020Much remains unknown about the novel coronavirus ripping through China, but one thing is certain. The disease can cast a storm over the whole human body.Such has been the nature of past zoonotic coronaviruses, ones that hopped from animals to humans like SARS and MERS. Unlike their common-cold-causing cousins, these emergent coronaviruses can spark a viral-induced fire throughout many of a person’s organs, and the new disease—dubbed ""COVID-19"" by the World Health Organization on Tuesday—is no exception when it is severe.That helps explain why the COVID-19 epidemic has killed more than 1,300 people, surpassing the SARS death toll in a matter of weeks. While the death rate for COVID-19 appears to be a tenth of SARS, the novel coronavirus has spread faster.Confirmed cases rose to more than 60,000 on Thursday, nearly a 50 percent jump relative to the prior day. This leap reflects a change in the way Chinese authorities are diagnosing infections instead of a massive shift in the scope of the outbreak. Rather than wait for patients to test positive for the virus, diagnoses now include anyone whose chest scan reveals COVID-19’s distinctive pattern of pneumonia. This method will hopefully allow authorities to isolate and treat patients more quickly.If this outbreak continues to spread, there’s no telling how harmful it could become. A leading epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong warned this week that COVID-19 could infect 60 percent of the globe if left unchecked. On Thursday, China’s National Health Commission said more than 1,700 health care workers are ill with the new virus, and the announcement came just a day after the WHO wrapped a summit on the best protocols for hospital care and the development of therapeutics, like vaccines.But what actually happens to your body when it is infected by the coronavirus? The new strain is so genetically similar to SARS that it has inherited the title SARS-CoV-2. So combining early research on the new outbreak with past lessons from SARS and MERS can provide an answer.The Lungs: Ground zeroFor most patients, COVID-19 begins and ends in their lungs, because like the flu, coronaviruses are respiratory diseases.They spread typically when an infected person coughs or sneezes, spraying droplets that can transmit the virus to anyone in close contact. Coronaviruses also cause flu-like symptoms: Patients might start out with a fever and cough that progresses to pneumonia or worse. (Find out how coronavirus spreads on a plane—and the safest place to sit).After the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization reported that the disease typically attacked the lungs in three phases: viral replication, immune hyper-reactivity, and pulmonary destruction.Not all patients went through all three phases—in fact only 25 percent of SARS patients suffered respiratory failure, the defining signature of severe cases. Likewise, COVID-19, according to early data, causes milder symptoms in about 82 percent of cases, while the remainder are severe or critical.Look deeper, and the novel coronavirus appears to follow other patterns of SARS, says University of Maryland School of Medicine associate professor Matthew B. Frieman, who studies highly pathogenic coronaviruses.Picture of medical staffMedical staff members hugging each other in an isolation ward at a hospital in Zouping in China's easter Shandong Province.Photograph by STR/AFP via Getty ImagesIn the early days of an infection, the novel coronavirus rapidly invades human lung cells. Those lung cells come in two classes: ones that make mucus and ones with hair-like batons called cilia.Mucus, though gross when outside the body, helps protect lung tissue from pathogens and make sure your breathing organ doesn’t dry out. The cilia cells beat around the mucus, clearing out debris like pollen or viruses.Frieman explains that SARS loved to infect and kill cilia cells, which then sloughed off and filled patients’ airways with debris and fluids, and he hypothesizes that the same is happening with the novel coronavirus. That’s because the earliest studies on COVID-19 have shown that many patients develop pneumonia in both lungs, accompanied by symptoms like shortness of breath.That’s when phase two and the immune system kicks in. Aroused by the presence of a viral invader, our bodies step up to fight the disease by flooding the lungs with immune cells to clear away the damage and repair the lung tissue.When working properly, this inflammatory process is tightly regulated and confined only to infected areas. But sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way, including your healthy tissue.“So you get more damage instead of less from the immune response,” Frieman says. Even more debris clogs up the lungs, and pneumonia worsens. (Find out how the novel coronavirus compares to flu, Ebola, and other major outbreaks).Lungs 101 The lungs replenish the body with life-giving oxygen. Learn about the anatomy of the lungs, how the organs make respiration possible, and how they are vulnerable to illnesses.During the third phase, lung damage continues to build—which can result in respiratory failure. Even if death doesn’t occur, some patients survive with permanent lung damage. According to the WHO, SARS punched holes in the lungs, giving them “a honeycomb-like appearance”—and these lesions are present in those afflicted by novel coronavirus, too.These holes are likely created by the immune system’s hyperactive response, which creates scars that both protect and stiffen the lungs.When that occurs, patients often have to be put on ventilators to assist their breathing. Meanwhile, inflammation also makes the membranes between the air sacs and blood vessels more permeable, which can fill the lungs with fluid and affect their ability to oxygenate blood.“In severe cases, you basically flood your lungs and you can’t breathe,” Frieman says. “That’s how people are dying.”The Stomach: A shared gatewayDuring the SARS and MERS outbreaks, nearly a quarter of patients had diarrhea—a much more significant feature of those zoonotic coronaviruses. But Frieman says it’s still not clear whether gastrointestinal symptoms play a major part in the latest outbreak, given cases diarrhea and abdominal pain have been rare. But why does a respiratory virus bother the gut at all?When any virus enters your body, it looks for human cells with its favorite doorways—proteins on the outside of the cells called receptors. If the virus finds a compatible receptor on a cell, it can invade.",Nat geo: here is what the Coronavirus does to the body.,2020-02-14 18:50:29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f43bh7/nat_geo_here_is_what_the_coronavirus_does_to_the/

fho3a5r,-0.9962,0.0,"What is a Virus? Scientists at USAMRID, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious diseases, work with some of the most deadly forms of life on earth, killer viruses. Learn more.Some viruses are picky about which door they choose, but others are a little more promiscuous. “They can very easily penetrate into all types of cells,” says Anna Suk-Fong Lok, assistant dean for clinical research at the University of Michigan Medical School and former president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.Both SARS and MERS viruses can access the cells that line your intestines and large and small colon, and those infections appear to flourish in the gut, potentially causing the damage or the leakage of fluid that becomes diarrhea.But Frieman says we don’t know yet if the novel coronavirus does the same. Researchers believe COVID-19 uses the same receptor as SARS, and this doorway can be found in your lungs and small intestines.Two studies—one in the New England Journal of Medicine and one preprint in medRxiv involving 1,099 cases—have also detected the virus in stool samples, which might indicate the virus could spread via feces. But this is far from conclusive.“Whether that kind of fecal transmission is occuring for this Wuhan virus, we don’t know at all,” Frieman says. “But it definitely looks like it’s there in the stool and it looks like people do have GI symptoms associated with this.”Blood stormCoronaviruses can also cause problems in other systems of the body, due to the hyperactive immune response we mentioned earlier.A 2014 study showed that 92 percent of patients with MERS had at least one manifestation of the coronavirus outside of the lungs. In fact, signs of a full body blitz have been witnessed with all three of the zoonotic coronaviruses: elevated liver enzymes, lower white blood cell and platelet count, and low blood pressure. In rare cases, patients have suffered from acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest.But this isn’t necessarily a sign that the virus itself is spreading throughout the body, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and associate research scientist at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. It might be a cytokine storm.   Basically you’re bleeding out of your blood vessels.Angela Rasmussen, virologistCytokines are proteins used by the immune system as alarm beacons—they recruit immune cells to the site of infection. The immune cells then kill off the infected tissue in a bid to save the rest of the body.Humans rely on our immune systems to keep their cool when facing a threat. But during a runaway coronavirus infection, when the immune system dumps cytokines into the lungs without any regulation, this culling becomes a free-for-all, Rasmussen says “Instead of shooting at a target with a gun, you’re using a missile launcher,” she says. That’s where the problem arises: Your body is not just targeting the infected cells. It is attacking healthy tissue too.The implications extend outside the lungs. Cytokine storms create inflammation that weakens blood vessels in the lungs and causes fluid to seep through to the air sacs. “Basically you’re bleeding out of your blood vessels,” Rasmussen says. The storm spills into your circulatory system and creates systemic issues across multiple organs.From there, things can take a sharp turn for the worse. In some of the most severe COVID-19 cases, the cytokine response—combined with a diminished capacity to pump oxygen to the rest of the body—can result in multi-organ failure. Scientists don’t know exactly why some patients experience complications outside of the lung, but it might be linked to underlying conditions like heart disease or diabetes.“Even if the virus doesn’t get to kidneys and liver and spleen and other things, it can have clear downstream effects on all of those processes,” Frieman says. And that’s when things can get serious.Today’sPopular StoriesScienceStarstruckThe first person to see the 'Pale Blue Dot' image still has it stashed in her closetAnimalsWorld’s largest cave fish discovered in IndiaScienceA huge iceberg just broke off West Antarctica’s most endangered glacierLiver: Collateral damageWhen a zoonotic coronavirus spreads from the respiratory system, your liver is often one downstream organ that suffers. Doctors have seen indications of liver injury with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19—often mild, though more severe cases have led to severe liver damage and even liver failure. So what’s happening?“Once a virus gets into your bloodstream, they can swim to any part of your body,” Lok says. “The liver is a very vascular organ so \[a coronavirus\] can very easily get into your liver.”Your liver works pretty hard to make sure your body can function properly. Its main job is to process your blood after it leaves the stomach, filtering out the toxins and creating nutrients your body can use. It also makes the bile that helps your small intestine break down fats. Your liver also contains enzymes, which speed up chemical reactions in the body.In a normal body, Lok explains, liver cells are constantly dying off and releasing enzymes into your bloodstream. This resourceful organ then quickly regenerates new cells and carries on with its day. Because of that regeneration process, the liver can withstand a lot of injury.When you have abnormally high levels of enzymes in your blood, though—as has been a common characteristic of patients suffering from SARS and MERS—it’s a warning sign. It might be a mild injury that the liver will quickly bounce back from or it could be something more severe—even liver failure.Lok says scientists don’t completely understand how these respiratory viruses behave in the liver. The virus might be directly infecting the liver, replicating and killing off the cells itself. Or those cells might be collateral damage as your body’s immune response to the virus sets off a severe inflammatory reaction in the liver.",Nat geo: here is what the Coronavirus does to the body.,2020-02-14 18:50:29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f43bh7/nat_geo_here_is_what_the_coronavirus_does_to_the/

fho3bc2,-0.996,0.0,"Either way, she notes that liver failure was never the sole cause of death for SARS patients. “By the time the liver fails,” she says, “oftentimes you’ll find that the patient not only has lung problems and liver problems but they may also have kidney problems. By then it becomes a systemic infection.”Kidney: It’s all connectedYes, your kidneys are caught up in this mess, too. Six percent of SARS patients—and a full quarter of MERS patients—suffered acute renal injury. Studies have shown the novel coronavirus can do the same. It may be a relatively uncommon feature of the disease, but it is a fatal one. Ultimately 91.7 percent of SARS patients with acute renal impairment died, according to a 2005 study in Kidney International.Like the liver, your kidneys act as a filter your blood. Each kidney is filled with about 800,000 of microscopic distilling units called nephrons. These nephrons have two main components: a filter to clean the blood and a little tubes that return the good stuff back to your body or send the waste down to your bladder as urine.It’s the kidney tubules that seem to be most affected by these zoonotic coronaviruses. After the SARS outbreak, the WHO reported that the virus was found in kidney tubules, which can become inflamed.It’s not uncommon to detect a virus in the tubules if it’s in your bloodstream, says Kar Neng Lai, a professor emeritus at the University of Hong Kong and consultant nephrologist at Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital. As your kidneys are continuously filtering blood, sometimes the tubular cells can trap the virus and cause a transient, or milder, injury.How Flu Viruses Attack See how a flu virus attacks, mutates, and becomes contagious—perhaps resulting in an outbreak or even pandemic.That injury could become lethal if the virus penetrates the cells and begins to replicate. But Lai—who was also a member of the first group of researchers reporting on SARS and contributed to the Kidney International study—says there was no evidence that the SARS virus was replicating in the kidney.That finding, Lai says, suggests acute kidney injury in SARS patients might be due to a diverse set of causes, including low blood pressure, sepsis, drugs, or a metabolic disturbance. Meanwhile, the more severe cases that led to acute renal failure showed signs of—you guessed it—a cytokine storm.Acute renal failure can also sometimes be brought on by antibiotics, multi-organ failure, or being connected to a ventilator for too long. Everything is connected.Pregnancy and coronavirus?It’s the great irony of the Twitter age that we know too little about the novel coronavirus as we drown in information updates about it. Medical journals have published several studies about this outbreak—some more vetted than others as researchers rush to feed the maw. Meanwhile, news outlets are reporting every development. All this information whirls around the internet where discerning fact from fiction is a notorious challenge.“This is really unprecedented in terms of the up-to-the-minute reporting on what’s going on in these studies,” Rasmussen says. “It’s really tricky trying to sort through all of the information and figure out what’s really supported, what’s speculative, and what’s plain wrong.”For example last week, doctors at a hospital in Wuhan reported that two infants tested positive for the novel coronavirus, one just 30 hours after birth. Naturally, this troubling headline spread across news organizations, given it raised questions of whether pregnant women can infect their unborn children in utero or whether the disease can be transmitted during birth or through breast milk.But let’s pump the breaks. Mother-to-infant transmission wasn’t observed with SARS nor MERS despite numerous cases involving pregnant women. Plus, there are other ways a newborn could catch the coronavirus, Rasmussen says, such as by being born at hospital overrun with infected patients during a hectic emergency.In fact, a new study published Thursday in The Lancet offers preliminary evidence that the coronavirus cannot be passed from mother to child.In the report, researchers observed nine women in Wuhan who had COVID-19 pneumonia. Some of the women had pregnancy complications, but all cases resulted in live births without evidence of transmitting the infection. While this study doesn’t completely rule out the possibility of transmission during pregnancy, it underscores the need to exercise caution in speculating about this disease.“There needs to be a high standard of evidence before you can say that’s happening definitively—and certainly before you start making changes to how cases are managed clinically or in terms of public policy,” Rasmussen says.Frieman agrees. He hopes this epidemic will prompt more funding for coronavirus research like the recent pledges from the European Union and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. But Frieman wants the support and interest to last even if this outbreak eventually fizzles out, unlike what happened with SARS research.“Right after the SARS outbreak, there was a big bunch of money and then it went away,” Frieman says. “Why don’t we have these answers? Nobody funded these things.”",Nat geo: here is what the Coronavirus does to the body.,2020-02-14 18:50:29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f43bh7/nat_geo_here_is_what_the_coronavirus_does_to_the/

SARS-COV-2, the novel virus is (according to chinese numbers), at a 5% mortality rate in Hubei province, where it struck the hardest, **as of yet**.Combine that with the higher R0 than that of H1N1 and apply some papers and preprints from highly reputable scientists, you see why this situation is much different than any flu like scenario.Lets make an example:Scientists estimate that 2/3 of the world population could get infected by this virus. Lets project that on a small town of 40.000 people. 18% are considered to be severe cases. 2% overall mortality rate. (Although this is still in the air).Population: 40.000Infected people overall: 26.400From those infections are severe: 4.752Overall death of those infected: 528And now comes the problem, a city with 40.000 people usually has only one hospital. This hospital does not have ICU beds for 4.752 patients. It has at max place for less than 30. Maybe 50 patients.So what is happening to the other 4.700 people that need extensive care?You don’t need to be a genius to realize the threat and that many more than just 528 people will die in a city of **just** 40.000 people.Exactly the same is happening in Wuhan now, just on a bigger scale. The ICU bed/per resident ratio is even smaller. And don’t get me started on the economical implications.However, no one of us wants the situation to go that path.

Staying aware and sticking to scientific facts however is not fear mongering, although it may pull you out of your everyday life and end your normalcy bias, once you realize that when shit hits the fan, the average household has less than a week of food at home.If you made it until here, let me tell you that I appreciate anyone reading the whole comment.",Coronavirus COVID-19 prompts China to lock down its megacities as the death toll climbs,2020-02-14 19:37:47,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f43vok/coronavirus_covid19_prompts_china_to_lock_down/

fho5me2,-0.9909,0.0,"Full Text :SYDNEY (AFP) - Top Australian universities warned on Friday (Feb 14) that Chinese students may walk away from courses Down Under after Canberra extended a coronavirus travel ban, in a major blow to the multi-billion-dollar sector.Nearly 70,000 Chinese visa holders are due to start their semesters soon at eight top-ranked universities, but have been stuck since the bans started on Feb 1, said Ms Vicki Thomson, chief executive of Group of Eight, which represents the universities.""We can't give our students any certainty as to when they can actually come here. So there is a risk of students choosing not to come here,"" Ms Thomson said.""We are in quite unprecedented times and uncertain times.""Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Thursday that the ban would be extended for at least another week, drawing the ire of China, which branded the move an ""overreaction"".Ms Thompson warned that countries with competing universities, such as Britain and Canada, remain open to Chinese students and many people could look elsewhere.Swelling Chinese enrolment numbers - up from fewer than 23,000 in 2003 during the Sars outbreak to more than 150,000 in 2018 - and the timing of the coronavirus at the start of the nation's academic year meant the impact was unprecedented, she said.""Put all those factors together and, you know, it couldn't have happened at a worse time.""International education was worth A$32.4 billion (S$30.3 billion) to the economy in 2017-18.Top universities stand to lose around US$2 billion (S$2.8 billion) in fees alone, according to recent preliminary estimates by Standard & Poor's.The virus has killed nearly 1,400 people and infected 64,000, mainly in China. As of Friday morning, 15 cases of the virus had been detected in Australia.The economic impact of the virus, chasing a summer of devastating bush fires, is yet to be realised. Australia's central bank held interest rates at a record low last week.""Obviously, the coronavirus will have an impact on the economy, (but) it is too early to quantify that impact,"" Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Friday.",Coronavirus: Universities say Chinese students may quit Australia,2020-02-14 20:50:37,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f44p14/coronavirus_universities_say_chinese_students_may/

The authors didn't consider or didn't comment on the ozone effect in their experiment. Had they conducted the trials in a laboratory hood with ventilation (as I suspect) then ozone degradation of the masks would not be an issue. However OP is suggesting that people put a UVC bulb in a box. I fear this would destroy the effectiveness of the masks rather quickly. If the bulb was used in a garage area with ventilation and on a timer then it would probably be okay. The article does not precisely state the minimum distance and time necessary to accomplish disinfection.,"A great article on how you can sterilize a N95 mask with a ultraviolet ""UV-C"" bulb!",2020-02-14 22:49:54,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f45vkj/a_great_article_on_how_you_can_sterilize_a_n95/

fhoube0,-0.7102,0.6588,"Here's what I would do if this virus became a considerable risk in my area:(1.) Breathing into a mask creates large amounts of moisture in a mask, which actually can make it attract the virus and other nasties. Your moisture and sweat will be one of the largest attractors, along with air gaps. Take multiple masks with you and change every 30 minutes if you're outside for that long.(2.) When at home dry the masks. Put only the masks in the dryer on high heat. If you dont have a dryer, buy a bathroom heat lamp and situate it inside a cardboard box lined with foil to reflect heat, and not catch fire.(3.) After drying the mask and killing most pathogens, give the masks a 1 hour bath of UV light. If you have more time, let them sit in a similar foil box of UV light for multiple hours. UV bulbs don't create much heat, so you can make an apparatus where the bulb is in the middle, and the masks circle the bulb.(4.) Reuse the filters as necessary.(I've already done this as a test. I used both my dryer and a red heat lamp used for bathrooms, and a UV light.
