No, it's an estimation made through mathematical models that carry with it assumptions of any given population. This is why R0 is always given in a range and not any one specific number.Imagine for a second, a person who contracts nCoV. He lives alone, and interacts with absolutely nobody. He stays at home and recovers, and during his infection he has infected absolutely no one. Does this mean that nCoV has an R0 of 0? No.Now imagine another scenario, someone who works as an escort. Let's assume this person has close contact with 20 people a day, and then by the time they exhibit symptoms and gets checked, they realize they have nCoV. Let's also assume this person has infected 50 people. Does this mean nCoV has an R0 of 50? No.R0 isn't an indication of how many people a vector of nCoV will infect during the span of its infection, but an estimation through assumptions of any given population including averages.

It makes sense for all organisations to have a plan of how to deal with one. Being well organised in advance will save lots of lives and reduce the need for panic. The more who prepare now the more who are able to look after their family and friends and be less of a burden on others if it gets bad.Then of course hopefully it won‚Äôt be bad but next time there is a pandemic flu we all know what to do.Sadly in UK people lose their shit when KFC runs out of chicken so I don‚Äôt have much hope for us.

For just a tickle in your throat the doctor will give you a ""Baja"", a note that is basically a prescription for rest and recovery that makes it illegal for bosses or schools to limit sick days or punish you for taking time off. This both drastically improves the chances of early detection, but also minimizes the possibility of spread in places like factories, offices, and schools.Thar the only cases occurred on islands/off the mainland seems odd... Until you realize that those islands are where 95% of British, German, and French tourists go, especially this time of year. I love living in Madrid, but it's landlocked, super professional (rather than touristy) and not nearly as scenic as the beaches and islands in the South. It actually makes sense that our cases showed up in our biggest tourist hubs rather than our biggest city.A third point is that, for some cultural reason, international travel is much less popular among Spanish people than Brits or Germans. People here love to travel within the country, and the culture from one town to the next is staggeringly different, as is the landscape. A lot of people don't see the reason to leave the country when they haven't explored their own equally or more dramatic and exotic landscapes and historical sites. Obviously this is a generalization, but I think it would also contribute to Spain having fewer residents out of the country/returning around Christmas time, as people almost exclusively travel to see family within the country. Just another reason that even in Spain our cases seemed to have jumped a greater number of hosts, from Wuhan to British tourists to folks in the Canaries.Finally, we have had some super intense sun and uncharacteristic heat over the last week and a half that, according to epidemiologists at WHO, severely limits the virus's ability to survive without a host. While 0 is a shockingly low number, I think it's really different from the suspected underreporting in Indonesia and Thailand, and much more likely to be a function of our tourism culture and incredible luck",Spain is now Coronavirus free,2020-02-15 03:44:18,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f48dbl/spain_is_now_coronavirus_free/

fjzxiwv,-0.8474,-0.1779,"I have followed closely since 24 January and read the transcript of a courageous lawyer who went to Wuhan, interviewed taxi drivers, went to 5 hospitals, interviewed and filmed the actual true state of things at the end of January. It was BAD. The govt. had ordered the taxi drivers to only transport supplies. People had to walk to hospitals. There were hospital parking lots flooded with sick people wanting to be tested. They were not allowed to be treated until they were tested. Each of the 6 hospitals (a man he interviewed had gone to all 6, gave up and went back home untreated) only had 300 kits or so. Do the math. Some kits had to be reserved for the medical staff. This whole time. The world has been told the # of confirmed cases. But Wuhan has 14 MILLION population. (5 Million were allowed to leave Wuhan before the govt. locked down the place.) (Gee. Where did those 5 million leave to after attending Wuhan‚Äôs attempt to break their record of most attendees for the New Year Banquet there? The leader of China knew of the outbreak but waited weeks to do anything. He let Wuhan try to break their record, so many tourists arrived in Wuhan to attend. It is unconscienable.) And that young lawyer with the drive to report the Real Facts first hand? He was taken away.  I hope he is still alive. But to answer your Q.  There were only 300 kits per hospital. There are multitudes that were turned away untreated, untested. Unfortunately, most of what I read between the lines from what I have sleuthed and logicked has unfolded.  I wish I had been wrong. The tone you hear in what I write is not arrogance; it is sheer frustration. They all knew. The WHO leader. They knew their goal was to not create panic. So they spoon-fed us ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù numbers while opting NOT to explain the ugly facts that hoards of sick people went uncounted due to a paucity of test kits. You know. IF.

fhorttn,0.6344,-0.3182,"Apologies in advance that I don‚Äôt often post to Reddit (in case if I miss any etiquettes...). This is from broadcast news in Taiwan, and since the video helped me go to sleep last night, I thought I‚Äôd share. I‚Äôve been following the news from US media, Reddit and Taiwan broadcasts for 2 weeks now and have observed that while there‚Äôs overlap, Taiwan news has been more updated and comprehensive. (Probably because they‚Äôre vigilant about this from having to fend for themselves in the face of Coronavirus, being excluded from the WHO). (And thank you for those of you that have created other Reddit posts on this topic, I‚Äôve really appreciated reading them)At 1:14:17 they discuss how China has shared footage and news of successfully treating 11 critically ill (nearly dead) patients by injecting them with blood plasma extracted from the blood of those recovered. 11 recovered out of how many dead was not shared. The news then shares a public notice in China encouraging those recovered to donate their blood for the greater good. They talk about the HIV drugs treat milder cases and this can treat severe cases.The video then goes on to discuss the ethics/morality and number of deaths behind creating such a solution, and the major quarantine camps being the perfect place for such human experiments to create and find the strongest antibody from those who survive the reinfections. Then using humans as hosts for breeding antibodies, that this could be the largest human experimentation since WWII. Also how this plan for a cure was enacted 1/20 for China to find vaccine, cure, specialty drugs for the coronavirus, and some suspicions that this was manmade virus.The majority of the video talks about other things. (Impact to Japan because they donated even some of their emergency reserves to China and now may be ill prepared for defending the coronavirus, how the cruise line inspections were handled in Taiwan and Japan for coronavirus, economic impact to China air travel and Asia as a whole, etc.)Rest of video (I will update this over the next few hours if there any interest as Mandarin is not my primary language)1:50 - Situation in Japan. Confirmed cases in different areas of Japan. They‚Äôre out of masks in stores as they sold / donated heavily to China, and they have a shortage in medical supplies as well (they‚Äôre a major producer). One death (80 year old woman), no community transmissions yet, but they are unable to find the source of transmission in one hospital. 9:21 Japan government took the initial advise of WHO and did not take additional precautions. Doctors also may have been overconfident in their medical system which lead the public and government to be under prepared. 10:06 talks about response to other disasters as an example of consensus driven decision making and how it has lead to slow response times.",11 patients in critical condition brought back to normal blood oxygen level,2020-02-15 04:45:20,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f48y9w/11_patients_in_critical_condition_brought_back_to/

fhoyeij,-0.992,0.3612,"If the anti vaccine people wont take it, they wont affect those that do because they got vaccinated.  The problem is that the vaccines they tried with SARS caused death when the animals were exposed to SARS again. I'm not so sure a vaccine is coming to that masses on the 1st try. Rumors fly around in situations like this so it's very difficult to know what the truth is. The antiviral medications tried in Wuhan seems to get people better but the rumor is that they can become infected again (which makes sense) but this time, they drop like flies (cumulative damage to the heart?). We dont know how long a person's system will remain immune after getting over the virus. It could be months, years or decades. I'm pretty sure than an antibiotic can be synthesized and mass produced but if each subsequent infection causes additional damage to the heart, lungs, testicles and kidneys, it seems that (if true) it's just delaying the inevitable.  So much we dont know and I do tend to speak from the worst case POV.  Most likely this viral outbreak will be somewhere in the middle of the extremes. A yearly vaccination may be needed or perhaps our immunity will last until a mutation occurs. My motto is that you prepare for the worst case and you'll be ready for any possible outcome. However,  I'm not as hopeful  that a global recession can be avoided along with this pandemic that leaves the poorest people vulnerable to losing everything.  That, I cannot prepare for. I'm a kind hearted person and want to help the helpless.  It would kill me to see an economic crisis affect people while they are fighting the outbreak. Some economic recession is almost guaranteed. How much is the question. I do hope that China gets it under control with their extreme measures.  Because if they dont, I cannot see how any other country would be able to stop the spread. I believe China will indeed slow the progression but my concern is what happens when everyone returns to work?  Are we in for a second wave when people return to work?

fhowaz9,-0.9891,-0.7506,"Unless you know how to start your own iv, you won‚Äôt be able to administer the drugs. The drugs you see are being administered IV. I‚Äôm not familiar with all the types of HIV drugs being used since everyone is being treated with different meds and methods. I‚Äôm only going off what is being reported since none of my hospitals have said anything about treating patients with covid-19. the saline drips you may have seen are used to ‚Äúpiggy back‚Äù meds which allows for steady infusion of drugs. Based on what I see in leaked hospital videos they‚Äôre using gravity feed IVs to control the flow since I‚Äôm betting that there‚Äôs limited amount of Electronic Iv pumps. When you have that many patients in the hospital, you have no choice! Here‚Äôs a story;We had trouble during Christmas one time when we ran out extra pumps because the hospital was so full. We were on a full diversion for our ER because we couldn‚Äôt handle any more patients! We had to redirect ambulances to other hospitals, but other hospitals were also full as well. We had no choice but to accept patients coming via ambulance. Those that walked into ER were seen last! I remember one of our ER charge nurses having to stand up on a chair in the ER lobby, and yell a message to the packed room. The message was for people to go home and go to urgent care in the morning. People would not be able to be seen for up to 10-12 hours or longer at the moment. That was only a guess. scary situation because the halls are packed and patients are like sardines. being that close to each other could cause spread of viruses easily. It was a very bad night and flu season was picking up quite a bit. this still happens to this day sometimes.  We‚Äôre already battling Common flu and other viruses in circulation. I can‚Äôt imagine covid-19 floating around, being as highly contagious as it is, adding fuel to this fire already. Those situations put everyone at risk because of the chaos. mistakes can be made when hospitals are over crowded. Oxygen topic:you can‚Äôt pump oxygen into the blood stream.This would kill you! This would be an air embolism  and would probably cause a severe stroke or heart attack.You have to inhale the pure oxygen thru a nasal cannula, or use a mask for more critical patients. A Cpap is a machine used to help force continuous flow of oxygen if needed. the next step critical step  after that is a ventilators. This means you blood/oxygen saturation is so low and you can‚Äôt breath on your own. To treat sever pneumonia you need ventilators. They are limited supply of these in hospitals. You‚Äôll probably be fully sedated, And intubated which is throwing that tube down your throat, and finally hooking you up to a machine that will breathe for you. having an oxygen saturation level of 97-98% is normal. Suggestion for people:You can buy a pulse oximeters on Amazon. This would be good to have for home. They‚Äôre cheap and I have one at my house when my son became lethargic, respiratory distressed  and passed out. He had an allergic reaction and I was able to quickly access him before proceeding to ER. Once you get pneumonia and start dipping to 92% or below, Md will have to prescribe oxygen if necessary. This is when you really start feeling that shortness of breath. My background: Nuclear Medicine, PET, CT, diagnostic Xray. These are my certs, I‚Äôve been working in the medical field over 15 years and currently working for 3 hospitals in California. hope this helps!",If all the hospital can do is administer oxygen and a fluid drip..... can‚Äôt the sick receive those treatments at their home?

fhowenl,0.982,-0.7506,"Disclaimer: Please note that I have a doctorate in a healthcare profession, but I am not a Physician or a Respiratory Therapist. People are requiring way more assistance than just slapping on an oxygen mask.Anytime you see someone in ‚Äúcritical‚Äù condition, assume that they need a ventilator or ecmo. Do a quick google search to learn about what those are and why they can‚Äôt be replicated at home.In addition, they are seeing some people (presumably the ones with significant underlying conditions) require dialysis due to kidney failure- more than likely due to their body not being able to process all the drugs they‚Äôre giving them.Now, what you CAN do for yourself and your family at home:- a nebulizer with steroids (can purchase OTC)- educate yourself of chest PT/ chest percussion and postural drainage (proven to help clear secretions, which can relieve a patient from a lot of the work load of coughing it all up, and allow their body to rest)- drink a TON of water. Increasing water intake thins secretions, which will make it easier to cough up. I‚Äôm not saying this is a replacement for the ICU, but it‚Äôs a start and if you‚Äôre a relatively healthy person it could help prevent you from getting to the point of needing ancillary assistance.- purchase a pulse oximeter- if your pulse ox is consistently below 88-90% at rest, it‚Äôs probably time to go to the hospital.  This part is important because if you‚Äôve ever had bronchitis or pneumonia you know that it FEELS like you can‚Äôt breathe.

In cases like this, if you simply could not get to a hospital, and had to stay home, the O2 concentrator might really help - because without it, you may be in a lot worse shape and not recover.

fhpdnq2,-0.9482,0.0,"I'm going to repeat here what I posted elsewhere: *What I don't see mentioned often but is a BIG issue is if you're a smoker. 50% of men in China smoke and smoking is a huge risk factor for the worse outcomes for Coronavirus, as it was for MERS. Early numbers show men are dying at 3x the rate of women in China. (*[*Stats here*](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-dangerous-smokers/)*.)*There is still so much to learn, but I think what is happening in China is unique to a very particular situation in China: high levels of pollution, high rates of smoking, and high population density. Other countries with these factors are going to get hit hard by this if it spreads. The US simply does not have the same high levels of pollution, smoking and density in most areas. We will know more in 30-60 days, but I suspect that the death rate for this virus is MUCH higher in China than it will be in other countries.Edit: Smoking rate is appx 17% for men in UK and US. Slightly lower for women. Based on the data, smoking will be a big factor for survivability of COVID-19.Edit2: There also appears to be research showing that ""O"" blood type is protective against coronaviruses, and O-types are in much shorter supply in Asian countries. Research about ""O"" protection [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4475644/). Search ""coronavirus"" to see the section that discusses it.

fhpjvcu,-0.9935,0.0,"Recovery percentage in the UK at this point doesn't mean much of anything other than if treated properly that it's not very deadly. The problem is how contagious it apparently is due to the long time before it shows.Death % when 9 people are infected and have 100% priority in care means little. The issue becomes what happens if 10k people are infected, or 30k people in 1 area and they don't get that same level or even adequate treatment because the medical staff is overwhelmed or they are constantly short on supplies..9 cases in UK with no real issues of access to treatment for the patients doesn't mean this will not be far more deadly if cases keep spiking and people aren't getting the right treatment.. Example as in China right now, there is very little chance with 67k people infected that their support staff can keep up.. Hence the reason the mortality rate is climbing..If they can't properly treat people because they are over worked, have no beds run out of supplies then people who probably should have lived will die.. Everything depends on containment and stopping the spread. Death tolls at this point are not the issues to focus on thinking it's not a biggie because it's low in places they aren't overwhelmed.. If they become overwhelmed the death rates will skyrocket..Think for just one moment the logistics of keeping just 10k people who are sick properly hydrated.. That in it's self is a nightmare.. If you are sick even with the flu and can't stay hydrated you will die.. So the virus isn't likely to be the cause of death for the majority it will be other things the virus caused to kill people..",8 of the 9 UK cases are now recovered!,2020-02-15 06:08:09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f49u9d/8_of_the_9_uk_cases_are_now_recovered/

It seems to be very contagious and likely many countries have cases who thought they just had a cold walking around infecting other. This is what makes it such a challenge to contain.

fhp0kv6,-0.9345,0.0,"Unpopular opinion: I will say mostly yes.Part of the reason why some Asian countries do not react so 'drastically', because we have often experience numerous contagious diseases (SARS, Dengue Fever, Bird Flu, Nipah Virus, MERS, Zika etc) sometimes even battling more than 1 infection concurrently, like how Taiwan is also battling H1N1 now and Singapore is trying to contain a rare emerging variant of Dengue Fever. So in the global stage, they are veterans in disease containment. So we already have protocol in place on how to properly react when new emerging diseases arrive on our shoes. This is like my third time experiencing a new disease outbreak? Not including the yearly/seasonal concern of dengue fever or hand foot mouth disease.Secondly, so far in last 50 years or so other than H1N1 and to a certain extent 'measles', Western countries have never been badly impact by new emerging diseases. Hence, it might be difficult for the general public to know what is expected when dealing with a localised outbreaks. Furthermore, Western media tend to play into our fears and hype up things because of ratings. This is a commentary towards American healthcare system, your system is shit. Governments in Singapore and South Korea, (Japan has free universal healthcare) has publicly announced they will foot the bill with anyone who is infected. This helps to encourage people who might be carrying the virus to come forward instead of worrying about costs, risking further infection. Oh they have sick leaves too. If someone is sick in America, they quite likely gonna delay seeking help due to cost. CDC has signaled if an outbreak happens in their soil, containment might be impossible.Lastly, this based on anecdotal evidences, a large number of threads I have seen in r/coronavirus and r/China_flu is asking I live in xxx American/British city, should I be concern and start wearing mask now? Or I saw an Asian cough should be worried?

fhpt0du,0.9697,0.7506,"I think you are on to something here, absolutely. It is numbers, and likely some of the numbers are here. They just haven‚Äôt been tested.    I work in a trauma hospital in a major California city. I can tell you they are quietly preparing an ICU wing for CoVid 19. They are fitting certain frontline healthcare workers with N95‚Äôs; but sadly you only get 1 mask. This hospital can‚Äôt get enough to supply at this point, to allow us to trash each mask after use. Let that sink in a moment. Many people just don‚Äôt grasp how undersupplied all the hospitals are to protect workers; which in turn protects other patients. And those of us who have been paying attention already know that N95 is really not very effective anyway- health care workers should be in Paprs. Our hospital is already at a ‚Äúcritically overcrowded‚Äù state. Just imagine what an epicenter here would do. There are not enough resources or personnel to deal with the scale of this. The way I see it we have 4-5 epicenters officially going right now, with Whuhan, Japan, Hong Kong, cruise ship, and Singapore. There will be more. I know that is painful for those with cognitive dissonance. But please don‚Äôt‚Äô just push it away out of fear or discomfort. There are things you can do!   In terms of staying in and taking extra precautions, yes really we all should do to the fullest extent that we can social distance. It is a completely  foreign concept to our American way of life- but hey, couldn‚Äôt the ‚Äú American Way of Life‚Äù use some evolving???    For our precautions at home we mask up for shopping or have it delivered. We exercise in the house- yes boo, but better than nothing. When we get home from work at the hospital we strip our clothes and shoes at the door in a garbage bag, sanitize our hands, and go right to the shower with hiebeclenz. This virus travels by air and fomites, so we try not to bring the fomites in. Is this overkill? Perhaps, but remember when you start hearing about a lot of cases in your community-you have already been exposed and exposed others. Be brave and dare to do the different thing!

They are able to create quarantine areas quickly should the need arise, and many around here already have plans they are beginning to put into action. Our medical system is able to cope with an initial influx of infections much better than the Chinese hospitals could with their lack of resources and greater population density. They won't be able to handle it forever if it rages out of control, but if we can slow the spread through social distancing and proper hygiene, we SHOULD be able to handle the first large waves of patients without being completely overwhelmed like in China (assuming it even gets a foothold here).   China's response to the situation does make it look like a doomsday scenario, but I think that has more to do with the fact they want to maintain power and control over their people when this is all over and done.","Health care workers in hospitals and clinics, please let me know what your facility is doing to prepare here in US.",2020-02-15 11:17:42,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4e56z/health_care_workers_in_hospitals_and_clinics/

Not even close. But I do understand your perspective, because as an American I would say i feel similarly about the coronavirus and the Yemen civil war. I think that's kind of the perspective you have as an outsider of both countries is that all disasters are just lumped together**The difference is this:**Even if the virus hits hard in the US, we will never feel the same about that as about 9/11. We will just get through the virus and then go on with life after it's finally gone. It wouldn't have the far reaching ramifications. I would compare the coronavirus in China to something like Hurricane Katrina in America. It's still something we all remember, but it doesn't evoke nearly the same feeling for most of us as 9/11 does9/11 is not something you just moved on from. It changed the way of life in the United States permanently. It put us into a way which we are still involved in as it has evolved over the years. I want you to remember that the number of people who died on one day in this country was over 3k. That's twice the number of people who have died total from the virus so far. We had no clue what had just hit us. We're living life and all of a sudden planes are crashing everywhere, destroying the largest buildings in New York City. Hitting the Pentagon. People were jumping out of windows. People all over the country had no idea what was happening. Were we being invaded? Were there going to be more attacks? Was someone you know there and were they ok? New York City was basically a war zone for the people who were there.

fhqd1hs,-0.8782,0.3612,"Airborne transmission generally refers to very small particle sizes (perhaps even fully dehydrated) that stay adrift on air currents for hours or days.Aerosol transmission generally refers to aerosol droplets generated by a cough or sneeze. Being heavier, they generally settle to the ground in minutes.Most respiratory viruses are transmitted by aerosols. (coughs and sneezes)  In such a mode of transmission, the newly infected are assumed to have had to been in close proximity to the transmitter.If this virus is transmissible by an airborne route, then the newly infected patient never needs to be in close proximity to the transmitter, and in fact may randomnly inhale the virus during routine activity when no one else is around.The Chinese have come to believe that airborne transmission is a problem, and have taken to fogging all major cities with aerosol disinfectant daily, in order to accumulate suspended viral particles on droplets and cause them to settle.Whether the Chinese are correct or not is uncertain. However, the fogging is a costly nuisance, and one would presume the Chinese have confirmed airborne transmission. Probably by air sampling.I should note that airborne transmission could explain another peculiar fact of this epidemic. That being, unusually long incubation times.If the virus is acquired by aerosol, the viral load inhaled is presumably higher, and would result in a relatively short incubation time, so the patient would show symptoms quicker.If the virus is acquired by airborne transmission, the viral load inhaled may be only one or two particles. This would create the opportunity to very long incubation times, and patients might remain asymptomatic for weeks.This may also have some bearing on the complaints about the sensitivity of testing.",I‚Äôd like to discuss the possibility of ‚Äúairborne‚Äù transmission.,2020-02-15 13:00:26,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4fmx3/id_like_to_discuss_the_possibility_of_airborne/

Energy drink colour pee)Drop the booze if you were chronically drinking it like I was until Tuesday. Chronic alcohol use increases the inflammatory response which would in theory increase the response to lung infection by causing pneumonia. Oddly enough, acute alcohol use decreases the inflammatory response but you shouldn't be drinking if you're really sick anyhow. Drop smoking. Even the mary-jane. Get the gum, patch, whatever. Do it now and give your lungs time to heal.Fresh fruits and veggies with dinner.  Lots of variety.Get a full night's sleep if you can. This one is most important. Underslept people suffer more bugs seasonally.Drop as much processed food as possible. Sucrose (sugar) enhances inflammation which you want to reduce. The liver has to process sucrose for you whereas glucose is simply absorbed. I know it's delicious.Get a bit of cardio but not enough to stress your system so that you get sick, obviously. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk to the grocery store. Don't bother getting a gym membership because those places are always lousy with whatever cold bug is going around.Do breathing exercises to bolster your lung function: (like a COPD patient would)Purse your lips like duckface and breathe slowly through them .. the resistance will help you work your diaphragm. Do this when you can and when it doesn't look ridiculous.Pushups are good for chest muscles.Just live clean for a while. I know id rather be drunk off my ass right now with all of the uncertainty. I fucking love that warm blanket of a good drinking session. But I was doing it nightly. Giving myself a little edge to keep me out of the hospital is more important than feeling awesome and drunk. In 42.

fhqt2n8,0.9935,0.296,"If you overactivate your immune system , it would make you susceptible to autoimmune diseases . And if you have weak immune system then that can also cause sickness and disease . I believe that an immune system that is functioning better then an unactive immune system but not overactivated is the perfect immune system . However most people today have either overactivated  immune system  due to wrong supplements and medications or a weak immune system due to overeating junk food , being overweight and having an inactive lifestyle .                          Therefore I would suggest you to not overindulge on wrong supplements but rather take the appropriate ones and also start going to gym,exercising,maintain ideal bodyweight to height and start eating healthier . The supplement that I suggest is Vitamin D3 (10000iu) which has the ability to modulate innate and adaptive immune response which means that it helps prevents flu and viruses. Taking vitamin d3 in high doses prevents overactivation of immune system. Exclusively for vitamin D3 it's better to have higher then normal level ( Target = Between 60ng/ml to 80ng/ml ) Take vitamin k2 with vitamin D3 so that calcium deposits to your bones , and not arteries , therefore preventing hypercalcemia. Check the coimbra protocol on google which explains miraculous benefit of supplementing high vitamin D3 dosage to prevent autoimmune diseases .

TL;DR: This receptor is more prevalent in Asian populations less prevalent but still existent in European and African populations.  While the virus will no doubt infect Europeans and Africans -- the fewer prevalence of ACE2 means less damage to affected tissue (less severe cases and therefore possibly fewer deaths).  Here is a paper here talks about the mechanism of Covid19 binding to the ACE2 receptor. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.919985v1.full.pdf+htmlBelow are genetic markers that are known to positively influence the amount of ACE2-expressing cells and their population distributions.https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs233575 East Asian A=1.00 African A=0.988 South Asian A=0.82 American A=0.79 Europe A=0.66https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs714205 East Asian G=0.54 South Asian G=0.47 American G=0.30 Europe G=0.20 African G=0.101http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs1978124 East Asian C=0.99 African C=0.900 South Asian C=0.78 American C=0.71 Europe C=0.53http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs879922 East Asian G=0.96 South Asian G=0.71 American G=0.72 Europe G=0.65 African G=0.454http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs2048683 East Asian G=0.99 African G=0.807 South Asian G=0.80 American G=0.75 Europe G=0.65http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs1877752 East Asian C=0.98 South Asian C=0.71 American C=0.71 Europe C=0.64 African C=0.453All these add up to the chart here:https://twitter.com/HarmlessYardDog/status/1223275121403662337/photo/1While I await more studies to be published on this, I think what we have is convincing enough to conjecture that the most at risk patients will be East Asians as they express the most ACE2 in their tissues/cells (more cells means more places for the virus to replicate).  while Europeans and Africans the least (or closer to 50%) so they will exhibit milder symptoms letting their immune systems fight off the infectin.This doesn't mean that Europeans won't get sick after being infected. But probabilistic-ally speaking the infection will most likely not be as devastating in European/African cases as in East Asian cases.  In East Asian cases, we are seeing hospital stays past 3rd week of infection, and in those really serious cases needing oxygen feeds.  In Wuhan those who stay home without this oxygen feed or hospital care definitely die.Therefore I conjecture that for European populations this disease will be more mild like the Standard Flu -- while for East Asian populations it will be much more serious to  very deadly especially when the hospitals overwhelm.  We won't know until we see more European cases.   But anecdotally -- so far all of the european cases have recovered including that Ms. Fraser (american) on the cruise liner in Japan, the superspreader scouts leader guy from the UK, and the Belgium guy who worked in Wuhan and showed no symptoms.",Pentagon to extend availability of 4 military bases to help with coronavirus efforts: official,2020-02-15 15:17:09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4hkj7/pentagon_to_extend_availability_of_4_military/

I am by no means saying it is not useful in regards to them understanding biological function but ACE2 receptors play a large role in cardiac, renal and GI function and yet the papers on focus on the lungs; there is not enough data on % of ace 2 receptors (in differing races) to come to a conclusion, however you might find this interesting: https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BYF1Provides alot of referenced information regarding SARS and ACE2",Pentagon to extend availability of 4 military bases to help with coronavirus efforts: official,2020-02-15 15:17:09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4hkj7/pentagon_to_extend_availability_of_4_military/

fhr652g,-0.9898,0.0,"Full article:To Tame Coronavirus, Mao-Style Social Control Blankets ChinaDespite their high-tech tools, the authorities are mainly relying on a flood of workers to keep hundreds of millions of people from coming in contact with outsiders.SHANGHAI ‚Äî China has flooded cities and villages with battalions of neighborhood busybodies, uniformed volunteers and Communist Party representatives to carry out one of the biggest social control campaigns in history.The goal: to keep hundreds of millions of people away from everyone but their closest kin.The nation is battling the coronavirus outbreak with a grass-roots mobilization reminiscent of Mao-style mass crusades not seen in China in decades, essentially entrusting front line epidemic prevention to a supercharged version of a neighborhood watch.Housing complexes in some cities have issued the equivalents of paper hall passes to regulate how often residents leave their homes. Apartment buildings have turned away their own tenants if they have come from out of town. Train stations block people from entering cities if they cannot prove they live or work there. In the countryside, villages have been gated off with vehicles, tents and other improvised barriers.Despite China‚Äôs arsenal of high-tech surveillance tools, the controls are mainly enforced by hundreds of thousands of workers and volunteers, who check residents‚Äô temperature, log their movements, oversee quarantines and ‚Äî most important ‚Äî keep away outsiders who might carry the virus.Residential lockdowns of varying strictness ‚Äî from checkpoints at building entrances to hard limits on going outdoors ‚Äî now cover at least 760 million people in China, or more than half the country‚Äôs population, according to a New York Times analysis of government announcements in provinces and major cities. Many of these people live far from the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first reported and which the government sealed off last month.Throughout China, neighborhoods and localities have issued their own rules about residents‚Äô comings and goings, which means the total number of affected people may be even higher. Policies vary widely, leaving some places in a virtual freeze and others with few strictures.China‚Äôs top leader, Xi Jinping, has called for an all-out ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs war‚Äù to tame the outbreak. But the restrictions have prevented workers from returning to factories and businesses, straining China‚Äôs giant economy. And with local officials exercising such direct authority over people‚Äôs movements, it is no surprise that some have taken enforcement to extremes.Li Jing, 40, an associate professor of sociology at Zhejiang University in the eastern city of Hangzhou, was almost barred from taking her husband to a hospital recently after he choked on a fish bone during dinner. The reason? Her neighborhood allows only one person per family to leave the house, every other day.‚ÄúOnce the epidemic was disclosed, the central government put huge pressure on local officials,‚Äù Professor Li said. ‚ÄúThat triggered competition between regions, and local governments turned from overly conservative to radical.‚Äù‚ÄúEven when the situation is relieved or if the mortality rate turns out not to be high, the government machine is unable to change direction or tune down,‚Äù she added.China‚Äôs prevention efforts are being led by its myriad neighborhood committees, which typically serve as a go-between for residents and the local authorities. Supporting them is the government‚Äôs ‚Äúgrid management‚Äù system, which divides the country into tiny sections and assigns people to watch over each, ensuring a tight grip over a large population.Zhejiang Province, on China‚Äôs southeastern seaboard, has a population of nearly 60 million and has enlisted 330,000 ‚Äúgrid workers.‚Äù Hubei Province, whose capital is Wuhan, has deployed 170,000. The southern province of Guangdong has called upon 177,000, landlocked Sichuan has 308,000 and the megacity of Chongqing has 118,000The authorities are also combining enormous manpower with mobile technology to track people who may have been exposed to the virus. China‚Äôs state-run cellular providers allow subscribers to send text messages to a hotline that generates a list of provinces they have recently visited.At a high-speed rail station in the eastern city of Yiwu this past week, workers in hazmat suits demanded that passengers send the text messages that show their location data before being allowed to leave.An app developed by a state-run maker of military electronics lets Chinese citizens enter their name and national ID number and be told whether they may have come in contact, on a plane, train or bus, with a carrier of the virus.It is too early to say whether China‚Äôs strategy has contained the outbreak. With large numbers of new infections being reported every day, the government has clear reasons for minimizing human contact and domestic travel. But experts say that in epidemics, overbearing measures can backfire, scaring infected people into hiding and making the outbreak harder to control.‚ÄúPublic health relies on public trust,‚Äù said Alexandra L. Phelan, a specialist in global health law at Georgetown University. ‚ÄúThese community-level quarantines and the arbitrary nature in which they‚Äôre being imposed and tied up with the police and other officials is essentially making them into punitive actions ‚Äî a coercive action rather than a public health action.‚ÄùIn Zhejiang, one of China‚Äôs most developed provinces and home to Alibaba and other technology companies, people have written on social media about being denied entry to their own apartments in Hangzhou, the provincial capital. Coming home from out of town, they say, they were asked to produce documents from landlords and employers or be left on the street.For Nada Sun, who was visiting family in Wenzhou, a coastal city in Zhejiang, a health scare turned into a mandatory quarantine.When Ms. Sun, 29, complained of tightness in her chest this month, her mother told her to go to the hospital. She did not have a high fever, yet the hospital gave her a battery of checks. All came back negative for the virus.Even so, when she returned to her apartment, she was told that she would be quarantined for two weeks. She was also added to a group on the WeChat messaging app with a local Communist Party secretary and other volunteers in which she has to submit her temperature and location twice a day.‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried they have too much information,‚Äù Ms. Sun said.The lockdowns are not necessarily oppressive. Many people in China have been happy to wall themselves off, ordering groceries online and working from home if they can. Some neighborhood officials act with a humane touch.Bob Huang, a Chinese-born American living in northern Zhejiang, said the volunteers at his complex had helped chase down a man who stayed out overnight to drink, in violation of rules about how often people can step outside. Yet they also delivered food from McDonald‚Äôs to a quarantined family.Mr. Huang, 50, has been able to dodge the restrictions by using a special pass from the property manager, and he has been driving around delivering protective face masks to friends. Some building complexes don‚Äôt let him in. Others take down his information.A nearby village took a less orthodox approach.‚ÄúThey always start asking questions in the local dialect, and if you can respond in the local dialect, you are allowed to go in,‚Äù Mr. Huang said. Unable to speak the dialect, he had to wait, though the villagers were friendly. They gave him a folding chair, offered him a cigarette and didn‚Äôt ask for an ID.Some parts of China have imposed other, often severe policies for fending off the epidemic.Hangzhou has barred pharmacies from selling analgesics to force people with symptoms to seek treatment at hospitals. The eastern city of Nanjing requires anybody who takes a cab to show ID and leave contact information. Yunnan Province wants all public places to display QR codes that people must scan with their phones whenever they enter or exit.Many places have banned large gatherings. The police in Hunan Province this month destroyed a mahjong parlor where they found more than 20 people playing the tile game.With local governments deciding such policies largely on their own, China has become a vast patchwork of fiefs.‚ÄúIt can be quite haphazard,‚Äù said Zhou Xun, a historian of modern China at the University of Essex in England. ‚ÄúA perfect plan on paper often turns into makeshift solutions locally.‚ÄùOfficials seem to recognize that some local authorities have gone too far. This month, Chen Guangsheng, the deputy secretary general of Zhejiang‚Äôs provincial government, called it ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù that some places had employed ‚Äúsimple and crude practices,‚Äù like locking people into their homes to enforce quarantines.National officials on Saturday urged towns and villages to remove unnecessary roadblocks and ensure the smooth transport of food and supplies.Zhang Yingzi‚Äôs apartment complex in Hangzhou initially forbade anybody who had been out of town from entering. Later, the ban was adjusted to cover only people coming from Hubei Province and the Zhejiang cities of Wenzhou and Taizhou, both of which have had many cases of the new virus.‚ÄúBanning everyone from out of town wasn‚Äôt realistic,‚Äù said Ms. Zhang, 29, an accountant. ‚ÄúThere are so many of them, after all. Some needed to come back for work.‚ÄùStill, many in China are uneasy about loosening up virus controls too quickly.Zhang Shu, 27, worries that her parents and neighbors are becoming cavalier about the virus, even as workers drive around her village near Wenzhou with loudspeakers telling people to stay home.‚ÄúOrdinary people are slowly starting to feel that the situation isn‚Äôt so horrible anymore,‚Äù Ms. Zhang said. ‚ÄúThey are restless.‚Äù",760 million people under lockdown,2020-02-15 16:20:16,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4if37/760_million_people_under_lockdown/

Unfortunately, that doesn't help much, since the virus is about 0.125 microns. On the positive side, the droplets and particles that the virus tends to be attached to are much bigger, more than 10 microns in a cough or sneeze. N95 filters these larger particles easily. Also, the settling velocity of 10 micron droplets is about 20 cm/min, so after 15 minutes, the vast majority will have reached the ground.

fhrhvt7,0.9289,0.0,"Lots of content here.  Great video, high production value.  More alarmist than most anything in the American press right now.A couple of takeaways as follows: He suggests high probability that COVID-19 will infect a similar pop. to that of the common flu, annually, up to 20% (roughly) of those individuals asymptomatic along with 40%-65% (roughly) individuals showing symptoms and many of those very mild.  His point here being that an overwhelming percent of a pop. will be infected with flu on any given year with high percent recovering/fighting off the infection without substantial fuss.By my reading, he is giving a very direct warning that this virus is likely to spread similarly to the flu and likely cannot be contained.  He calmly states that the mortality rates, in his view, though yet unknown, are likely to be \~4% (might have said 2-4%).  He also believes that there are likely 3-4x as many infected outside of the hotzone as currently known, assuming due to incubation and asymptomatic individuals.  Dr. Ferguson is very careful in his statements but seems strong in the assumption that mortality rates will be much higher than the flu.His explicit instruction to societies like the US and those of Europe is to prepare/mobilize resources accordingly (implied per percentage requiring hospitalization or ICU-level care) with the expectation of a growth of symptomatic cases to unfold over the coming year.",Neil Ferguson and his team updates us on coronavirus spread.,2020-02-15 18:19:17,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4jybo/neil_ferguson_and_his_team_updates_us_on/

She said hospitals were ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù by demand to keep up with tests, with nurses being warned that they may have to test people in their homes in future.¬†On Thursday, the head of NHS England Sir Simon Stevens warned that¬†many more people may be forced to self-isolate as part of efforts to stop Coronavirus spreading¬†in Britain.Prof Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College, has warned that the world is ‚Äúin the early phases of a global pandemic‚Äù.¬†¬†He said Britain is probably only picking up around one in three cases, focusing on those coming in to the country, when cases may have arrived - and gone undetected - before restrictions set in.‚ÄúSurveillance has started in hospitals across the UK of pneumonia cases, that will give us a proper picture,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúOur best estimate is that transmission in the UK will get going in the next few weeks; unless we are very lucky probably peaking 2 to 3 months after that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf it truly establishes itself in terms of true person-to-person transmission it will behave like a flu pandemic, maybe up to 60 percent of the population being affected but most of those people having very mild symptoms.‚ÄùHe suggested that 400,000 people in the UK could die from it in the next 12 months, based on estimates of a 1 per cent mortality rate and an infection rate of 60 percent of the population.The 80-year-old Chinese man who died from the virus in France flagged himself up to doctors soon after arriving in France on January 16, but they initially failed to recognise his symptoms as the Covid-19 Coronavirus.¬†The man had been receiving treatment in the Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital, northern Paris. His daughter is also in hospital but French authorities say she is likely to make a good recovery.¬†In Portsmouth the Kingston Crescent Surgery became the latest to shut for deep cleaning until further notice on Friday after a woman suspected to have the virus walked in after falling ill.The woman is said to have felt unwell some time after arriving in Britain at Gatwick Airport.The closure is the latest to hit a string of surgeries and health centres around the country, including Islington in north London and Taunton in Somerset, after being attended by patients with suspected Coronavirus.At the same time the last of those quarantined at Arrowe Park, in the Wirral, after returning from China have now been allowed home.Mr Walsh, a 53-year-old Scout leader from Hove in East Sussex, contracted Coronavirus on a business trip to Singapore and on his way back stopped off at a ski resort in France, where five other Britons were subsequently infected.In a statement the group, who were treated at the Royal Free Hospital and St Thomas' Hospital in London, said: ""All of our group, including the six in other countries, have recovered quickly from the virus having required minimal medical treatment during our time in isolation.""We understand the virus can be dangerous for some, but we also want to share the important facts of our situation to help reassure people.""Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ‚ÄúI am pleased that 8 of the 9 individuals who tested positive for Coronavirus have now been successfully treated and discharged from hospital. Again, this is evidence of how well prepared our NHS is to deal with the Wuhan Coronavirus.¬†‚ÄúI want to stress that any individuals who are discharged from hospital are now well and do not pose any public health risk to the public.‚Äù",Exclusive: Millions to be told 'stay at home' if coronavirus continues to spread,2020-02-15 18:22:52,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4jzuw/exclusive_millions_to_be_told_stay_at_home_if/

It‚Äôs not just the direct effect, it‚Äôs also the panic, the overload, and the things that effect health workers, because you‚Äôre already at very limited capacity.‚ÄúThis disease, if it‚Äôs in Africa it‚Äôs more dramatic than if it‚Äôs in China, even though I‚Äôm not trying to minimise what‚Äôs going on in China in any way.‚ÄùBritish experts said it was unsurprising that the disease had reached Egypt because Cairo was a world hub and had a lot of visitors from China.They said it was encouraging that the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) were¬†¬†working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and African Member States to improve diagnosis and surveillance.The patient was isolated quickly and people who had been in contact all tested negative.However other experts warned that the limited health services in Africa may mean it is already in other countries undetected.¬†Dr Andrew Freedman, Reader in Infectious Diseases and Honorary¬†Consultant Physician, Cardiff University School of Medicine, said: ‚ÄúIt was always inevitable that the virus would spread to the African continent. ¬†‚ÄúIndeed there may well already be more cases in other African countries that have evaded detection. ¬†‚ÄúThe concern is that it may prove impossible to contain the spread of COVID-19 in developing countries with less robust health systems; ¬†this, in turn, could lead to wider global spread.‚Äù¬†Dr Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health, University of Southampton, added: ‚ÄúThere have been concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak when it arrives in Africa. Therefore, it is reassuring that there has been some rapid contact tracing and all contacts have tested negative.¬†‚ÄúThis gives confidence that this might be an isolated case with minimal transmission.‚Äù",Coronovirus: Bill Gates warns of 10 million deaths as virus spreads to Africa,2020-02-15 18:28:58,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4k2kh/coronovirus_bill_gates_warns_of_10_million_deaths/

Washing your hands, not touching your face, getting good sleep, taking vitamins (C and D for immune support), and exercising regularly all combined with a healthy and balanced diet go a long way in strengthening your immune system defenses.Personally for preparedness, I'm currently putting together a small survival kit and stashing away non-perishable foods. The kit took some time and cash to assemble (I had nothing, not even a pocket knife) but as for food I've been purchasing a bit of extra non-perishables each week my fiance and I go shopping. Things like rice, dried beans, canned food, bottled water, etc. My goal is to stock a small plastic tote with enough food, water, and toiletries to last 30-60 days. This is to prepare for unlikely yet still possible: forced quarantines, extreme supply chain disruption, and/or to get ahead of late-to-the-game panic buyers.On a mildly unrelated note - while walking through stores today and picking up a few extra items for our bug-out bags I took note of everything I found that was ""Made in China"". It's everything. The items I did find that were ""Made in America"" or ""Made in USA"" were all significantly more expensive. Much of the items (especially knives) seemed to be of much higher quality... problem is they weren't affordable and won't be for most.We always joke about how China owns us but if goods stop coming from over there because of some (unlikely) Chinese financial collapse then the US is going to be in some dire straights. I'd rather be prepared in case that happens and we're all forced to live a bit ""less"" for awhile. Of course it's very unlikely but ""better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it"" is a credence that has served me well in the past.

We also have the ability to rapidly isolate patients and slow the infection down. That isn't to say we won't see epidemics happening, we likely will. But we will also likely be able to get them under control pretty quickly as well. When people are aware a virus is spreading in their community, they tend to take precautions to avoid catching the virus. Wearing masks, hand sanitizer, washing hands, avoiding crowds, taking temperature, staying inside etc. These things can basically starve a virus out and reduce the transmission rate by a lot. Poorer countries and countries without advanced disease control methods cant do this as easily. The USA obviously can.

Our communities are socially anti-social - except for a few of the large cities (NYC, Chicago, LA, Philly, etc.) our society is very spread out (cars not public transportation) and transmission of the disease should be slower. Slower transmission allows for a lower strain on healthcare (a slow regular trickle of patients vs a Chinese Wuhan +1000 patients every day), increased lessons learned because 'everyone else' got it first, and strong logistics and inter-governmental connections, which can lead to more rapid responses, as well as a general capacity for freedom of information,  result in higher patient survival (on the personal and community level) and an overall healthy outcome.

fhrsuth,-0.9798,-0.2023,"Full Text :British passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise liner, where hundreds have tested positive for coronavirus, have pleaded with the UK Government to to evacuate them after the US, Canada and Hong Kong announced they would move their citizens off the ship.David Abel, who is among the 78 Britons stuck on the ship since February 3, said that he feels ""completely overlooked, neglected and forgotten"" and asked the Government: ""Don‚Äôt you want your people home? I‚Äôve never felt less loved by my own country than right now.‚ÄùIn a Facebook post on Sunday he said: ""Can I tell you, UK, how this makes me really feel? If feels like we have been forgotten, that you don‚Äôt really care about us and that you don‚Äôt really want us to come home.‚ÄùJapan confirmed yesterday that the number of people aboard infected with the coronavirus is now 355, up by 70 in the past 24 hours.On Friday, the US embassy in Tokyo sent a message telling their citizens on board that a chartered plane would arrive this evening in Japan, and recommended they disembarked ""out of an abundance of caution"" and return home.They are expected to undergo a further quarantine of 14 days upon arrival at a US military base in California. Hong Kong and Canada announced on Saturday that they would also repatriate its citizens.The move has left the Britons on board furious at the prospect of being left on the Diamond Princess to endure their continued quarantine. Speaking via a live link from the ship, Mr Abel, 74, said: ""All us Brits are going to have to do our own thing. It's wonderful how the Americans are going to come and take them home ... but nothing is happening for UK passengers.""We feel that we've been completely overlooked, neglected, forgotten.Our greatest fear is that we'll be split up.""His wife Sally said: ""Everything's very quiet with the UK. Nobody's actually talking to us.""The couple from Oxfordshire said they had no official communication from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), beyond two instances from Phil Madden, the UK ambassador to Japan. ""But he's not telling us what he'll do for us,"" said Mr Abel.Alan Steele, another British passenger on the ship, posted on Facebook that the confinement was a risk to the passengers' mental health.‚ÄúI think it is about time boris got the brits back to england as the japanese are being totally incompetent and do not realise you cannot keep ppl in solitary confinement for 28 days without damaging their mental health,"" Mr Steele posted. ""What does WHO have to say about this and I am sure cruel punishment like this has to be illegal.‚ÄùIt is understood the Government is examining possible evacuation and repatriation options, including joining flights arranged by other countries, and is contacting British passengers and crew on the ship.An FCO spokesman said: ""We are urgently speaking to authorities in Japan and the UK. We are working around the clock to ensure the welfare of the British nationals on board.""According to Japanese health officials, those onboard who tested positive for the virus were transferred to hospitals.At least three Britons tested positive and were receiving treatment.Coronavirus, which originated in central China, has infected more than 68,500 people globally, the vast bulk of them in China, killing 1,600. The largest number of cases outside China have been on the Diamond Princess. The ship, which has 3,500 passengers and crew, was quarantined upon arrival in Yokohama, 20 miles south of Tokyo, on Feb 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong, before it headed for Japan, was diagnosed with the virus.Meanwhile, 1,500 people on board the MS Westerdam were allowed to disembark in Cambodia after five countries denied it a berth despite health screenings showing no symptoms of the virus. Passengers were welcomed ashore by Hun Sen, the prime minister, who handed them flowers.A World Health Organisation-led joint investigation in China due to start this weekend will focus on the severity of Coronavirus and how it has spread.It emerged that an 80-year-old Chinese man who died from the virus in France - the first death in Europe - had flagged himself up to doctors soon after arriving in France on Jan 16, but they initially failed to recognise his symptoms as the Covid-19 coronavirus.The man had been receiving treatment in the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, in northern Paris. His daughter was also taken to hospital but the French authorities said she was likely to make a good recovery.His death was announced by Agn√®s Buzyn, the French health minister. She added that there was ""no cause for concern"" about the condition of the other six coronavirus patients in French hospitals, including five Britons.All were expected to make a full recovery, according to medical sources.Another four coronavirus patients were discharged from French hospitals with a clean bill of health, Ms Buzyn said.The minister was due to hold a meeting with health professionals on Tuesday to discuss how to stem the spread of the virus. ""We must prepare our health system to cope with a possible pandemic and the circulation of the virus in our country,"" she said.","Coronavirus: Get us off infected Diamond Princess, plead Britons",2020-02-15 23:12:40,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4n87g/coronavirus_get_us_off_infected_diamond_princess/
