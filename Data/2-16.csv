Breathe, find your center, allow the fear to roll over you, and when it is gone, you will remain.A boss of mine once drilled into me the saying that ""nobody rises to the occasion. We all fall to our level of preparation.""In that spirit, prepare yourself. Sleep well, eat healthily, exercise regularly, wash your hands, avoid unnecessary public gatherings, and don't touch your face.Beyond that, most of us are not in a position to need to do more yet.

Well, how many of the worlds goods come from China?

So we will definitely see a shortage of goods and or marked up here very very soon I believe. Or it could all be BS so China can charge more for their products but I highly doubt it. I always keep every possibility in my mind. I feel ALOT better I have prepped all medical supplies medicines etc for health.

fhs4z67,0.9145,0.0,"There's a training mentality that's really hard to derail for any reason with distance runners.  If you've fully trained for a full marathon, not completing the race you've registered for for *any* reason, including illness and injury, is tantamount to quitting mid-competition -- something no distance runner considers very easily, & usually not voluntarily.  A broken bone will stop you... but not torn muscles, pulled tendons, asthma attacks, twisted ankles, vomiting repeatedly, passing out, even sprains & the like.  Many will rest a minute and continue. Runners re-injure themselves all the time rather than rest & heal properly.  It's self-defeating and obsessive, to be sure.  There's also the possibility that for such a large, popular destination race as this one, there are runners from all over the world, many of whom have specific goals for this race, such as breaking certain personal best records of time, races on every continent/in every country, number of marathons in a certain time frame, racing with friends/family/training partners.

In Canada we've had 8 cases among people of Asian-ethnicity, but they were all mild except for one elderly woman who is still in hospital requiring treatment. However, estimates based on projection by John Hopkins U suggests 18% get serious complications. That means we've not yet seen enough cases in North America yet to expect many cases that lead to more severe symptoms. If severity of symptoms was explained by race, then we might expect to see more serious complications among the Asians infected in Canada, the US, elsewhere when the numbers start creeping up a bit more. But if it has more to do with secondary infection, and right now there are lots of secret spreaders who are asymptomatic, or who have such mild symptoms they don't realize they're carrying this and contagious, then we should expect maybe a 6-8 week delay before people start getting reinfected, I'm guessing. So at the moment people are getting their first infection. Few need hospitalization because of lower smoking rates, less air-pollution, better basic health & hygiene, etc. So it's spreading under the radar of health authorities. But in another 2 months, if secondary infection does in fact cause worse symptoms, then everyone will be thanking you for getting them to buy supplies. In any case, supply-chain disruptions will occur in the West either way, so those who stocked up on meds will be grateful to you. I think the theory of worse symptoms during re-infection might help to explain the wide range noted as the ""incubation period"". One woman was found to have had a 42-day incubation period before showing symptoms. Perhaps more likely that she was infected, had such mild symptoms she didn't really think about it, and then was reinfected 3-4 weeks later, and ended up being hospitalized. We'll find out in the next 6 weeks, either way, I believe.   But never feel silly for caring about people enough to want to make sure they have what they need to survive, in case of a catastrophe. You're a good man, and they should love you for that.","Feeling like an idiot, or what to believe",2020-02-16 02:41:22,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4p2kk/feeling_like_an_idiot_or_what_to_believe/

All we know is that what has happened in Wuhan is unprecedented and anyone choosing to ignore the situation is more of an idiot than you.  Just my two cents.

fhtm0am,0.9386,-0.0772,"Well, in the case of SARS, which had a slower spread, we really didn't see many cases outside of Asia.[Stats from WHO.](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/2003_07_11/en/)Of course, SARS also burned out fairly quickly.COVID19 appears to be less deadly than SARS but more contagious, so I would expect that we do see outbreaks elsewhere, but higher concentration in Asia in the near term. Longer term or with the accelerated rate of spread, it's hard to say. We don't really know about genetic properties or whether people in East Asia are more susceptible, because there are too many other variables, but we know (as far as we've seen there or in the west) that a majority of cases are not severe. I would really like to see more data about the people who developed severe cases and those who died. Sex, age, prior conditions, etc. We know of elderly casualties and we know about some health care workers who were young and presumably healthy, but probably exhausted from overwork and under a great deal of emotional and physical stress. The people outside China who have died (France, etc.) were older, as far as we know. The people on the Diamond Princess are *mostly* older, but also healthy enough to travel, but also *also*, you don't have to be that healthy to take a cruise.So I'd really like to know if the severe cases and deaths have any common links. I know of a few people in their 30s and 40s who've died from regular flu over the past several years (including a good friend from high school who didn't smoke and was in normal, good health before getting the flu and having it progress to pneumonia.) So I don't know if knowing that most of the COVID19 severe cases are older or smokers is that helpful or if it actually matters that much as this spreads. I don't want people to think that they're immune or something if they're not in a specific category.","Feeling like an idiot, or what to believe",2020-02-16 02:41:22,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4p2kk/feeling_like_an_idiot_or_what_to_believe/

If your child is old enough (10-11ish), make this an opportunity to teach your child, instead of hiding the information.

A surprising amount of packaging is produced in Europe and North America, it is expensive to ship empty containers around the world. The raw material used in the packaging is also made in the US in large capacity - most of our supply chains in that regard are fine. Shortages will be impossible to upscale for in the short term.

China is really amazing at fermentation products, so much if America's antibiotic supply comes from there. Due to the nature of the business, it is typical to keep 3 months to several years worth supply of ingredients on hand at a manufacturing facility. Luckily, while many raw ingredients come from China, the finished product many times come from the US or EU. With this in mind, our company has some backordered product waiting for China to get back to work, but very few drugs are impacted, since the material is on hand elsewhere. We estimate that only if China doesn't come back to work by May, the pharma industry could start to see shortages. Three thing that really sucks here is lost capital. It seems China tends to run their businesses cash lean, so being out of production like this really hurts their bottom line. We'll have to see when this passes who will prosper and who might tank. The government tries hard to hold up businesses after large events (like SARS), but you'll never know until people start coming back.

fhw9dd0,0.1152,-0.7096,"Let me start by saying I'm not here to tell you not to worry. But I want to give you a bit of background about how so many people ended up under some form of quarantine, which will hopefully provide some perspective.The way you wrote your post, it sounds like you think that these massive quarantine measures must be a rational, coordinated response to the problem, perhaps due to information we don't have access to, or some other factor. The gist is, ""how can you think it's not a huge thing when they're putting hundreds of millions under quarantine?""I'm watching the measures roll out on the ground, and this is clearly not the case. We like to think of China as a centralized authoritarian monolith, where every action is controlled from the very top. [The fact of the matter is that while it certainly is an authoritarian country, decisions are often decentralized, and even uncoordinated, in surprising ways](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2166576/how-chinas-balancing-act-between-centralised).The central government has a habit of handing down goals to local governments without providing any specific instructions about how to go about achieving these goals, or funding for that matter. You then have officials at various levels across the country interpreting them in their own ways and taking matters into their own hands. That way, if things go well, the central government can take the credit for meeting said target, and if things go poorly, they can publicly censure the local official and wash their hands of any blame.This is exactly what is happening right now, and it's happening on an unprecedented scale, all the way down to the village level.I think a lot of observers from the west are imagining some giant nerve center in Beijing where all these decisions are being made. While I'm sure there is such a nerve center, they are clearly not going through every city's quarantine and lock-down policies with a fine-toothed comb, and probably are not even talking about the rural counties, towns and villages in anything more than a very abstract, generalized way.Here are the factors officials on the local level are responding to:\- A scary and poorly understood epidemic\- The epidemic hitting in the middle of the [world's largest annual mass migration](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2183049/3-billion-trips-40-days-china-begins-lunar-new-year-mass) (several hundred million people travel from the industrial centers and major cities, mainly to smaller towns and villages to visit family, and they were supposed to go back to work over a week ago)\- Directives from the central government to go on ""wartime footing"" to ""defeat the epidemic""\- [Contradictory directives from the central government to facilitate workers returning to the cities and getting back to work](https://www.facebook.com/ChinaLawBlog/photos/a.10152520838701109/10156634631961109/?type=1&theater) (while simultaneously ensuring that a new round of infections isn't sparked by this)What we end up with is a crazy patchwork of measures. While the cities hit the hardest have been placed on almost total lockdown, you have a dizzying array of measures everywhere else. We'll often see, in a single city, some apartment complexes locking all entrances and issuing passbooks to residents, allowing each household only one trip every one or two days for supplies; meanwhile, neighboring apartment complexes aren't restricting the movements of their residents at all, and instead just taking everyone's temperature at the gate, and maybe barring entry to non-residents.In Beijing, [some bars and restaurants are open and allowed to serve customers](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2020/02/chinas-damaged-economy-under-the-coronavirus-really-damaged.html), as long as they take temperatures and register them. As the capital, you would expect the city to be setting an example for an orderly return to work. But they have recently announced that anyone returning to the city [now has to undergo self-quarantine and monitoring for 14 days](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51509248).Meanwhile, in Kunming, where I live, all the bars are closed, and restaurants are only allowed to provide delivery and takeout. [QR codes have been posted at the entrance to every residential building, open business and public place](https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3050446/yunnan-province-plan-contain-coronavirus-tracking-residents-public), and you need to scan these codes when you enter and exit. BUT, there is no self-quarantine rule in effect unless you have recently visited a hard-hit epidemic region.Many of the several hundred million currently on lockdown are stuck in villages. It's hard to get an accurate count, but there are probably [well over two million villages in China](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/05/372491552/chinas-villages-are-dying-a-new-film-asks-if-they-can-be-saved). Many of them have set up makeshift barricades at the entrance to the village, barring anyone from entering or leaving. Some have banded together to create roadblocks along provincial and county roads to ensure that no one can bring the virus into their area. People have been stuck in these places for weeks now, many of them city dwellers who just came to visit grandma for a few days for the New Year. They can't get back because the roadblocks are not coordinated by one single authority, and drivers are worried about getting stuck between roadblocks, and being unable to either reach their destination or turn back and go home.Anyway, the point of all this is that while the epidemic is certainly very serious, the number of people placed on one form of lockdown or another isn't necessarily a good gauge of exactly how serious it is. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see economists and policy wonks arguing next year about which ends up with the higher body count: the disease or the government's response.**TL;DR:** The number of people on lockdown isn't a very good reference in deciding how much you should worry.","One out of ten people on earth right now is under restricted varrying levels of quarantine.

A few days ago he posted a panicked video where he implied that intelligence services were targeting him and directing viewers to some sort of a scam site. Check my post history. I'm skeptical af about the official narrative. But the simple fact is that around 20-25% of victims require hospitalisation. There is absolutely no way to hide that number of hospitalisations in any Western country. There's a huge difference between ""being concerned about the situation"" and ""panicking"". We SHOULD be concerned. We should not panic. Prep smartly by stocking up with some extra food/supplies.

My last day was going to be a day trip to sharm el sheikh, planning on the lax Egyptian security so I had short connections planned.Well, a few days before this day trip, terrorists blew up a plane. Now, I wasn't worried about another terrorist attack at the same airport. The issue was, now there was a ton of security, my tightly timed day trip likely wouldn't be possible.So I canceled it anyway, and when home, read the fine print. Terrorism wouldn't be covered, but transportation issues causing you to miss your flights would. So I was able to print out article after article of long security lines, of countries evacuating their passengers but since baggage security was suspected in the attack no bags could be taken, so they were dumped on the side of roads causing traffic issues. So I submitted my claim not on the terrorism or security issues, but the fact that had I gone, I likely would have missed one of my flights. That plus a Luftansa strike hours after I left Cairo would have meant any delay/missed flight would have caused me to be stuck in Cairo or Germany and my travel insurance would have been on the hook for that.So submitted everything, got my money in 2 weeks no additional questions asked.

fhyvgml,-0.4047,-0.128,"This is just a theory but i had a thought about the date of origin and the spread of the virus. On Dec 31st the first alarm was raised, and I read that the doctor had seen ""dozens"" of pneumonia like patients. This would indicate that there was already a rather large spread because it looks like the majority of people are not badly affected by it. For dozens to be hospitalised by it indicates quite a large number of people contracting even by that point. Further to this, we know that the official number of cases in China is unlikely to be accurate, as the WHO bump in cases shows that they were not diagnosing every case.   People seem to be going on the coronavirus originating in January. It might have been going on for quite a bit longer?  For example, I live in Japan and apparently we have had a very nasty flu season. It's possible that coronavirus cases were partly responsible for this? The doctor's might have been misdiagnosing, as they had no idea that it might be something else? Or am I way off?","Daily Discussion Post - Feb. 17, 2020 | Questions, images, videos, comments, unconfirmed reports, theories, suggestions (Weibo / social media/ unverified YouTube videos)",2020-02-16 14:47:42,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4ypvs/daily_discussion_post_feb_17_2020_questions/

The current rate of mild cases alone [is 80%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/most-coronavirus-cases-are-mild-complicating-efforts-to-respond/2020/02/12/213603a4-4dc2-11ea-bf44-f5043eb3918a_story.html), so unless literally every single person who doesn't have a mild case drops dead without medical attention, 20% is an overestimate.

I genuinely don’t see how we stop this becoming a pandemic. There’s nothing to suggest the R0 is going down. There’s no evidence to suggest mortality will be less than 2%. If this goes where people are predicting, with 50% of the UK getting infected, there aren’t even words. At a best case 1% fatality rate that’s 330,000+ dead. At a base 2% that’s 660,000 dead. With the NHS collapsing and the death rate jumping to 10% that’s 3.3 million dead. That doesn’t account for all the deaths caused by people unable to receive treatment for other conditions or road accidents etc. If infection goes beyond 50% population and/or 10% mortality the end result becomes even more horrific.

The -8% collapse of the shanghai index back on the first trading day after the holidays likely kicked the CBOC and Fed into action to pump up the markets. But the disconnect between equities / bonds / commodities and shipping is clear. Big picture, China is an integral part of the global economy and over the last decade the entire world has become increasingly exposed to China, while China has become more exposed to its own domestic economy - relying 75% on their Chinese domestic consumption to power their growth engine (See McKinsey 2019 China report).

If you are referring to bonds and retirement accounts no don't sell those and take the penalties. You can follow the advice of some of the other comments here.I wouldn't sell right now just because of the virus. Fear trading isn't the best move. Some people sell out of fear and take unnecessary losses.It also depends on what you invest in, If it is a big legit company like Disney, Google, or other companies that take a fairly high price per share, they might be down now, but they will probably go back up in time. Same with funds. If they are large well known funds they will probably recover. This advice applies to positions that you are holding that are already in the red. If you have positive positions head to the stop limit method and get out in the green and buy back in when the prices do eventually fall but are on an upswing.I have thought about the market going down. Some of my positions are already down but I believe that they will go back up in time, so I leave them. There is nothing I can do now and I don't want to pass my tax write off limits for 2020 because of a fear trading. It  only makes sense to sell on loses now  if you need that money. In which case you shouldn't have all of your money in the market anyway. That is always very risky and not advisable.I put stop limits on my positive holdings every day that the market will be open. Each stop limit is good for 24 hours. I don't normally use stop limits very often but have been due to the uncertainty of the virus. With a stop limit if my stock or fund hits the limit I set it's an automatic sell.Just selling for the sake of it is silly. One of my stocks is up $22 per share since last week. If I fear sold I would have missed out. The market probably will go down, but it's up right now , so ride the wave. Set stop limits each day based on your new earnings.",Is the stock market about to crash due to this virus?

I doubt interest rates are going higher anytime soon since the threat of a pandemic caused stock market panic lurks in the shadows. Look at the 10 year US treasury rate starting around 2006 and look at it through 2008.

There is still a lot of value in China's data even though we cannot take the absolute values, **we can look at the** **rate of** ***change***.What's important is that the data methodology is consistent (ie. if sick a patient is tested positive, he/she is included vs. a sick patient is not tested, and is therefore not included -- it doesn't matter if are under-reporting, treat it as a sample and you can still conduct statistical analysis to gain insight to the real population), and I think it has been fairly consistent up until they included clinically diagnosed cases.With that said, we can examine how the data has *changed over time,* such as calculating the % change in new cases (today/yesterday - 1), and whether this % change is *decelerating or accelerating over time.*  **The sample data doesn't have to be 100% accurate in absolute terms (because it is a sample?!), but as long as the methodology has not changed, it will still be directionally accurate when we look at the rate of the change.**So without getting into the politics of it, we are seeing incremental new confirm cases happening at a decelerated rate.

fhw09vo,0.877,0.0,"Thanks for posting.From the article: “In terms of the virus data, the number of cumulative deaths reported is described by a simple mathematical formula to a very high accuracy, according to a quantitative-finance specialist who ran a regression of the data for Barron’s. A near-perfect 99.99% of variance is explained by the equation, this person said.Put in an investing context, that variance, or so-called r-squared value, would mean that an investor could predict tomorrow’s stock price with almost perfect accuracy. In this case, the high r-squared means there is essentially zero unexpected variability in reported cases day after day.Barron’s re-created the regression analysis of total deaths caused by the virus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year, and found similarly high variance. We ran it by Melody Goodman, associate professor of biostatistics at New York University’s School of Global Public Health.“I have never in my years seen an r-squared of 0.99,” Goodman says. “As a statistician, it makes me question the data.”Real human data are never perfectly predictive when it comes to something like an epidemic, Goodman says, since there are countless ways that a person could come into contact with the virus.For context, Goodman says a “really good” r-squared, in terms of public health data, would be a 0.7. “Anything like 0.99,” she said, “would make me think that someone is simulating data. It would mean you already know what is going to happen.”There’s one scenario where the data could be understandably jiggered, Goodman said. Because there are privacy concerns around public health data, it’s conceivable that someone would simulate the data based on real data, so as to make the individuals unidentifiable. But even then, the r-squared in this case is extraordinarily high. Moreover, says Goodman, when data are manipulated to protect privacy, it would need to be disclosed; there is no such disclosure on the WHO site.What does this mean for investors and analysts? If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.”https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/chinas-economic-data-have-always-raised-questions-its-coronavirus-numbers-do-too-51581622840",Barron’s reported that the mortality data out of China has unexpected variance of zero,2020-02-16 17:40:03,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f50zhn/barrons_reported_that_the_mortality_data_out_of/

If a few of these asymptomatic cases are like the U.K. super spreader, medical teams will be having a hard time trying to get a hold on everyone they dealt with.  Will Scomo close the borders to Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Indonesia/Bali? I dont know. So I don't think we are out of the woods yet.  There is so much we don't know about this virus.

It didn't spread as fast, so with respect to  COVID19, I would be surprised and delighted if it was erradicated  in May and everyone in China went back to work ,no worries. I don't think so. I think they will be trying to get back to work at the same time as keeping cities locked down.

It's looking like a 3% rate of it being serious (so far, we are dealing with a lag). How does it compare to the flu? Well in my country for a recent year, the death rate from influenza AND/OR pneumonia was 0.017% of the total population. Or roughly 1 in every 1000 people they think got the flu that year. It's looking like, with good hospital care that isn't under strain, that the death rate from Covid19 is 10x that rate, and around 10x the rate of cases needing hospitalisation. It also has the potential to infect 3-6x the amount of the population as the flu does. The healthcare systems would come under massive strain.We have also started to see the odd case that they haven't been able to trace back to a known patient. The amount that they HAVE been able to trace has been pretty phenomenal, and points to it not being 'out of control' just yet.

fhwhzot,0.9548,0.0772,"Several companies that supplies my place of work who ship from Hong Kong and mainland China and some personal business associates shipping the same region have advised us to expect delays and we have experienced late and still unaccounted for deliveries of laboratory equipment, bulk and specialty chemical precursors. Oddly we received samples (very expensive, microgram quantities) of nCoV and other coronavirus antigens for laboratory use rather quickly as soon as they became available; this is probably due to the unprecedented scientific response to the new virus, we need these substances urgently to experiment with to confirm/refute properties of the new virus calculated using molecular dynamics simulations and to discover new properties that could be exploited in the search for new therapeutics. Very rarely does in silico modelling perfectly predict the affinity of one substance has to bind to another based on calculation of interaction energies - performing binding assays in the lab allows us to measure empirically the strength of ligand-protein interactions for example, using reversible chemical reactions, one or more methods of accurately measuring very low concentrations of substances and a bit of calculation. In a research paper from a few years ago computer simulation was used to model docking between a wide range of strong opioid analgesic drugs (in the state they exist in the brain at physiological pH) and the Mu opioid receptor - the model predicted strong binding for only around 60% of them. It also predicted that Morphine wouldn’t bind very well at all and was expected to be a poor Mu ligand when of course we know and measure that this is not true, Morphine is objectively a strong analgesic and we measure it binding to the receptor with low nanomolar affinity. Anyway; nCoV spike binds to ACE2 but it’s binding domain is not the same as the ACE2 catalytic domain; nCoV doesn’t bind to what one would call ACE2’s active site where it acts as a zinc carboxypeptidase to remove a single amino acid from the end of Angiotensin peptide molecules. Some researchers are looking to discover ACE2-antibody conjugate drugs that would bind to nCoV blocking it from binding to cellular ACE2. We are looking for molecules that bind to ACE2 at the nCoV receptor binding domain that also preferably don’t interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2. Positive results from both of these research pathways would result in putative nCoV entry inhibitor drugs (a new class of drugs or several new classes) that can then be tested in animals and eventually humans. Vaccines are also another large research area however I am more interested in the classes of compounds I described earlier as vaccines most often are most useful before exposure to the virus enabling a more specific and rapid immune response - some have disease modifying effects in the already infected but they almost always must be given within hours of exposure to be most effective (rabies vaccine, smallpox vaccine) - so a vaccine probably isn’t going to be much use to the already infected especially since the rather long incubation period results in many people not realising that they were exposed until they have been infected for however many days it takes for them to have symptoms, some sources state this to be 1-14days and could be longer. Antiviral drugs, like the already existing classes of protease inhibitors RdRP inhibitors and hopefully nCoV entry inhibitors, if effective can be curative or disease modifying (preventing COVID-19 disease progression to severe pneumonia, ARDS and death) in even the most critically ill patients. The work continues and does so at a rapid pace, the number of molecules that we’re able to screen for ACE2 binding and then antiviral activity in such a short amount of time is incredible and wouldn’t have been possible 20+ years ago mainly due to great advancements in computing power available to researchers. Even if vaccines fail, I still don’t think all would be lost as I’m very confident that a range of effective antivirals with multiple targets and of multiple drug classes will eventually (likely quicker than usual) enter clinical practice just as the outbreak has allowed the use and study of unapproved or approved for other purpose substances, especially Remdesivir, to be used in patients that have no other option (compassionate use) and the already sick that consent to receiving an unapproved drug that has not completed the required clinical trials (investigational use in the sick patient with no other option that is still lucid enough to consent to be part of the experiment). So the new vaccine and therapeutic pathways to treatment at going as fast as they can; we really are. However; if nCoV gets significantly out of China (10000+ international cases) we may start to see variation in infectivity between people from different ethnic backgrounds - the expression of ACE2 varies amongst humans with East Asian populations expressing it most highly (in peer reviewed and preprint studies). And in addition to that; one of the greatest patient populations amongst white British people (where I’m based) is people with cardiovascular disease especially primary and smoking/diabetes/obesity induced hypertension. These people are well treated by modern medicine with a wide variety of CV drugs. Two that are of significance here are the ACE inhibitors (not ACE2) and the AT1 antagonists - two types of common antihypertensives prescribed in the west that work via inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensins-ACE-AT1 axis. A worrying feature of this confirmed in peer reviewed literature is that use of both classes of these drugs induces ACE2 expression. [Article](https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/73/3/463/367423) So those using these classes of drugs for CV disease may be more at risk along with the risk varying depending on ones racial background; CV drugs are well known for some classes being more effective for people of one racial background and another being more effective for people of a different racial background both suffering from similar CV conditions. The evidence isn’t all there yet with regards to nCoV infection but if the virus does go pandemic then to survive we are all eventually going to have to take risks; the research suggest that when taking those risks one should consider people close to you/that you live with taking ACE inhibitors or AT1 antagonists (and probably other classes of drugs) not only because they already have a pre-existing condition but because their treatment for it has been shown to induce ACE2 expression which may make them particular susceptible to nCoV. (All the above is just a bit more info on how treatments for nCoV can be discover and how susceptibility to infection most probably varies amongst humans. By no means is it a recommendation to stop taking any drugs that your doctor prescribes for you - as always only ever take or stop taking medication as your doctor prescribes. The science is constantly developing and more definite answers to all of these questions will come with time. And to further dissuade anyone using those two classes of CV drugs from stopping taking them to try’s and prevent nCoV infection in pandemic conditions; usage of ACE inhibitors and AT1 antagonists upregulates ACE2 expression over a longer period of time than the incubation period and even the course of COVID-19 disease; stopping using those drugs would not only be dangerous for your CV health and against your doctor’s prescription advice but also stopping taking them wouldn’t immediately eliminate all the upregualted ACE2 expression (ACE2 would only then be downregualted back to the unmedicated level over weeks to months as the expression of the ACE2 gene changes and the cells remove an recycle ACE2 from the cellular membranes - this is not an instantaneous effect, if you do use these CV drugs stopping using them will not help you nor is there evidence yet to prove that stopping them will help you even if you have 6 months notice before nCoV exposure)Here’s hoping for restoration of normal length consignment deliveries from China as well as the improved health of the populations affected very soon. And if this doesn’t occur naturally; millions of us working in pharmaceuticals will not stop until we have more treatment options that drastically reduce the mortality rate (even if the only motivator for some is profit). I don’t particularly agree with profiteering from humanitarian crises; I’ve written in here in the past regarding HIV patients that essentially now have to pay and subscribe to life. Without a definite cure for nCoV (or HIV for that matter) if my place of work produces a successful disease modifying drug or preventative non vaccine treatment for nCoV, I will argue that we give it away for a penny more than the cost it takes to produce it given the current epidemic. I will almost definitely lose that arguement and if nCoV infection and a drug to treat it become commonplace; a few people will become very rich; I won’t be one of them, but I certainly hope that my team at least gets to put their names to some of the research leading to the widespread use of a treatment that makes nCoV infection treatable with a mortality rate approaching zero.Edit: Typos",Shenzhen factory just told me ON HOLD till virus clears,2020-02-16 18:26:18,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f51lh9/shenzhen_factory_just_told_me_on_hold_till_virus/

Once the virus goes communal in your area you will have to remove him from daycare. Clearly you will still have to go to work but   Hopefully you have grandparents who are retired or spouse who can be at home. That care taker must limit their exposure to the outside world. No visitors no going grocery shopping. They will effectively be quarantined with the baby. Hopefully you have a yard they can play at but otherwise the baby and the caretaker are severely limited from making contact with others. So by limiting that exposure you won’t need mask as you don’t have to wear mask at home, however, the potential source Of exposure is you. When you go outside you wear a mask...DO NOT TOUCH THE FRONT OF THE MASK WHEN TAKING IT OFF. DO NOT REUSE 1 TIME USE MASK. Practice good hygiene. When coming home from work enter your mud room. Properly discard your mask take off your work clothes put them in the wash. Shower before you interact. If you feel like you have been exposed then wear a mask in the house and limit your interaction with others (6ft away don’t hold baby) for 4 days. Takes about 3-5 days to show symptoms...tail end is 14 days though I’m hearing rumors it might be 24days. Have abuteral on hand. Talk to your pediatrician about having a nebulizer and abuteral. Abuteral is a rescue inhaler and will help him breath to clear his lungs if he develop RSV or something similar. Abuteral will be hard to come by once this hits the fan. Try to get a small supply now.Make an appointment with your pediatrician now for a wellness visit and talk to them about this. Talk to them about a nebulizer, abuteral have him teach you what to look for in a cough and when to administer it. And when to come in. Have baby Tylenol on hand.

I still will try and get sick (if a virus is going through our household) before he does. Because the milk will have the antibodies to shorten the severity and length of his illness. But it’s not a magic bullet. It’s why the kid gets most of their vaccines after 6 months. Even the stuff given before. The mom’s antibodies can attack them and prevent full immunity.

fjy4wbe,-0.931,0.0,"Ironically this may be the United State’s Chernobyl.It’s a confluence of all of our countries problems. Lack of access to affordable healthcare, rural hospital closings, poor protections for workers, increasing dependence on the gig economy, particularly ridesharing, and (arguably) a President who doesn’t believe in science and puts his in tears above all other.People either can’t afford to take time off work, or are forbidden from taking time off. They can’t afford doctor visits, and they will be bankrupt if they get seriously ill. In many parts of the country rural hospitals are on a shoestring budget. One in four is at risk of closing. Many people depend on delivery and ride-sharing jobs to make ends meet. Which helps spread the virus, but also makes them vulnerable to a crisis that makes people avoid each other.Not going to rant about the president, because either you understand why he’s dangerous by now or you don’t. But I will say that this underscores how important a free press is. If our only source of info was the government, they could make this whole thing disappear and say it was just the flu.

The kind where we've had several local-ish landfalls in the last decade. *And yet,* when the most recent hurricane warning went through, I was the sole person in my family/acquaintance group thinking 'evacuate'. There was a definite pattern. Locals who lived in trailers, manufactured homes - they left. Locals who lived in stick-builts, brick homes - they stayed.We did evacuate. We were one of the few to head west. Most of those who evacuated headed north - to the nearest big city. North was the same direction as the incoming storm, and yet most people headed that way. We went straight west. Drove for an hour and a half, holed up, the storm went overhead as nothing worse than a summer thunderstorm.People made fun. ""Ahhh, look at the northerner, they see a lil' 'cane and they running."" I didn't grow up in a hurricane zone. I grew up a couple hours south of the Canadian border, I'm not used to hurricanes. The locals were. They'd been hit, as aforementioned, a few times in the past decade. This was old hat to them. They'd been there. They'd done that. They thought I was silly to evacuate because they'd been hit by hurricanes before and *never needed to evacuate*. The locals were experienced. Unfortunately, they were experienced in exactly the sort of plan that works right up until it doesn't. The 'cane swipes had been smaller, they'd been indirect. This time, the hurricane's eye went straight over my town. As a Cat4. My spouse's parents had planned to ride it out at home - within *sight* of the bay!- and only went to the brick home of an uncle because I got ""silly"" and was insistent. The uncle's home started disintegrating, and they had to decamp for safer grounds as the hurricane's eye went overhead.

fhxrgf0,-0.9735,-0.4404,"There's a lot to unpack here.  I will try and start with some background.When this and other subreddits were created, one of the first issues that arose was the propagation of fake news, conspiracy theories, and so on and so forth.  The difficulty in ascertaining what's real and what's not has never become so blurred in our lifetime.  Information comes so quickly, it would almost be considered irresponsible to allow conspiracy theories and memes to coexist with relevant and important information.  Due to this, after discussing this with other moderators, it appears that bans were handed out to immediately stop the proliferation of damaging information / memes that could be construed as serious, inappropriately racially divisive, or harmful to serious discussions.  And part of the reactive response on our part was to create filters for our automod (i.e., bioweapons).  I specifically asked the older mods about the bans for discussing bioweapons, and the consensus has been that no one has been banned *at all* for discussing bioweapons.  However, there is an active filter due to the issues the cropped up as indicated above.This is why we created /r/COVID19 to try and encourage scientific discussions, while using /r/coronavirus as a general discussion platform.  -------------------------------------------------------------That being said: As a mod team, we are definitely not immune from criticism.  A few mistakes were made and that it wasn't discussed freely with the community in mind was a mistake.  What is a reputable news source?  What are banned phrases?  What would lead to a ban?  There are things we are actively seeking to improve, with regards to both what sources can be used, and how we filter certain keywords or phrases.  To be honest, our fear is allowing this subreddit and others like it falling trap to the propagation of fake news and becoming quarantined like certain subreddits I won't name here. Reddit's policy has been to not allow threats or discussions of death or violence that are discussed irresponsibly and harmfully.  To that end, some of the bans we've implemented were due to that.  Other bans were due to sensationalized headlines (editorialized), or proliferation of news that could not be verified (Youtube videos), spamming, and so on and so forth.  This is why certain subreddits were quarantined.-------------------------------------------------------------It's a tough position trying to ensure content is being posted and discussed responsibly while trying to be hands off as well.  As a new subreddit, it's a maturing process we are trying to speed up a bit with the number of new moderators we've brought on board. Discussion about this subject needs to continue and should be able to continue without interference.  Our issue is that the discussion of this will inevitably lead to outlandish conspiracy theories as some of you have noted in this thread and other threads.  How do we manage that kind of content without impacting our user experience and maintaining a platform that encourages that discussion?As always, feedback is appreciated.","Can someone please explain to me why people are being banned here for discussing the fact that COVID19 is a possible biological weapon when The New York Times, Harvard, Senator Tom Cotton, Fox News, BBC have all reported this as a possibility ?",2020-02-16 20:26:14,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f5344a/can_someone_please_explain_to_me_why_people_are/
