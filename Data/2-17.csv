These flights departed Japan at approximately 4:30 PM Eastern time on February 16 and will arrive in the United States later this morning.  All passengers are being closely monitored by medical professionals throughout the flight, and any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated.Upon landing in the United States, passengers will deplane at either Travis AFB or Joint Base San Antonio and will remain under quarantine for 14 days. Passengers that develop symptoms in flight and those with positive test results will remain isolated on the flights and will be transported to an appropriate location for continued isolation and care.""","14 passengers test positive while leaving the ""Diamond Princess""",2020-02-17 00:09:32,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f55kkt/14_passengers_test_positive_while_leaving_the/

fhx3cga,-0.9775,-0.128,"Major cracks are appearing in Australia’s frontline fight against the coronavirus with general practitioners furious they are not being paid for triaging patients who ring to discuss symptoms.And the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners said GPs have been given conflicting advice from nine state and federal governments about the right type of masks and testing procedures for patients with coronavirus.It is high time for a single centralised, national body dispensing information, rather than advice from the state and territory health agencies, RACGP chief Dr Harry Nespolon said.Initially doctors were told to wear higher grade P2 face masks when treating potential coronavirus patients but now are being advised they only need a cheaper surgical mask, P2 masks are needed only if the patient is symptomatic.However, one state, South Australia still tells GPs to use a P2 face mask at all times.More than 1700 medical staff in China have already been infected with coronavirus and it has proved highly contagious on a cruise ship moored off Japan.GPs have been given conflicting advice about the right type of masks and testing procedures for patients with coronavirus. Picture: Chinatopix via AP“We are also getting different advice from the states and territories on the tests for coronavirus and who should be taking them – should they be done by a GP in a clinic or should they be done in a hospital in a negative pressure room?” RACGP president Dr Harry Nespolon said.Queensland is telling GPs to “immediately place the patient in a single room (ensuring air does not circulate to other areas) with the door closed” and if the patient has severe symptoms recommends isolating patient in room with negative air pressure.Other states don’t require this level of infection control.Queensland also wants specimens to be hand delivered and not be sent in pneumatic tubes.While NSW says its OK for patients to have the testing carried out by private pathology companies South Australia says “do not refer patients to pathology collection centres – specimens should be collected by the treating doctor or a designated specimen collection staff member/centre”.Some states ask GPs to test not only patients who’ve been to China recently but also those who’ve been to Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore or Indonesia while others don’t.“It has taken too long for state health agencies to update their advice in line with the federal advice. GPs have faced weeks of confusion trying to figure out which guidelines they should follow. It’s undermining the critical work GPs do in caring for patients and in controlling outbreaks like coronavirus,” Dr Nespolon said.Some states ask GPs to test not only patients who’ve been to China recently but also those who’ve been to Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore or Indonesia while others don’t. Picture: APDoctors are also angry that governments are expecting them to effectively treat coronavirus patients for free.“For example, some of the states have told people to call their GPs if they suspect they have coronavirus. The problem with that is GPs who are booked out are going to have to stop seeing practice patients and act as a free telephone triage service.“We are not remunerated for that and it can take up a lot of time. It’s just another instance of why we need a consistent nationwide approach,” Dr Nespolon said.The RACGP is today urging the government to develop a national plan to deal with potential pandemics after the coronavirus outbreak revealed failures in the public health response.It echoes calls from the Australian Medical Association and the Australasian Society for Infectious Disease (ASID) which two weeks ago called for a national centre for disease control in Australia.“The public gets confused and stressed out and they don’t know who to listen to,” said the president of ASID Professor Josh Davies.The US, China and Europe all have centralised bodies that co-ordinate responses to infectious outbreaks and the World Health Organisation prefers to deal with a single representative body in each nation in a crisis.Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australia’s readiness to meet the challenges of the novel coronavirus has been proven by the fact there had been no evidence of transmission within this country.“The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), which includes the Australian Government Chief Medical Officer and all Chief Health Officers, has provided consistent advice for GPs and health practitioners, which is available on the Health website,” he said“It is a matter for individual jurisdictions if they wish to take additional measures,” he said.Australian Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy conceded there could be different advice at a state level on coronavirus.The states base their planning based on their own organisational requirements and structures within their healthcare systems, he said.“The healthcare systems, e.g., governance and management of hospital networks are not uniform across all states and territories,” he said.",Australin doctors call for national pandemic plan as coronavirus outbreak exposes response flaws,2020-02-17 04:35:54,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f584sn/australin_doctors_call_for_national_pandemic_plan/

It has reached 24 other countries so far and is spreading like the influenza virus does each winter. Trying to stop influenza transmission is like trying to stop the wind. Nothing in our experience gives us hope we can halt an emerging worldwide epidemic spreading person-to-person like this coronavirus. It appears that on average, a case transmits to two people. After 10 doubling generations, which takes just 60 days total, that original infected individual has started a chain of more than 3,500 cases. Effective vaccines are many months, if not years, away.>Border closures, quarantines and airport screenings have, at best, slowed the disease, but they hardly stopped it. So what can governments and individuals do as the situation inexorably progresses?>If we are to have any real impact on this emerging crisis, we must safeguard the health-care workers who put their lives on the line treating patients. On Jan. 20, the Chinese National Health Commission revealed a covid-19 outbreak among 13 nurses and one physician, all related to the care of a single infected patient. An investigation published in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that 40 of the first 138 patients diagnosed at Wuhan University Hospital were health-care workers, their infections related to caring for infected patients. Additionally, 17 patients treated for other conditions contracted the infection simply by breathing contaminated hospital air. Numerous Chinese physicians have spoken publicly over the past week on the major shortage of equipment necessary to protect workers and patients.",Health-care workers are the front-line warriors against coronavirus.

SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus, as are many other viruses. Calling SARS-CoV-2 ""Coronavirus"" as though this was its name can lead to confusion. Referring to it as ""the coronavirus"" is fine - given the context, it's clear which coronavirus you're talking about.This issue has been discussed by the mod team and [starting at 8pm UTC today](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4iu10/announcement_rcoronavirus_and_rchina_flu/) post titles will only be moderated to this degree on /r/COVID19.

fhxl6a9,-0.8807,0.0,"Full textBeijing is tightening access to the uncensored global internet, while carefully controlling its domestic news reports, to increase its grip on the media narrative around the coronavirus epidemic.China’s most popular VPN services, which allow foreign businesses and locals to circumvent internet censorship, have faced an onslaught of government attacks in recent weeks. As a result, some users are finding it more difficult to access censored websites, such as Google, Twitter and most foreign newspapers.VPNs, or virtual private networks, allow users in China to access the internet as if they were doing so in an uncensored third country, by sending data to and from a foreign server. Beijing’s system of internet controls, called the Great Firewall, often restricts the use of VPNs during politically sensitive periods such as the June 4 Tiananmen Square massacre anniversary, typically by blocking their third-country servers.However, many providers have faced an uptick of restrictions in recent weeks.“We are aware of a new escalation in blocks in China, and our team is working around the clock to address the impact on connectivity,” wrote ExpressVPN, one of the biggest services, on their public website on Monday.The rapid spread of the coronavirus epidemic has led to calls for freedom of speech in China, after officials’ early attempts to cover up the crisis incensed many citizens. On domestic social media, users hailed the whistleblower Li Wenliang, a doctor who was punished by police for warning others about the new virus, and later died from the disease, as a martyr.In response, Beijing is increasing efforts to ensure pro-Communist party domestic media coverage. On Sunday, the broadcast media regulator wrote that its “biggest political task” of the moment was to guide the coverage of the epidemic and fulfil the party’s news ideals.Meanwhile earlier this month, the party’s propaganda department sent in 300 journalists to Hubei province, where the coronavirus originated. Foreign journalists have been turned back from getting near Hubei’s provincial borders by local authorities who say they are enforcing quarantine requirements.Despite the government’s efforts, Chinese citizens have grown increasingly distrustful of state cover-ups, and some are looking to alternative sources for news about the outbreak. Daily traffic to GreatFire’s FreeBrowser.org, a website that allows Chinese users to browse uncensored foreign news articles, has roughly doubled since January 25, two days after the epidemic centre of Wuhan began its lockdown.“Despite the wide availability of domestic news about the coronavirus, Chinese people are still looking to overseas, uncensored platforms, for more information. This is a very strong sign that most Chinese people do not trust the authorities to tell them the truth about the virus,” said Charlie Smith of GreatFire, an internet censorship monitoring organisation.But the crackdown on commercially available VPNs means it is getting more difficult for Chinese readers to find uncensored information.According to GreatFire’s Circumvention Central, a website that allows users to test the stability of their VPNs, the stability of Astrill, another big VPN service used in China, dipped in January to a four-year low. The number of people testing their VPNs using Circumvention Central has also increased in the past month, usually a sign that VPN users are experiencing problems. Astrill did not respond immediately to a request for comment. While ordinary citizens are finding it harder to get on to censored platforms such as Twitter, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying drew mockery online after launching her Twitter account on Friday, with some commenters asking her what VPN she was using. “No winter lasts forever, every spring is sure to follow,” Ms Hua wrote in her first tweet. Ms Hua’s account is the first launched by an individual Chinese spokesperson, although the foreign ministry opened its official account in November.",China stifles foreign internet to control coronavirus coverage,2020-02-17 08:16:38,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f5b19z/china_stifles_foreign_internet_to_control/

fhxq5k7,0.8652,0.0,">Sorry but our lives are more important than moneyThe point at which to control this was a few months ago in China. Something this contagious, with this amount of numbers, and this long of an incubation period can't be shut down, even if we want to panic now and lock down freedom of movement entirely. The CDC has been talking about a control strategy to blunt the worst of cases. That's where the focus is, not stopping this.Some of the more recent estimates ([https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v1) \- disclaimer: still yet to be peer reviewed) are saying that 40% of cases are being detected entering the country, if the US is to be considered a high-detection country. My understanding is the tests for this virus have a huge false negative rate, and some people have to be tested several times before they get a positive result back.If they test the major cities, and find a few cases, there's sure to be more out there. In a few weeks, it'll be spreading rapidly already. I guess the question is, is it better to be aware of the spread more gradually, or get the news all at once when the exponential spread begins to hit us. I'd personally go with the former, and prefer they test more people.It's just a bad situation. Money vs. safety isn't a clear breakdown at this point. It's here, probably at a low level. How do we best handle that news, as a society, without panicking? How do we look out for the most vulnerable?

This is in addition to preventing entry to China.  At the same time, ""Cathay Pacific"", which operates daily flights from Ben Gurion Airport to Hong Kong - is expected to temporarily cancel its flights Amir Alon and Itay Blumenthal |  Posted 21:19, 17/02/2020 Corona panic: Interior Minister Aryeh Deri ordered Monday (Monday) following the recommendation of the Ministry of Health and the head, Minister Jacob Litzman, to prevent entry of anyone who has stayed in Thailand, Macau, Singapore and Hong Kong for the past two weeks - and does not have Israeli citizenship.  The announcement comes in addition to preventing entry to China.  Similar to China's directive - it does not apply to staying at airports within the continuation flights.The order, signed by the Director of the Population and Immigration Authority, will come into effect on Thursday. By doing so, these states will join the existing order last month, which prohibits entry of tourists from China.As a result of the new directives, Cathay Pacific Airlines, which operates daily flights from Ben Gurion Airport to Hong Kong, is expected to announce a temporary cancellation of its flights to and from Israel.The company explained that the new regulations would not allow the line to be operated in part because it would prevent air crews from entering Hong Kong into Israel.  ""If our crews aren't allowed in, we won't have a choice,"" said an airline official. Earlier, Ynet reported that Israeli shipping company Mano began canceling cruises planned for the beginning of the cruise season - including those planned for particularly popular tourist holidays, during Passover and the holidays.  Ynet has learned that the cancellations are due to the panic of the Corona virus worldwide.  It was also learned that ""Mano Shipping"" canceled their voyages - even those that should not exist in risk areas for the infection - such as Cyprus and Greece.Today, ticket buyers who were planning to spend the holiday indulging in a Mediterranean cruise got phone calls from the company telling them that the scheduled voyage was canceled.  When asked by some of the customers whether the cause of the cancellation lies in the spread of the corona - they were told that there was ""no sufficient demand"" for sailing and so they were forced to cancel.  It should be noted that it is about two months before the cruises are scheduled to depart.  ""Mano Shipping"" said that ""since the cruise season has not yet begun and in the light of public sensitivity, it has been decided to postpone the opening of the season for several weeks.**Insulation even without the corona symptoms: the guidelines for returning from the East were extended**Also, yesterday, the Ministry of Health announced the extension of guidelines for travelers returning from countries in the Far East following the outbreak of the Corona virus.  After assessing the situation in the ministry, it was decided that even those returning from Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore and Macau will remain in solitary confinement for 14 days from the date of their return to Israel.  In addition, El Al has announced that it will reduce its flights to Thailand, but at this time, the extent of the move is unknown.According to the new guidelines, anyone who has returned from Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore and Macau from today will stay in solitary confinement until the completion of 14 days from the return date - the incubation period of the disease.  Staying in solitary confinement should not leave the public space nor stay in public places, including educational institutions, workplaces, public transport, recreation and shopping, hospitals and clinics. In the case of one or more of the following symptoms: a fever, cough or shortness of breath, contact your health care provider or emergency room and notify the clinic or emergency room in advance of a patient's arrival.  Even in another medical condition that requires treatment, the caregiver must be notified in advance of the patient's arrival.  In any case, cover your mouth and nose with a surgical mask or other available cloth, and avoid traveling by public transport.Source: [Ynet](https://m.ynet.co.il/Articles/5679649) via Google Translate","Israel will now prohibit entry to all citizens of the following countries: China, Thailand, Singapore, Macau.",2020-02-17 09:30:51,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f5c7kt/israel_will_now_prohibit_entry_to_all_citizens_of/

( www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/health/cdc-coronavirus-china.amp.html ) - The CCP are actively hunting down and disappearing amateur journalists who are reporting anything that contradicts the official statements ( https://youtu.be/Iwpr55PZEJ8 ) - Investigative journalists called Wuhan crematoriums undercover as CCP officials and get told that all crematoriums are working to exhaustion at max capacity to burn 4-5× the amount of bodies as usual, per day. Massively larger than the suggested WHO figures ( https://youtu.be/5-nv7j9HEgY - starts at 14:58, but the whole video is extremely interesting) - 29 Chinese scientists from around the world wrote a research journal stating that in the earliest case, the patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no reported link to the seafood market, the authors report. “No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases,” and at least 13 of the initial victims had no apparent exposure to the market (link to the pdf - https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi1vsGKiNrnAhWFiVwKHYjQAXIQFjABegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw0SjyRQ-KtppDio2SmkUpkV&cshid=1581993504055 ) - An article from 2017 about Wuhan's biolab said that scientists were worried about a potential outbreak, ""The SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey."" ( https://www.nature.com/news/inside-the-chinese-lab-poised-to-study-world-s-most-dangerous-pathogens-1.21487 )With all this in mind, it feels like there's too many contributing factors that make this seem less and less likely to be a coincidence. I'm not saying this is bio warfare, it's more likely gross containment negligence, but it still seems extremely plausible to me.

And nearly all of these smaller supplier factories are also in China.You can bet that nearly every executive boardroom across the globe is meeting daily to discuss this exact problem and how to mitigate it.And if this really does go far enough down the road where real, large scale, durable diversification does start to occur, the results could change China's economy **dramatically**.

fhyuix0,0.975,0.0,"Covid-19, the new coronavirus that has killed nearly 1,800 people in China, causes only mild disease in four out of five people who get it, the World Health Organization has said.“It appears that Covid-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses, including Sars and Mers,” said the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding that officials were “starting to get a clearer picture of the outbreak”.The conclusion comes from analysis of data from Chinese authorities relating to 44,000 cases of Covid-19 in Hubei province, where the coronavirus was first recorded.“More than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover, 14% have severe disease including pneumonia and shortness of breath, 5% have critical disease including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure, and 2% of cases are fatal,” Tedros said in Geneva. “The risk of death increases the older you are.”He said children were not suffering from Covid-19 in the same way as adults, and more research was needed to find out why. There were still gaps in understanding that he hoped the WHO’s team of international experts would be able to work towards filling.China has reported 70,365 cases of Covid-19 infection, 2,051 of those in the past 24 hours. The new cases include those confirmed by lab tests and those diagnosed through lung CT scans read by doctors. The vast majority of Chinese cases – 94% – continue to be reported in Hubei province. China says there have been 1,772 deaths. Outside China, there have been 694 cases and four deaths.Tedros said there appeared to be a decline in the number of new cases in China. “This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change.” He said the WHO would continue to work day and night to help countries prepare for the potential arrival of the coronavirus, sending testing kits and protective equipment, working with manufacturers to ensure supplies are maintained, and training health workers.He thanked countries that had contributed towards the $675m (£520m) that the WHO has said it needs to fight the epidemic, but he added: “We have not seen the urgency in the funding that we need. We have a window of opportunity now. We need resources now to ensure countries are prepared now. We don’t know how long this window of opportunity will remain.”The WHO’s director of emergencies, Dr Michael Ryan, said the outbreak should not be described as a pandemic, even though it has spread to 25 countries outside China. “The real issue is whether we are seeing efficient community transmission outside of China and at the present time we are not observing that,” he said.Dr Sylvie Briand, the director of pandemic and epidemic diseases at the WHO, said the organisation was working closely with Japanese authorities regarding the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off the coast of Japan.“We need to make sure that we focus on our objective, our public health objective, which is to contain the virus, and not to contain the people, and making sure that we can have the right balance between the health of the population in Japan and other countries, but also the health of the people being currently on this boat,” she said.There were still many unknowns, she said. “Measures are implemented and assessed currently and monitored on a nearly hourly basis, because we learn every day and every hour more about this disease and this virus.”Meanwhile, experts said reports that some people may have incubated the virus for far longer than the 14-day quarantine period before falling ill were likely to be anomalies.The China-based Global Times tweeted that one person had been diagnosed 34 days after being in Wuhan and another 94 days after contact with someone who lived in Wuhan.Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “The last data I saw suggested 95% of people had incubation of less than 12 days. There will be the outlier, the occasional person who has a longer incubation period.” But 34 days and 94 days were extremely unlikely, he said. “Those people will have had another more recent exposure.”He added: “Incubation period is based on best possible evidence. We are learning and gaining new data all the time so [it is] entirely possible it may be revised as the outbreak carries on.”","Coronavirus causes mild disease in four in five patients, says WHO [The Guardian, 17 Feb '20]",2020-02-17 15:59:54,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f5icpt/coronavirus_causes_mild_disease_in_four_in_five/

There is only the public information through the Phuket office of the Public Relations Department [PR Phuket], which receives orders from Phuket Governor Phakaphong Tavipatana only,” Chief Thanit said.“This is by order of the Ministry of Health in Bangkok to not give out any information,” Chief Thanit added.Over the past three weeks, the daily virus-situation update briefings in Phuket have degenerated into nothing more than public relations announcements by officials explaining what basic actions action are being taken in terms of public-awareness campaigns and cleaning exercises.The report last Friday (Feb 14) of passengers disembarking the Seabourne Ovation cruise liner which had arrived in Phuket was the first since Jan 31 to explain exactly who was being tested by whom.At that event, Phuket Governor Phakaphong Tavipatana confirmed that there were still no confirmed cases of people infected with the coronavirus in Phuket. (See story here.)The last report by officials recognising any persons as under observation on suspicion of being infected came on Jan 31, when Vachira Phuket Hospital Director Dr Chalermpong announced that six more tourists in Phuket were under observation.However, Dr Chalermpong stressed, “They are only suspected of being infected, and are under observation only.”The six new cases brought to 29 the total number of people in Phuket held for observation since officials started scanning new arrivals for elevated body temperatures on Jan 5.Of those, 19 had been already discharged from hospitals, Dr Chalermpong said on Jan 31, adding that the remaining 10 are in hospital care: eight at Vachira Phuket Hospital, one at Patong Hospital and one at Thalang Hospital. (See story here.)Meanwhile, while the daily update briefings have been held between 9am and 11am each day, the reports are not being made available on the PR Phuket official Facebook page until late afternoon to early evening. (See Facebook page here.)THE AIRPORT￼The Health Control Division at Phuket airport today also declined to publicly clarify which passengers arriving or departing Phuket were being screened for elevated body temperatures.PR Phuket reports have repeatedly claimed that all passengers inbound and outbound are being screened, with passengers arriving directly from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao not even allowed inside the terminal until they have been screened for fever. (See story here.)However, The Phuket News has received multiple first hand reports of passengers arriving from a variety of locations confirming that they were not screened at all on landing at Phuket airport.THE SILENCEDr Sirilak Thaichareon, Director of the regional Disease Prevention and Control office has yet to reply to requests from The Phuket News for clarification of Phuket’s current situation regarding the virus outbreak.Vague national updates are provided through Bangkok officials each day, with the Ministry of Tourism and Sports sharing posts by the Ministry of Public Health’s Department of Disease Control (DDC).As of yesterday (Feb 16), the DDC reported that Thailand had identified 35 confirmed cases of people infected with the coronavirus. Of those, 15 had recovered and been discharged from hospital care, while the remaining 20 were still receiving treatment in hospitalAlso as of yesterday, the DDC reported that Thailand had 837 cases of people suspected of being infected, with 55 cases detected by airport screenings – though it has not been explained exactly at which airports these people were identified as infected.The remaining 782 cases were people who had presented themselves at hospitals and sought medical service on their own at hospital, the DDC noted.Of the 821 suspected infections, 703 have been cleared and the patients allowed to return home, whether home be here in Thailand or abroad, while the remaining 134 remain under hospital observation, the DDC reported.The daily reports do not indicate where or when the suspected cases were identified.The MoTS urges people to check the DDC latest “viral pneumonia” report webpage for people to get the latest updates.

Since last week, the Japanese government including the ministry of health has finally and reluctantly instructed to expand the test capability per a day/ week, though the speed of its expansion is rapid. Until then, however, [this English article of Japantimes](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/12/national/science-health/japan-covid-19-test-kit-shortage-cruise-ship/) reports that they really had the capability of PCR testing at most 300 samples per a day. While the accuracy of the media (Japantimes), especially in the last few years, tend to be overestimated out of Japan, I can confirm this description with other Japanese news. I also suppose that the test capacity of USA before Feb. 05 (the beginning of sending out the new test kit) had been little different from that of Japan.  As for other background (i.e. the government's reluctance to add further number of the confirmed so that Olympic is no longer regarded as safe), I cannot comment here due to the lack of trustworthy accounts (though I personally suspect so).","Japan boosts virus testing capabilities - NHK WORLD-JAPAN News - Feb. 18, 2020",2020-02-17 17:07:30,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f5jave/japan_boosts_virus_testing_capabilities_nhk/

That’s a fatality rate of 2.3 percent. Figures released on a daily basis suggest the rate has further increased in recent days.That is far higher than the mortality rate of the seasonal flu, with which the new coronavirus has sometimes been compared.In the United States, flu fatality rates hover around 0.1 percent.The new analysis was posted online by researchers at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Over all, about 81 percent of patients with confirmed diagnoses experienced mild illness, the researchers found. Nearly 14 percent had severe cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and about 5 percent had critical illness.Thirty percent of those who died were in their 60s, 30 percent were in their 70s and 20 percent were age 80 or older. Though men and women were roughly equally represented among the confirmed cases, men made up nearly 64 percent of the deaths. Patients with underlying medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, died at higher rates.The fatality rate among patients in Hubei Province, the center of China’s outbreak, was more than seven times higher than that of other provinces.China on Tuesday announced new figures for the outbreak.

fi0eqvg,0.8808,-0.6542,"For comparison, here is the day by day description of symptoms and treatment (from day 1 through day 12) for the first patient in the USA, a 35 year old male. He required supplemental oxygen.He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and “remains isolated at home.”) see;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-02-04/first-us-coronavirus-patient-released-from-hospital%3fcontext=amp(Please also see these relevant links contributed by r/u/Two_Luffas: The JAMA related to the first story: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044Here's the Lancet case study from Jan. 24 : https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltextThe NEJM case study, but includes all of the relevant supporting documents: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191Another Lancet case study: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930211-7/fulltextLancet case study from Nepal: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30067-0/fulltext)","Lancet: study of COVID-19 patient; 50 year-old received antivirals lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon alfa-2b, as well as HFNC oxygen therapy, but died on day six of hospitalization",2020-02-17 22:16:52,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f5nc1q/lancet_study_of_covid19_patient_50_yearold/

fi07qtp,0.9931,-0.0686,"I find it unfortunate that in so many comment sections like on YouTube, their Facebook page, etc people are spouting conspiracy stuff like the Japanese are trying to silence them, etc. First, let's get this out of the way - them going silent simply means there is no nearby WiFi AP and their UK mobile phone does not have a subscription that can connect to Japanese mobile networks. That is why they do not have internet access at the present - there is no indication they are being silenced or censored by the Japanese. Also, just to be clear it appears they were taken to a university hospital - not a hostel. I can see why David might've thought it looked like a hostel at first but it IS a medical facility with medical staff.One of the concerns David expressed days ago was that the Japanese doctors wouldn't speak English. Well, since they are now in a university teaching hospital by the looks of it I'd say it's incredibly likely that there will be student doctors there that know English since Japanese students at university often will go abroad to English speaking countries for part of their education. So David should have no issue communicating his dietary needs and medical needs re: diabetes to the doctors.And if he develops symptoms and needs more advanced care that he can't get from a university teaching hospital they will transfer him to an ICU somewhere in Japan I'm sure. Yes, being split up is always a possibility because of logistical reasons. Each hospital no matter how advanced a country is only has so many ICUs that can double as quarantine rooms. So it is hard enough to find room for one person at a time, trying to house two people in the same facility just adds more burden when time is of the essence. See this video for photos of the facility they were taken to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVmvLaLcYq4It looks like a fairly new building and I'm sure the Japanese are doing their best to take care of them and the others. Remember, the Japanese are doing this out of their own pockets and there are only so many hospitals in Japan - it is not a large country. Even in the U.S. it would be a struggle to find 3,000 Intensive care units to house passengers and crew from a ship. It's a logistical nightmare. So I wish certain people wouldn't hate on Japan because everything I see so far shows me they are doing their best.

I didn't really like David at first, I thought he was a pompus brit revelling in his 15 minutes of fame and using it to get selfish things like whiskey and coffee, while the crew were suffering in much worse conditions.. that said, over time I noticed his pompus front was just that, a front he put on. I really didn't like seeing him falling victim to trolls, especially when they switched to youtube. The cough he's had and then his wife got was a dead giveaway, but he was in denial, trying to blame the air conditioner.. in a way I think he was probably right, in that the air condtioner probably delivered infected air, either that or the crew did when delivering items to rooms. I'm worried because of his age and also diabeties he is very high risk, really they both are. I have no idea how Japans health system is coping with all these elderly confirmed cases. It's a shame but it was inevitable. I think ultimately it was the wrong decision to quarantine them all on the ship, it basically sentenced everyone to contract the virus at the expense of.. what exactly? The virus has already spread in Tokyo anyway. At least if they'd let them go, vast vast majority wouldn't have been infected and would have gone back to their home countries.

The country increased imports of meat and offal by almost 50% in 2019 to a record of about 6.2 million tons, customs data show.It remains unclear when port operations will return to normal as truck drivers returning from other cities are quarantined for 14 days and other transport restrictions on trucks remain in place, the people said.The government encouraged factories to ramp up production this week after extended New Year holidays. Outbreaks of the virus have sickened more than 70,000 and killed over 1,800 in China.
