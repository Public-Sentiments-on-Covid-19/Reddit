That virus probably replicated to some extent within you. However, YOU don’t get sick.  You are asymptotic.When they talk about asymptotic in news reports (e.g. 14 people test positive but have no fever or respiratory symptoms), it is an open question whether the people testing positive will eventually become ill.

fi28xia,0.9981,0.0,"I mean, you bring up a point I didn't think about. Big companies' corporate staff don't care about you, me, their own people, or anyone else. They, as you stated, only care about the next dollar. There are so, so many factories that support corporations' cheap habits. These guys hate wasting even a single day losing money. So their choices are to rake in $0 from imports that are completely cut off, or use American labor and resources at a MUCH higher cost. Which for sure means more money in the pockets of American people, and more jobs for us to keep up with demand. We all know their lives won't be ruined, but they'll have less power. I know these are the obvious choices everyone can see, but I also know that there are possibly many other solutions corporations have they could slide into. A few factors that got me thinking: Does America have the correct and able means of production that these corporations need? If not, they'd have to build a whole new factory. Do I think they would do that? Spend more on a plant/setup to also spend more in wages? Honestly, I don't know, but I can guess, no. How long will these quarantines last? Long enough to make a difference in the American people's lives? Probably not. What good would, per say, hiring 10,000/100,000 new workers to help meet the astronomical and widespread demand of products, matching China's output? Probably no good. Thousands would be laid off as soon as China can get back to production. Which could cause a huge economic crisis. Idk if American facilities can match China's endless variation of products. Maybe they can, which is a super good thing. Maybe American companies don't need to create more jobs to meet demand. Maybe they will keep what personnel they have and just up output. That would be beneficial to Americans that are the makeup of that company only, but, to me, creating more jobs is more important. Yes, it's wonderful Americans from the ground up within said companies would earn more, but it would just be a better outcome if America had more jobs as a whole. It's like.....between you and your brother, you have an excellent job that you were able acquire, and for some reason, your brother just got laid off and cant find a decent job. Let's say that you both are an equal employee and create equal return on investment. You have equal education, equal experience, and equal drive. You tell your brother about your awesome company, and you want to get him a job. Your boss says he'll help out if a position opens up, you're a great worker and have put in the time, always reliable, too, so having 2 of you would be a win all around. Then the far above scenario: production all of a sudden meets more demand, more money is flooded into your company and into your pocket. You're working to produce more products gaining more experience, but for some reason...new job openings just don't seem to be in the works. You have to tell your brother that instead of helping him make something of himself and become established again, you can actually do nothing and instead you got a raise. Your brother can find a new job somewhere else, yes, he's not a freeloader, but it will be in something other than what you two have experience in, it could take a while to land something as fruitful as his last job, and more applicants would potentially be aiming at the same position as your brother, creating a more highly competitive job market for everyone. Which is good, the best man needs have the job, but it's harder on everyone else who are worthy and deserving but slightly less qualified. Idk I'm ranting now.","Coronavirus could impact 5 million companies worldwide, new research shows",2020-02-18 04:40:24,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f5r71j/coronavirus_could_impact_5_million_companies/

Japan is also canceling group gatherings and activities in the affected areas, so no 40,000 person dinner to spread the disease around.The downside is that they acted slow in responding to the situation, so it is self propagating in several locations at the same time.

The fact that one source is 100 taxi drivers, and their families, that attended a dinner, and the second source is possibly a hospital, are the two worst sources that could be had.  Taxis transport, and hospitals are where those with already compromised immune systems go.  And given the diseases tendency to shed before symptoms, it has legs and Japan doesn't yet know how far it has gotten.  Japan has transparency on their side, but their lax reaction is the main issue.  They need to start testing in larger circles around the infected, and start proper quarantine procedures.

fi0grca,-0.9624,0.4019,"Its likely the same strain and it all comes down to how good your immune system is at fighting it off.  All sorts of variables play into that from the amount of virus you are exposed to initially to your current health.  Example if your exposure is one tiny tiny droplet with a tiny tiny amount of virus its possible your immune system  starts the fight before the virus can multiply and gain a foothold and you end up with very minor symptoms to no symptoms at all. Its kind of how live vaccines worked, inject a super tiny controlled amount of attenuated virus and let the body learn to fight it off.   But if a large quantity of viral particles get in to your system either in one exposure or repeated accumulating exposures the immune response will have to be much larger and more systemic to kill it off.  Fever is one way your body fights off infections basically making your body a hostile environment to the invader by raising the temperature.   Another aspect is have you ever been sick with a similar virus so your immune system is quicker to identify and respond to it as being an invader even though this is a different virus.None of these aspects can be known, so its basically a crap shoot for any individual.",The number of detected corona infections on Diamond princess cruise ship increases drastically,2020-02-18 05:18:38,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f5ro3j/the_number_of_detected_corona_infections_on/

fi0epyo,0.9722,-0.0772,"Transcript:  (fixed d-mat references, thanks u/honeight)Hello my name is professor [Kentaro Iwata](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyj-zWW1MZIukBF7Aqrj0VA) **I am a specialist of infectious diseases** at Kobe University Hospital, Kobe Japan.Today I entered into the cruise ship Diamond Princess which is bombarded by a-lot of COVID 19 infection right now and I was removed from the ship on the same day and I'm going to talk to you why this happened.I was very concerned of the number of the people who got infected with COVID 19 disease infections.  Then I was wondering why this is happening, I wanted to enter into the cruise ship and wanted to be useful in helping to containing infection there I spoke with several people and finally the one officer at working for Ministry of Health and Labor called me yesterday saying that well you can come and enter into a cruise ship and do the infection control work and I said fine, then I prepared my stuff and I did all the paperwork's and arrangement and they got in onto the Shinkansen? from Kobe to Yokohama all the way to go to YokohamaI got another call from the same officer say that somebody didn't like me so do you can't get into the cruise ship. He was not able to say who and he was not able to say why but certainly some power over him affected his decision and I was blocked from entering into the ship then after several discussions he found another way that if you could come as a DMAT team member you can come in at into the cruise ship.   DMAT is the disaster management medical team in Japan and usually deals with disaster not infectious diseases but because of the lack of the people who could help people inside a cruise ship to get out of the ship or the managing of people and the swan song DMAT was requested to enter in the cruise ship because my specialty is not a disaster managementSo I was not very happy about that, but because we have no other way I said fine I'll do that. Additionally I got another call that some people didn't like me getting into the cruise ship present even as a DMAT member.  Another discussion happened then the I waited about our one hour in shin-yokohama sessions and finally the officer find a way that if you work for DMAT not as an infection prevention specialist, but as the ordinary routine Diamond officer working under wounded team at doctor doing a routine job then you could come into the cruise ship.I was not very happy with that decision but because there's no other way so I said finding out get into the ship I entered the ship then I found the chief officer of the DMAT and spoke with him I said well I was assigned to the DMAT members or the out whatever you want to say they hes  well you don't have to work team DMAT work because that's not your specialty and you are an infection prevention specialist so why don't you do the infection control then I said fineI spoke with the superior of him who is in charge of the DMAT operations and he also said that you are infection control person so you should do infection control I said fine but he said well you shouldn't be here as a DMAT member you should come as the along to infection control specialist he was not very happy about while I was inside a DMAT but because that was not my decision there was no other way so he I said well I have to do it***I looked into the several places inside the ship and the turned out that the cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of the infection control there was no distinction between the Green Zone which is the free of infection and the Red Zone which is potentially contaminated by virus.***So the people could come and go wearing a PPE of PPE crews were just walking around and the officers of ministry the health and the labor was walking around, DMAT people are walking around, psychiatrists are walking around, and people were eating in one place, people were wearing PPE and off PPE and eating lunch with their gloves on and just dealing with the smart phone with full PPE so it was completely chaotic and some crews had a fever they went to the medical center while wearing and N95 masks but he didn't have any protection between his room and a medical room and the medical officer was not protecting herself and that she was very happy saying that well she was already infected I'm sure about that, so the she was completely giving up protecting herself anywaysI dealt with a lots of infections more than twenty years and I was in Africa dealing with the Ebola outbreak, I was in another country is dealing with the cholera outbreak I was in China in 2003 to deal with the SARS, and I saw many febrile patient there.  I never had fear of getting infection myself, for Ebola, SARS, cholera because I know how to protect myself and how to protect others and how the infection control should be.So I could do the adequate infection control protect myself and protect others.  but inside Princess Diamond I was so scared, I was so scared of getting COVID-19 because there was no way to tell where the virus is.  No green zone no red zone everywhere could have Virus and everybody was not careful about it.  There was no single professional infection control person inside the ship and that there was nobody in charge of infection prevention as a professional.The bureaucrats were in charge of everything and I spoke with the head officer of the Ministry of Health on labor and he was very unhappy with my suggestion of protecting DMAT people and other staffs so that no other secondary transmission to occur then after several hours of talking to people and finding problems I found a lot of issues there for example informed consent of getting a PCR from the people in the ship was on a paper and that paper was going back and forth back and forth with the room of the infection from the paper by touching there.So I suggested that maybe it's better to abandon the paper type informed consent but resolutely getting the informed consent probably would be more protective so on so on so yeah I,  I think I was reasonable, and I never yell at anybody, and I never criticize anybody personally,  but I was trying to be constructive but we try to seek the constructive but immediate improvement to protect everybody inside the shipThen about five o'clock the person from the quarantine office came in and approached said well you have to be out because you will not be allowed to inside of ship because I was inside ship as the temporary officer of the  quarantine that he apparently my my rank was removed by somebody and then nobody said who that the I was out. And the officer who offered me the job of infection control said he was sorry then I asked him so what do you want to do then do you want to infect everybody in the ship?  it will be your thousands of people who could potentially get COVID-19.I don' t criticize DMAT people they were not infection control specialists, Society of infection prevention entered the, a lot of specialists came in but they spend only a few days and to left. And they said they were fearful of getting infections themselves. I share the same fear because I'm in the same room now and I separated from my family I'm very scared of getting infection myself and I'm very scared of infecting my family too.I'll be out of my medical services at Kobe University Hospital for maybe next two weeks to avoid further infections to occur that is very likely to occur if you keep zero infection control inside the ship that brings us like this.You might know that there is no CDC in Japan but I thought there must be some specialists called on and was in charge of infection control in ship it's not expecting ***nobody was professional infection control specialist and the only the bureaucrats were doing the jobs completely layman's work in the violating all the infection control principles and the risking people inside further infections so I'm not very surprised to see many new positive PCR's to be broadcasted every day*** hundreds of people got infected and the lot of people from outside Japan decided to take the people away from the ship and bring them to their home countries by airplane and offered them another 14 days of quarantine. I hope this will be the opportunity to raise a question what is happening inside ship.I wish all the international bodies to request Japan to change. I wish everybody to call for protection of people inside the Diamond Princess. Otherwise there will be far more infections for passengers for crews for Diamond members for psychiatrist for officer of the Ministry of Health and labor DMAT member consists of nurses and doctors and that they will go back to the hospital they work routinely and it's a much infected their patients further to spread and the disease.I can't bear with it, I can't bear with it, I think we have to change we have to do something about these crews and we have to help people inside the ship their safety and their life.Again I am professor [Kentaro Iwata](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyj-zWW1MZIukBF7Aqrj0VA) of infection this infectious disease specialist thank you for listening.Edit: Thank you to u/honeight for the DMAT definition confirmation.

fi52kfg,-0.6908,0.0," How to calculate the mortality rate during an outbreak The case fatality rate (CFR) represents the proportion of cases who eventually die from a disease.**Once an epidemic has ended**, it is calculated with the formula: **deaths / cases**.But **while an epidemic is still ongoing**, as it is the case with the current novel coronavirus outbreak, **this formula is, at the very least, ""naïve""**  and can be ""**misleading** if, at the time of analysis, the outcome is unknown for a non negligible proportion of patients."" \[[8](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#ref-8)\]([Methods for Estimating the Case Fatality Ratio for a Novel, Emerging Infectious Disease](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/162/5/479/82647) \- Ghani et al, American Journal of Epidemiology).    In other words, **current deaths belong to a total case figure of the past, not to the current case figure** in which the outcome (recovery or death) of a proportion (the most recent cases) hasn't yet been determined.The correct formula, therefore, would appear to be:**CFR = deaths at day.x / cases at day.x-{T}**   *(where T = average time period from case confirmation to death)*This would constitute a fair attempt to use values for **cases and deaths belonging to the same group of patients**.One  issue can be that of determining whether there is enough data to  estimate T with any precision, but it is certainly not T = 0 (what is  implicitly used when applying the formula current deaths / current cases  to determine CFR during an ongoing outbreak). Let's take, for example, the data at the end of February 8, 2020: **813 deaths** (cumulative total) and **37,552 cases** (cumulative total) worldwide. If we use the formula (deaths / cases) we get:813 / 37,552 = 2.2% CFR (flawed formula).With  a conservative estimate of T = 7 days as the average period from case  confirmation to death, we would correct the above formula by using  February 1 cumulative cases, which were 14,381, in the denominator:**Feb. 8 deaths** / **Feb. 1 cases** = 813 / 14,381 = **5.7% CFR** (correct formula, and estimating T=7).T  could be estimated by simply looking at the value of (current total  deaths + current total recovered) and pair it with a case total in the  past that has the same value. For the above formula, the matching dates  would be January 26/27, providing an estimate for T of 12 to 13 days.  This method of estimating T uses the same logic of the following method,  and therefore will yield the same result. An alternative method, which has the advantage of not having to estimate a variable, and that is mentioned in the [American Journal of Epidemiology study](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/162/5/479/82647)  cited previously as a simple method that nevertheless could work  reasonably well if the hazards of death and recovery at any time *t* measured from admission to the hospital, conditional on an event occurring at time *t*, are proportional, would be to use the formula:**CFR = deaths / (deaths + recovered)**which, with [the latest data available](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), would be equal to:**2,122 / (2,122 + 15,893) = 12% CFR (worldwide)**[**https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#correct**](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#correct)",Where does the 82% Mild Figure Come From?,2020-02-18 09:12:45,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f5v2co/where_does_the_82_mild_figure_come_from/

I guess one thing it does not entail is an actual individual who has tested positive. Oddly, they are not under public health supervision. What it includes per their own definition is “The number of people under public health supervision includes those at risk of having been exposed to novel coronavirus who are monitoring their health under the supervision of public health officials. This number includes close contacts of laboratory confirmed cases, as well as people who have returned from China in the past 14 days and are included in federal quarantine guidance.”So those at risk who are monitoring their [own] health “under the supervision of public health officials”.  Clear as mud.  What does the self monitoring entail (self isolation?  Looking in the mirror for indications of zombie ness?). What does Supervision by the officials entail?  I did find this on Washington state website “Public health officials regularly ask people who may have been exposed to a communicable disease to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. While local health officers in Washington State have the authority for quarantine orders, the vast majority of people we ask are willing to follow public health recommendations and quarantine themselves. We can often help if someone can’t leave their house and needs services or other support, like grocery delivery or talking with their employer.”",Over 700 people in Washington under public health supervision due to coronavirus,2020-02-18 09:52:43,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f5vpfn/over_700_people_in_washington_under_public_health/

Work would resume at different pace according to the district; the 4 largest districts should take health safety as priority, and gradually resume work; all other district should resume work with full force if health risks can be managed.2. Readjusting road traffic control: with the exception of inter-city, inter-province, and highway entrance checkpoints, all other traffic checkpoints would be removed.3. Readjusting closed-off management policy on residential complexes, it is not allowed to restrict residents that rent houses, residental complex management offices may no longer control entrance via handing entrance passes; exiting of people and vehicles should be allowed.4. Utilize electronic platforms such as ""宁归来"" to differentiate migrant workers with labels of ""Red, Orange, Green"" depending on the risk level of where they come from.5. Accelerate the progress of resuming work; for those businesses that have completed requirement for disease control and protection, they may resume work as soon as they submit application to request for resuming work. Local governments should actively help local businesses with problems such as lack of human labor, material supply/delivery, health-related equipments, etc. Movie theatres, internet cafes, \[...and a bunch other entertainment places...\], and other indoor, high-human-density businesses and regions should not resume work right now, no group dine-in for restaurant businesses.6. Promote resuming of construction projects; if health and disease-prevention obligations can be fulfilled, major City and Province construction projects should fully resume work, and others should begin gradually resuming work; the construction site and on-site living quarters should use closed-off management.7. Expand available public service; gradually resume cross-city, cross-province passenger transport service, and increase capacity of city public transportation; resume real-estate trades and businesses; public facilities such as parks and outdoor sport facilities should be opened to public; outdoor tourist spots should resume opening, but traffic density should be controlled.8. Secure supply of medical supplies; with the exception of oral clinics, optic clinics, otorhinolaryngology clinics, and cosmetic clinics, that should continue suspending treatment; only necessary emergency medical services for those listed should remain open; all other departments should resume operation.9. Continue using protection when outdoors; continue the requirement of wearing masks and set up temperature checkpoints outdoors; citizens should keep distance with each other and avoid large group activities.10. Strengthen monitoring of government efforts; all levels and departments of government should base their decisions on actual circumstances; no ""one side fits all"" approach to enacting policies; no arbitrary escalation of restrictions. Local governments should notify businesses of their disease control obligations ahead of time, and enforce them afterwards.

fi2riov,0.9571,-0.4588,"Wuhan had already figured it out in 2010!&#x200B;Abstract: *The discovery of SARS-like coronavirus in bats suggests that bats could be the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. However, previous studies indicated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, a known SARS-CoV receptor, from a horseshoe bat was unable to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Here, we extended our previous study to ACE2 molecules from seven additional bat species and tested their interactions with human SARS-CoV spike protein using both HIV-based pseudotype and live SARS-CoV infection assays. The results show that ACE2s of Myotis daubentoni and Rhinolophus sinicus support viral entry mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein, albeit with different efficiency in comparison to that of the human ACE2. Further, the alteration of several key residues either decreased or enhanced bat ACE2 receptor efficiency, as predicted from a structural modeling study of the different bat ACE2 molecules. These data suggest that M. daubentoni and R. sinicus are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV and may be candidates as the natural host of the SARS-CoV progenitor viruses. Furthermore, our current study also demonstrates that the genetic diversity of ACE2 among bats is greater than that observed among known SARS-CoV susceptible mammals, highlighting the possibility that there are many more uncharacterized bat species that can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV or its progenitor viruses. This calls for continuation and expansion of field surveillance studies among different bat populations to eventually identify the true natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.*",Scientists hit back at rumours humans engineered the deadly contagion,2020-02-18 15:24:11,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f60z8t/scientists_hit_back_at_rumours_humans_engineered/

fi289l1,-0.7298,0.0,"[WHO Pandemic Phases](https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/h5n1phase/en/)In Phase 1 no viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infections in humans.In Phase 2 an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat.In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks.” The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.Phase 5 is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.Phase 6, the pandemic phase, is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5.

fi2a9td,-0.997,0.0,"“It’s important to know that calling a disease outbreak a pandemic doesn’t connote severity. The term relates solely to the amount of ground the outbreak covers.” - From: https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/12/understanding-pandemics-what-they-mean-coronavirus/Understanding pandemics: What they mean, don’t mean, and what comes next with the coronavirusBy HELEN BRANSWELL @HelenBranswellFEBRUARY 12, 2020The word “pandemic” is not a comforting one.And yet it is increasingly being bandied about in connection with the spread of the novel coronavirus that emerged from China.U.S. health officials have been signaling for nearly two weeks now that a coronavirus pandemic may be on the horizon. While stressing that the virus presents only a “low risk” to Americans right now, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, acknowledged Tuesday that that might not remain the case for long.“Is there a risk that this is going to turn into a global pandemic? Absolutely, yes,” Fauci said.But what is a pandemic? And if efforts like the quarantining of returning travelers cannot stop spread of the virus, what will? We’re peering into the unknown here, but given the ease with which this coronavirus seems to transmit from person to person, the world is likely to see much broader international spread of the virus, now known as SARS-CoV-2. (The disease the virus causes has been named Covid-19.)Here’s what you need to know about pandemics.What is a pandemic?A disease doesn’t have to infect all of the globe to be a pandemic. Lots of people, over broad swaths of territory, will suffice.The World Health Organization defines pandemic as the worldwide spread of a new disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a definition that is a bit more elastic, describing it as a disease that spreads across regions.The word is most commonly used in the context of influenza. Flu pandemics occur when new flu strains emerge from nature — say a swine flu virus or a flu strain circulating among chickens — and start infecting people. But other diseases can and have been declared pandemics.It’s important to know that calling a disease outbreak a pandemic doesn’t connote severity. The term relates solely to the amount of ground the outbreak covers.There can be mild pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic; it killed roughly as many people as regular flu, though many were younger than those who succumb to seasonal flu.At the opposite end of the severity spectrum from the 2009 pandemic was the 1918 Spanish flu. The poster child for a bad pandemic, it killed between 50 million and 100 million around the globe in 1918-1919.Other flu pandemics from the era of modern virology — 1957, 1968 — looked a lot more like 2009 than 1918.When was the last pandemic? When was the last pandemic caused by a coronavirus?The last pandemic was the aforementioned 2009 H1N1 outbreak. As for when or whether there has been a coronavirus pandemic before, that’s not known.There are four coronaviruses that are endemic in people, meaning they circulate in an ongoing manner. You likely don’t know their names because they mostly cause colds; they’re among the multitude of viruses that swarm around us during cold and flu season. (They’re known as OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1.)They were all formerly animal viruses but crossed over to infect people before the existence of viruses was recognized. As a result, there is no record of how rapidly they spread when they first started infecting people and whether they caused severe disease before settling down to become causes of the common cold.Two other animal coronaviruses have crossed into people in the past two decades, SARS and MERS. SARS spread to a number of countries around the world but the virus was snuffed out after about 8,000 cases and nearly 800 deaths. MERS, which still jumps to people from camels, has mainly infected people on the Arabian Peninsula. Neither is considered to have caused a pandemic.Who would declare a pandemic?An official declaration would come from the WHO, though the agency may be reluctant to unleash this term anytime soon.The WHO was harshly criticized when the 2009 flu pandemic turned out to be much less severe than people had feared. Rather than feeling relieved the pandemic wasn’t causing large numbers of deaths, people felt aggrieved they’d been scared over something they later concluded was far less scary than expected. And governments that had contacts to buy pandemic vaccine — contracts that were triggered by the WHO’s declaration — were left on the hook for vaccine many people didn’t want.In other words, the term can be a loaded one. But if this virus is discovered to be spreading in an unstoppable fashion in countries on several continents, infectious disease experts will use the P word — whether the WHO officially declares a pandemic or not.Should the outbreak be declared a pandemic now?There currently isn’t evidence that the virus is spreading out of control in many places outside of China. That said, it’s currently challenging to know how much transmission is going on outside of China because a lot of infections appear to be quite mild and thus easy to miss.Until recently only two laboratories in Africa — one in Senegal, the other in South Africa — were able to test for the new coronavirus, known provisionally as SARS-CoV-2, which was previously known as 2019-nCoV. Late last week the WHO shipped testing reagents to labs in a number of African countries. So far no African countries have reported cases; but given the strong links between China and many African countries, they may find cases soon.But aren’t there cases in a lot of places?Roughly 24 countries have diagnosed infections, and the overall numbers are growing. Most of the cases still are in tourists from China or people who had recently been in China. But increasingly countries are reporting cases of “secondary spread” — that is, cases in which a person who hadn’t traveled to China contracted the virus from someone who had. Some of those secondary cases are spreading the virus as well.From: https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/the-latest-on-the-coronavirus/“A number of experts, including Marc Lipsitch, think that the novel coronavirus will soon become a pandemic—meaning that it will spread across regions. But it’s still unclear how severe such a pandemic would be.”",What is a pandemic?

fi2h7zm,-0.9346,-0.6808,"Saved you a click:Worries are growing that the economic impact from the novel coronavirus outbreak will be worse than expected and that markets are being too complacent in factoring it in as a risk.What's happening: The number of confirmed cases has already far outpaced expectations and even those reports are being viewed through a lens of suspicion that the Chinese government is underreporting the figures.Yet, U.S. stock indexes have continued to hit all-time highs, bond spreads remain compressed, and even some Asian bourses have recouped losses that followed the initial coronavirus headlines.Driving the news: Of the 364 companies that have held Q4 earnings calls, 138 cited the term “coronavirus” during the call, and about 25% of those included some impact from the coronavirus or modified guidance due to the virus, according to FactSet.Apple was the latest, saying Monday it would not meet quarterly revenue expectations due to limited iPhone production and Chinese demand.What they're saying: ""This will eventually end badly. I have never in my career seen anything as crazy as what’s going on right now,"" Scott Minerd, global CIO of Guggenheim Investments, writes in a note. ""The cognitive dissonance in the credit market is stunning.""He's not alone: ""The ramp up in China will take much longer than many expect because of the need to prevent a secondary flare up in contagion,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said on Twitter.She echoed concerns from Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian.The state of play: ""By most estimates, if the Chinese extend the lunar new year by two weeks it would not meaningfully impact the global supply chain, but if it went beyond two weeks then we would start to see problems for materials and consumer goods outside of China,"" Minerd argues.Between the lines: It's been about two weeks and things don't look great.Hong Kong, already coping with the economic damage from its months-long protests, now is facing wide-ranging shortages of basic household and cooking supplies.High-tech industrial parks in Chinese manufacturing hubs like Shenzhen have just reopened but are facing a ""severe"" worker shortage, as many are stuck in their hometowns and factories remain idle.Details: Minerd predicts that the ""impact of all this on corporate profits and free cash flow will be dramatic,"" warning that China's first quarter GDP could fall as low as -6% annualized in the first quarter and oil could drop to $25 a barrel.The bottom line: ""We are either moving into a completely new paradigm, or the speculative energy in the market is incredibly out of control,"" Minerd says.""I think it is the latter. I have said before that we have entered the silly season, but I stand corrected. We are in the ludicrous season.""",Economists warn coronavirus risk far worse than realized,2020-02-18 16:43:35,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f625wu/economists_warn_coronavirus_risk_far_worse_than/

fi3nl8j,-0.8678,0.0,"I'm interested on what basis this is propaganda?There's acceptance that there's most likely under-reporting of cases worldwide, although not to the extent that is being wildly reported. There's analysis from most countries around what incidence rates you would see from different countries based on traffic between China, other affected areas and the countries themselves. A lot of the language used with official reports, statements and media releases are talking about containment, they're putting up the fences.To put it into an Australian vernacular, there's an explosion of rabbit numbers in an area and we need to get a fence up quickly. The first few rabbits caught are fairly big and hairy so we start our rabbit-proof fence quickly using the readily available chicken/chain wire with fairly wide spacing because it's the most common.Then we find that actually there's a bunch of smaller rabbits getting through, a bit unusual for rabbits so we have to quickly hunt down all the available smaller spaced chicken/chain wire and quickly add that. Turns out some field mice we've been letting through are actually rabbits so now we have to regrade everything again.Every time we catch more and more things getting through the rabbit proof fence our ability to identify and correct the fence improves. We've also got to round up the critters who got through. Some parts of the fence have been put up better than others. Some parts haven't really been put up at all but the people near those bits insist that they haven't seen any rabbits except in the distance. Everyone else is asking to see the ""land birds"" that they've been catching just to make sure they don't hop like a rabbit.We also have surveillance along the fence so we can see exactly what's going on and double check any dubious critters. We're not checking insects because, well they're insects, or lizards or amphibians and so on. We are looking out for rabbits or anything rabbit-like and have now changed the definition of what a rabbit or potential rabbit might be.In terms of propaganda it doesn't make sense to hide the numbers. Hiding the numbers will eventually get out, it always does especially if it goes to pandemic or if there's a sudden unexplainable outbreak in an area or two. It's a zero sum game because if the hidden numbers gets out then suddenly all trust is gone and it's more likely to cause a panic rather than lessen it. On the flip side being open with the numbers reduces the likelihood of panic. There's been an argument that numbers are reduced to limit panic in the community, however, risk communication tells us over and over again that it does not work. Think about the best public communicators and they are generally the most open and authentic.There's certainly an argument that Australia could have a more Singapore-like communication style and their PM's public address to the nation is a prime example of risk communication done well.",NSW Health (State in Australia) says it has not been able to make contact with four out of the 22 Australians who returned from a cruise ship that docked in Cambodia last week amid concerns passengers could have the coronavirus.,2020-02-18 18:12:11,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f63fhx/nsw_health_state_in_australia_says_it_has_not/

fi35mh3,-0.111,-0.2584,"The interesting thing about the UK reporting, is that we still release the number of negative tests.So either the confirmed case number isn't being reported, or we have been exceedingly lucky/unlucky depending on your view and we haven't had any additional detections.If we look at the R0, and the idea that 60-80% of cases outside the hot zones might be unreported, the idea that there are no more cases on the island seems a bit far-fetched. Just looking at the R0, and taking a conservative estimate of it at R2, you'd expect there to be at least eighteen undetected cases on average; for small outbreaks of the disease you can test those closest to the patient, and widen the circle out to include those with incidental contact over time. You might get lucky and catch every case this way; you might easily miss a contact transmission from bodily fluids on a surface to a complete stranger.That's where I suspect we are now; the tests the UK are reporting represent the 9 patients family, colleagues, extended social circles and a proportion of hospital admissions of unrelated cases presenting with pneumonia or covid-like symptoms.We haven't found any others to report as yet, but that in no way means there aren't more cases in the community, and over time, if this is as infectious as it seems, we'll see more cases growing from these clusters.",Coronavirus data from countries outside China still not being shared with WHO,2020-02-18 18:27:24,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f63na7/coronavirus_data_from_countries_outside_china/

Usually, you would return home for winter or summer vacation without any problem. But if you were careless and caught an infectious virus like SARS, you’d have to undergo enclosed, isolated treatment, because it’s an infectious illness. If you weren’t thoroughly cured, as soon as you returned home you would infect your family with this virus, and your whole family would fall. The party and government would not be so irresponsible that they would let a member of your family go home before their illness was cured and thinking thoroughly transformed, a situation in which they would do harm to others. I don’t think that you would talk lightly about coming home either.“https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-detention-directive.html“11. My family has a lot of things to deal with and their length of time in re-education is a bit long. Is there any way their study period could be shortened?If you’re worried that nobody is around to take care of your family and so won’t accept the training, that’s being irresponsible to your family and to society. Your family member’s thinking has been infected with a “virus,” and they definitely need swift “residential treatment” before illness breaks out and before they head down the road of criminality. One day sooner in eradicating this “malignant tumor” in their thinking means one day sooner that they may return to their family and society. Don’t ever take a happy-go-lucky attitude or become phobic about treating diseases and skip this optimum time for treatment. That’s how a small illness becomes a serious one, and could even reach the point where it becomes incurable. That would bring incalculable harm to society and to your family.
