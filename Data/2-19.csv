Whether this and previous cases are linked is speculation at this point, but Hakodate (as well as many other smaller cities in Hokkaido) also receives direct flights from China.     The main trunk road/railway is from Sapporo to New Chitose/Tomakomai, through Noboribetsu, Muroran, Yakumo and all the way down to Hakodate.

Downvote anyone who says WHO is a regulatory agency supposed to work alongside experts in a country ....not over take or make demands or do anything you are suggesting they should be doing.

This isn’t really about Tedros being “Pro China” it is about the US being “Anti China” if you are honest with yourselves.To discredit all the efforts they are going through right now over there is almost criminal.The WHO is in China and has been for a couple of weeks.    They are working alongside the experts in China and now international efforts in the hopes of containment.  Just because Tedros isn’t whipping on China for whatever reasons everything thinks China has failed, doesn’t make him complicit in anything that might be revealed China has or has not done when the dust clears.

I won’t say those aren’t for corpse, but I can say that along with crematoriums, their garbage system is also likely overloaded because of biohazard material. Just think about the amount of gloves required for one patient, or bed pads, or bedsheets that are damaged. All that stuff can’t be thrown out into regular garbage because of contagion. It’s just not realistic to think their current system is good enough to handle that much waste. I used to work in waste disposal and hospitals create a shit load of waste even during regular operation, and a shit load of waste is biohazard waste requiring incinerators.Edit to add: I remember vaguely that one bed created about 30 pounds of waste per day. Their stadium hospital is 10000 beds. So only that stadium produces like 150 Tons of waste per day. Of course it’s not perfect numbers but those 40 incinerators will cover that only.Second edit : Burning plastic produces SO2. Fossil fuel is organic. SO2 is produced by organic matters burning.

A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.Item 1:Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: “I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”Item 2:Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 FromFirst Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 35 year old malehttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and “remains isolated at home.”) see;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-02-04/first-us-coronavirus-patient-released-from-hospital%3fcontext=amp(Please also see these relevant links contributed by r/u/Two_Luffas: The JAMA related to the first story: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044Here's the Lancet case study from Jan. 24 : https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltextThe NEJM case study, but includes all of the relevant supporting documents: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191Another Lancet case study: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930211-7/fulltextLancet case study from Nepal: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30067-0/fulltext)",Help me sort through the bullshit.

fi388dg,-0.9353,-0.2732,"For the science of what happens when you get the virus:“In the early days of an infection, the novel coronavirus rapidly invades human lung cells. Those lung cells come in two classes: ones that make mucus and ones with hair-like batons called cilia.Mucus, though gross when outside the body, helps protect lung tissue from pathogens and make sure your breathing organ doesn’t dry out. The cilia cells beat around the mucus, clearing out debris like pollen or viruses.Frieman explains that SARS loved to infect and kill cilia cells, which then sloughed off and filled patients’ airways with debris and fluids, and he hypothesizes that the same is happening with the novel coronavirus. That’s because the earliest studies on COVID-19 have shown that many patients develop pneumonia in both lungs, accompanied by symptoms like shortness of breath.That’s when phase two and the immune system kicks in. Aroused by the presence of a viral invader, our bodies step up to fight the disease by flooding the lungs with immune cells to clear away the damage and repair the lung tissue.When working properly, this inflammatory process is tightly regulated and confined only to infected areas. But sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way, including your healthy tissue.“So you get more damage instead of less from the immune response,” Frieman says. Even more debris clogs up the lungs, and pneumonia worsens. (Find out how the novel coronavirus compares to flu, Ebola, and other major outbreaks).Lungs 101During the third phase, lung damage continues to build—which can result in respiratory failure. Even if death doesn’t occur, some patients survive with permanent lung damage. According to the WHO, SARS punched holes in the lungs, giving them “a honeycomb-like appearance”—and these lesions are present in those afflicted by novel coronavirus, too.These holes are likely created by the immune system’s hyperactive response, which creates scars that both protect and stiffen the lungs.When that occurs, patients often have to be put on ventilators to assist their breathing. Meanwhile, inflammation also makes the membranes between the air sacs and blood vessels more permeable, which can fill the lungs with fluid and affect their ability to oxygenate blood.“In severe cases, you basically flood your lungs and you can’t breathe,” Frieman says. “That’s how people are dying.”https://www.google.com/amp/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body",Help me sort through the bullshit.

Irreversible lung damageA minority of patients who were infected with SARS (The original one, not SARS-CoV-2 AKA 2019-nCoV) had long-term effects, including and not limited to chronic lung disease. I don't know of any studies on the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 on recovered patients, which is to be expected since the virus has only been around for a few months so far.https://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/> A small percentage of [SARS] patients had long-term effects from their illness, including depression or anxiety, cough, shortness of breath, chronic lung disease or kidney disease. However, most patients fully recovered.---2\. Staying hidden and recurring laterYou may be thinking of the studies which suggest that COVID-19 patients continue to shed the virus for some time after symptoms subside. However, this is not the same as a patient recovering and then later testing negative for the virus. A negative test result implies that the virus is no longer present.https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001468> The detection of 2019-nCoV and a high sputum viral load in a convalescent patient (Patient 1) arouse concern about prolonged shedding of 2019-nCoV after recovery.There has been research regarding **other** coronaviruses - not SARS-CoV-2 in particular - suggesting that in some cases, patients may become re-infected with a same coronavirus and experience worse symptoms than with the previous infection. But this is not the same thing as the virus staying hidden in one's system and then re-emerging later on, and this should definitely not be taken as a guarantee that this will occur with SARS-CoV-2 infections.https://www.docdroid.net/uVOql5p/jvi02015-19full.pdf> ADE has been observed for coronaviruses. Several studies have shown that sera induced by SARS-CoV spike enhance viral entry into Fc-receptor-expressing cells (42-44). Further, one study demonstrated that unlike receptor-dependent viral entry, sera-dependent SARS-CoV entry does not go through the endosome pathway (44). Additionally, it has long been known that immunization of cats with feline coronavirus spike leads to worsened future infection due to the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies (45-47). ---3\. More deadly to smokersOne study has shown that smokers may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. No significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression were found between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (&gt;60 vs &lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to non-smoker samples. This indicates the smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and thus smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/30/lungs-damaged-by-smoking-can-magically-heal-study“Smokers can turn back time in their lungs by kicking the habit, with healthy cells emerging to replace some of their tobacco-damaged and cancer-prone ones, a study shows.Smokers have long been told their risk of developing diseases like lung cancer will fall if they can quit, and stopping smoking prevents new damage to the body.A study published on Thursday in the journal Nature found that the benefits may go further, with the body appearing to draw on a reservoir of healthy cells to replace smoke-damaged ones in the lungs of smokers when they quit.”",Help me sort through the bullshit.

fi3ausf,-0.9947,-0.6705,"Cruise ship is a coronavirus factory, warns expertJapan’s incompetent quarantining of thousands of passengers on a British cruise ship created a “coronavirus machine” that risks further spreading the disease, one of the country’s leading experts has said.Kentaro Iwata, a professor of infectious disease, condemned the decision to release most of the passengers following two weeks of quarantine today because of the danger that infected people who are showing no symptoms of the disease will return to families and jobs unaware that they are passing on the contagion.About 500 of the 3,100 people on board the Diamond Princess are being allowed off today, 14 days after it was quarantined. Professor Iwata says that a failure to follow basic infection control rules, and the unreliability of test results, mean that many of those released from quarantine could be carrying the disease.Today the number of confirmed cases rose to 542. Dr Iwata appealed to the international community to put pressure on the government of Shinzo Abe to prevent further spread of the contagion, officially known as Covid-19. “I’m very concerned because you have no idea whether they have got the infection,” said Dr Iwata, a professor of infectious disease at Kobe University Hospital. “I wish all the international bodies [to] request Japan to change because otherwise there will be more infections.”In an online video, headlined “The Diamond Princess is a Covid-19 manufacturing machine”, Professor Iwata described his horror on finding, during a visit to the ship yesterday, that officials in charge were failing to take the most basic precautions to prevent infection. He said that the situation in the port of Yokohama, one of Japan’s biggest cities, was “completely chaotic” and far worse than scenes he witnessed as a doctor working in parts of Africa stricken with the Ebola virus. After he urged the bureaucrats to improve the situation he was forced to leave the ship.He said that there was no separation of “red” zones, which could be infected with the virus, from “green” areas, which are known to be safe. He observed a doctor treating people with fever who was talking no measures to prevent herself from infection. He saw people eating while wearing protective gloves, which could have been carrying the virus. Those in charge were bureaucrats without medical expertise, and there were no professional infection control experts on the ship.“The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control,” he said. “It was completely chaotic. I’ve dealt with lots of infections [over] more than 20 years. I never had a fear of getting infected myself – Ebola, Sars, cholera. In the Diamond Princess I was so scared of getting infected with Covid-19 because there was no way to tell where the virus was.” Dr Iwata will isolate himself from family and colleagues for two weeks. He said that there was a risk that doctors and nurses working on the ship would return to their hospitals and clinics and infect their patients. “I can’t bear it,” he said.The Japanese health and welfare ministry has defended its decision to quarantine the ship and insists that most of the infections among passengers occurred before the period of isolation began. Japan’s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said: “The National Institute of Infectious Diseases has indicated they can use public transportation as long as they were monitored for 14 days, tested negative to the virus and were confirmed to be in good health.”But the new testimony appears to explain one of the mysteries of the ship – the infection of at least three quarantine officers or medical workers. The ministry says that they wore masks and sterilised their hands during and after interaction with patients. Dr Iwata’s description suggests that there were in fact many flaws in hygiene procedures which could have enabled infection.The reaction of foreign governments suggests that they too lack confidence in Japan’s quarantine regime. The United States, Britain and Australia insist that citizens coming off the ship must either return on official evacuation flights and spend a further 14 days in quarantine or delay their return home until it is clear that they have not contracted the virus",Diamond Princess: Professor Iwata described his horror on finding that officials in charge were failing to take the most basic precautions to prevent infection.,2020-02-19 02:52:07,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f698px/diamond_princess_professor_iwata_described_his/

fi3jph8,-0.8481,0.0772,">That would mean people with lighter cases of infection remain in the community, undetected.  I also 100% agree to your supposition above. The current priority of conducting PCR test in Japan seems to be:  * The close contacts of the previous confirmed (today's 2nd/ this 1st confirmed in Tokyo)  * Those who has pneumonia (Added to the criteria since Feb. 12/13, example: possibly today's 1st in Tokyo, not mentioned in OP, or end confirmed in Okinawa, found today) * Those who suffered fever (more than 37.5 Celsius degree) in relatively longer (4 days)  period (Added to the criteria relatively recently since the beginning of this week, perhaps this 2nd and 3rd confirmed)  It seems to be difficult to distinguish COVID-19 from other common cold especially in its early phase and some are even asymptomatic, as it the case of the male adolescent in Wakayama yesterday (detected by PCR test conducted due to his 'close contact' relationship to his confirmed parents), so I suppose the majority of the cases can even be neglected (undetected by doctors). It's still a season of common cold and flu, and many Japanese (including myself) also has hay fever allergy during February and March.","NEW: Tokyo reports 3 new cases of coronavirus, taking number of new cases in Japan so far today to 9, plus 79 on the cruise ship",2020-02-19 03:49:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f69t71/new_tokyo_reports_3_new_cases_of_coronavirus/

fi4d1qh,-0.2087,-0.4561,I was part of this 5400 and keep in mind this is not a mandatory quarantine. I was the first group to get hit by this restriction as I came back from China and landed at SFO at 3:00 PM and the new policy went into effect at 2:00 PM on 2/2. Basically all this is is them giving you a CDC hand out and saying you should stay at home and contact your doctors with a card they give you if you show symptoms. By no means is this a mandatory thing and there is basically nothing stopping anyone from not quarantining them selves. My 14 days ended on Monday and I actually had to leave the house about 3 times during that 14 day period to pick up some supplies and food. I was being careful and always wore a mask when leaving the house but by no means were there any suggestions by CDC or the government to take any of these precautions. So yea that 5400 is basically any US citizens or permanent residents who came back from China from the 2nd till now and was given a info card.EDIT: also some more info on the so called quarantine. My wife and son came back with me and on the 3rd I called my son’s school to get him excused from school and they actually told me to send him in on that day. I refused and told them to call the district office and it wasn’t until the afternoon that they called to confirm that it was ok to get him excused for 2 weeks.

fi3wco0,-0.4879,-0.2023,"Thanks. There are a couple of things that might round out people understanding of the effort. First is [the 50¢ Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party), the Chinese (usually) government employees who are paid to cruise social media and post the party line. These guys don't usually argue points. The extended exchanges seem to come from a Second younger group of students abroad and expats. These voices are reflective of China's long term educational indoctrination themes; China was oppressed by the world and now China has risen, the Chinese state equals the Chinese people, defend China from the foreigners. These seem to be the angry voices on reddit. They circulate lists of talking points. These are the ones who organize counterprotests about Hong Kong. The third group is older, less vociferous but still mostly a product of the Chinese educational system. I think of it as driven by forwards from grandma Mao only using We Chat instead of facebook. They might recognize the wrongness of what's happening in the camps of Xinjiang but if pressed they'll recount the narrative they've seen on social media offering an explanation. It's still a product of an inability to reflexively distinguish between the Chinese people and the CCP. These folks are mostly well meaning but they continue to push the narratives they see on Chinese social media and hear from their relatives back home. This isn't a uniform defense mind you. Many will admit, for example, that the government probably isn't being honest in how it's reporting COVID19. In other words, this is what you'd likely hear in candid conversations in China. They don't see an issue with inviting a representative from the embassy to a new years celebration and listing to a speech that includes obligatory praise for President Xi (if the speech is translated, often such parts are omitted for the English speaking audience). These are also the people Beijing seeks to co-opt regarding ""helping China"" via illicit tech transfer, information collection, patent infringement, etc. Those that cooperate may be utterly skeptical of the CCP leaders but they don't see helping ""China"" as referring primarily to them.",Quelling a Coronavirus: How Chinese Censors Have Reached an International Audience,2020-02-19 06:47:44,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6bnif/quelling_a_coronavirus_how_chinese_censors_have/

Another woman was asked to put on mask, says she has rights, she is Chinese, she didn't need to put on mask, she wasn't kissing people so why should she do it?A woman didn't use mask on a rail when told she should, she was screaming and spitting at people. An old woman on bus refused to put on mask even when offered, and when told by police that she has to put it on [she was offered mask] or she has to get off and get refunded, she refused. People around her end up getting off the bus [according to voice over]. A father let his son cough over people in rail.etc etc etc. So without context, it's hard to tell what these people were doing BEFORE they were brutally arrested. At some point though, some of them probably did something to deserve arrest. If you say wtf are you you aren't a thing to the police, you are going to get in trouble with the police anywhere.

fi696bl,0.6181,-0.2505,"Keep in mind the vast majority of chinese people are truly very primitive. More than half of the population grew up in what is essentially midevil conditions and now they are being expected to modernize. We are talking about a country where more than half of the population does not even understand the concept of soap (this isn't a stereotype, it's a well known and well studied, established fact). These are people who think rhino tusks are viagra and bear bile will cure everything. Most Chinese people do not understand what a ""virus"" is, and now they are being told if they don't wear a mask they might die from a sickness caused by something they did not even know could exist.   Then add to that the level of narcissism and entitlement chinese women display - and if you haven't noticed, most of these videos are of women getting arrested. Due to their privileged status, due to the population imbalance, in many ways Chinese women get away with everything. They think the rules do not apply to them, because they are a woman. Even moreso, if she's a woman ""with responsibilities"".  It's the ""rich dumb blonde"" syndrome we see in america, but extends all the way down to the poorest women - because even the poorest and most unattractive women are nearly guaranteed to ""marry up"".   I don't hate Chinese people. I just understand them. And while i dislike their government for their actions and influence on other countries (and I would consider HK, taiwan, and tibet as deserving of independence) - I completely understand why the government is the way it is, and I wouldn't ever expect it to be any different. Most of their population is just too primitive to understand anything except force. They are obedient, but they run on autopilot and ""telling"" or ""asking"" or ""showing"" alot of chinese people to change their ways isn't going to turn off that autopilot. They literally need to be beaten into it - but they have an innate respect for authority once they experience physical dominance. I had that experience in china myself. I was standing in line and some dicks just cut in front of me like the line wasn't already long. I asked them to move to the back, some others asked them too, and they just stood there laughing. So i yanked them by their ears like an old school teacher would, physically dragged them to the back, and kicked their knees out so they would squat down. After that, they expressed profound levels of respect for me, as did everyone else in that line. We all got our shit and they got really, really friendly with me, in a sort of ""i wonder if this guy has work for us"" sort of way.","This is why citizens of the PRC have bought masks all over the world and shipped them back to the mainland.

fi3sc3s,-0.5709,0.0,">Results We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate.",Preprint: modeling for future of coronavirus in the U.K. Note: not yet peer reviewed.,2020-02-19 07:31:02,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6c9qz/preprint_modeling_for_future_of_coronavirus_in/

fi51don,0.976,0.0,"As a country?  I think so.  Japan is moving in that direction.  Even excluding the Diamond Princess, we are seeing a steady increase of 10% of cases each day.The Diamond Princess cases are being treated or 'contained' in Japanese facilities, plus the Diamond Princess just released 500 individuals, many of whom will not be allowed into their home countries (ironically).  With more to come.The government response has been mixed.  Abe and Health Minister Kato seem to take it pretty seriously, but a panel of convened ""experts"" basically thought it was not a big deal because they could track the path history of a ""majority"" of cases.  (A decision that will probably cost many lives.)Given the long incubation period, we can expect a minimum of 4 more weeks of exponential growth in Japan.  1-2 weeks for people to take it seriously, then 2-3 weeks of lagged cases (incubations).  With a doubling rate of 7 days (optimistic), that would put us at about 1600 total cases by mid March.   Just two more weeks of exponential growth would give us approximately 1000 cases per day by late March.But honestly the high reliance on very crowded public transport would likely cause the doubling time and infection rate to be much higher.  I expect it will be more like a doubling time of 3-5 days once things get going.  That would mean even the minimum of 4 weeks of exponential growth will result in 1000 cases per day.However, I'm not sure if any individual city in Japan will match Wuhan's official numbers.  Tokyo is the most likely given the Diamond Princess, tourists, crowded metro.  It depends on how quickly the government acts.  Overall I think there's about a 60% chance Tokyo will end up worse than Wuhan's official numbers, but still probably better than Wuhan's ""real"" numbers.",Coronavirus update (Feb 19) in numbers compared to yesterday (day to day delta),2020-02-19 07:47:30,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6cims/coronavirus_update_feb_19_in_numbers_compared_to/

fi4rssb,0.8303,0.1531,"So far the only explanations, in no particular order, that I have identified are:1) Our net is too narrow and our criteria for qualifying for testing too limiting.  At least in BC the official requirement is that you've been to Wuhan or recent contact with someone who has been to Wuhan.  If you're been to the rest of China, you might get tested if it's pretty clear you're suffering materially.  After that it gets a lot greyer.  I have a feeling a desire to protect feelings and avoid worrying the public are the most likely cause.  Our screening criteria significantly lag the US and UK and are not even nationally consistent at this point, which is truly disappointing.2) A recent Chinese academic paper (don't have link handy) seemed to be leaning towards the theory that the higher number of ACE2 receptors in Asians (males in particular) made them more susceptible to this particular virus.  Take all this with a grain of salt, it isn't peer reviewed and it is the only time I've seen this in a formal setting.  Others have suggested the high incidence of smoking among Chinese males may also increase susceptibility in the population, also un-proven to date.  A counter argument to the first idea is that you would still expect to see more frequent incidences among Asian north Americans if that were the case.  The second idea is definitely more China applicable as smoking has declined materially in North America over the past twenty years.3) I was reading an article in a Cambodian newspaper (https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50688880/polluted-air-could-be-an-important-cause-of-wuhan-pneumonia) a few minutes ago that was theorizing (and the article lacks a named author on the by-line so again, grain of salt) that high levels of air pollution in Wuhan in particular may have made people much more susceptible.  This is appears to be speculation although the article goes in to some detail.  This could present an intriguing line of investigation for why we may not be seeing this in a city like Vancouver.  While we have a large Asian population and numerous daily and weekly travel links to China and the broader Asian market, we also enjoy relatively clean air and the benefit of being sea-side.  If this turned out to have any validity it would definitely reshape the climate and pollution discussion globally.  But it would also suggest that countries like India that have low air quality should be reporting large numbers and they are extremely low still.4) General conditions in North America, from amount of ""personal space"" in work and living environments, as well as use of public spaces and other factors as yet to be identified may prove less hospitable to the virus.  I'm highly suspicious that this is the case, but in the absence of better ideas or until disproven will throw it out for discussion.  Temperature does not appear to be a factor as it is winter in Wuhan and 30C+ in Singapore.","2 positive cases, 1 case resolved, 17 cases under investigation and 436 negative cases in Ontario, Canada",2020-02-19 10:05:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6em7b/2_positive_cases_1_case_resolved_17_cases_under/

I did read that all flights from China “For all arrivals from China -- both Korean and foreigners alike -- rigorous quarantine and inspection procedures were required before they could enter.”But when I Read article I don’t think it means a real quarantine or self isolation order.

One of the things that I remember, when visiting Taiwan many years ago was the amount of smog in the air. In fact I was there during typhoon season and experienced the after effects of a typhoon passing by, which completely cleared it away. What a beautiful land Taiwan is, it was a pity I only got to see it and the mountains for a few days until the smog settled in again.  Anyway, I was there for a couple of months and found that I was developing a bad dry cough, my lungs couldn't cope with the air quality. I believe cities in China also have a server issues with air quality and I had my suspicions that mortality rates will likely reflect air pollution rates. That is not to say that individuals will not get the virus but rather healthy lungs are far more better equipped to cope with a viral infection. As this virus is closely related to SARS, I decided to do a quick search last night and see if there was any correlation with severity of the illness and air pollution and came across a number of articles form reputable sources, stating that it may be the case, one from science daily: [SARS Death Rate Doubles in polluted cities](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/11/031120073707.htm).",Smokers may be more susceptable.

fk6w9jw,0.9775,-0.3566,"They claim that ace2 (the receptor for some coronaviruses, including Covid-19 /sars-cov-2) is increased in smokers lungs and therefore smokers are more susceptible. But their data is quite weak and they make some big assumptions. Important to note that this paper hasn't actually been published anywhere and is only a pre print that hadn't undergone peer review. While this is somewhat common during pandemics/outbreaks, things should definitely be taken with a massive grain of salt. This is important cause the paper is a load of shit Imo. Genes get expressed into proteins (such as ace2) through an intermediate form of the gene called. mRNA. The authors simply examined  other people's datasets that looked at the mRNA from biopsies of cancerous lungs. The fact theyre looking at cancerous lungs is already an issue as you can't really compare it to healthy populations. They're also looking at RNA from bulk lung tissue, and can't differentiate between which cell types are expressing ace2 (just because a cell expresses ace2 doesn't mean that particular type is permissive to CoV replication so it's important to understand which cell types are actually upregulating ace2) . Also, mRNA means fuck all as it doesn't prove ace2 protein successfully gets expressed (from the rna), folded correctly, is functional and makes it to the cell surface. It's definitely valuable data and is used in many many studies but inferences can't be properly made unless there's is functional data to back it up. Even then, after all this, the data looks barely significant (in the one of 4 data sets they showed). To me, it looks like they had to play with the stats until they got a significant p value. It's also fishy that their most significant dataset isn't shown in their smoking graph and is just calculated into a table....While it's common for papers to be uploaded as preprints before being accepted by a real journal, it should be under much higher scrutiny and skepticism",Smokers may be more susceptable.

fi4mmdg,-0.7965,-0.25,"Full article:By Brianna AbbottFeb. 19, 2020 5:30 am ETPRINTTEXT6Public-health officials in the U.S. are striving to keep tabs on thousands of Americans who have quarantined themselves at home after returning from mainland China to curtail the new coronavirus, adding to an epidemic response that is straining already-stretched local departments.More than 5,400 people had been asked to self-quarantine in California alone as of Feb. 14, according to the California Department of Public Health. Hundreds more are self-quarantining in Georgia, Washington state, Illinois, New York and other states.Public-health officials are following directions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to supervise these people, but many steps are being developed on the fly. States are using a variety of techniques to track people from calling in volunteers to make phone calls, to sending text messages and using electronic registries.Coronavirus Outbreak Tests New Vaccine Development StrategyYOU MAY ALSO LIKEUP NEXT 0:00 / 4:18Coronavirus Outbreak Tests New Vaccine Development StrategyCoronavirus Outbreak Tests New Vaccine Development StrategyScientists racing to find a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus are hoping a cutting-edge approach called “rapid response platforms” will quickly yield a breakthrough. WSJ’s Jason Bellini explains what these are and how they work. Photo: NIAIDThese people are separate from the Americans who are under stricter federal quarantine, including those housed at four U.S. air bases and the 328 who were recently evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those groups arrived from locations where the virus was rapidly spreading, whereas the people self-monitoring at home are thought to be at lower risk of having been exposed to it.Cumulative outcome for people tested forthe coronavirus in the U.S.Source: Centers for Disease Control and PreventionNote: Since January 21, 2020PositiveNegativePendingJan. 27Feb. 3Feb. 10Feb. 170100200300400500So far, there have been 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S., not including the potentially positive cases among those evacuated from the Diamond Princess. While health officials have investigated 467 people for the virus as of Monday, 392 tested negative, with 60 cases pending, according to the CDC. The immediate risk to the general public is still low, health officials say.While public-health authorities are experienced with isolating, contact tracing and quarantining people to contain infectious diseases such as measles and tuberculosis, an attempt to monitor and quarantine people at this scale is a unique challenge. And quarantines typically apply only to those with a known exposure to a virus, rather than just travel history, public-health officials say.“That’s a whole new scope of work,” Sara Cody, director of the public-health department in Santa Clara County, the home of Silicon Valley, which has had two confirmed cases of Covid-19. Both patients had returned from Wuhan, China, where the epidemic began.TRACKING THE CORONAVIRUS•Chinese officials celebrated a drop in the number of new coronavirus infections and deaths.•China’s State Council called on “low-risk regions” around the country to resume full production.•The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that the most of confirmed cases were mild.•The head of Wuhan’s Wuchang Hospital died of the coronavirus.Tracking the CoronavirusVIEW IN DEPTHA coalition of staffers, employees from other departments, health-care providers and federal officials engaged in a classic outbreak response to monitor people, such as family and health-care workers, who came in close contact with two local cases. And now, the department has added tracking recent arrivals from China to their to-do list. “We’re still in the middle of figuring out these operations,” Dr. Cody said.Travel from mainland China to the U.S. has been sharply curtailed since many airlines suspended flights and the U.S. barred entry to most foreign nationals arriving from China. Still, some Americans continue to arrive into 11 airports designated by federal officials, and health authorities are on the lookout for passengers who are coming from other countries but were also recently in China.Los Angeles County, for instance, is adding dozens of returning travelers to its monitoring list daily, said Barbara Ferrer, the director for the L.A. County Department of Public Health.Those without symptoms who haven’t been to Hubei province, which includes Wuhan, are allowed to go on to their final destinations, but are asked to stay at home for up to 14 days, monitor their health, check in with their local health departments and contact their health-care providers if they develop symptoms, such as a fever or dry cough.They are asked to avoid close contact with others, typically defined as being within 6 feet of another person for a prolonged period. Sometimes those who are self-quarantining are told they may go outside and exercise if no one is nearby, or grocery shop. The orders aren’t binding, but local health officials can issue stricter quarantine orders if necessary. So far, most people are cooperative, local health officials say.U.S. passengers evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan disembark from a flight in Texas.PHOTO: WILLIAM LUTHER/ASSOCIATED PRESSState and local health officials say they get information on people who are self-quarantining from federal officials who screen them at airports. But sometimes local officials receive incorrect or illegible phone numbers for some, or just missing data for others, and have to circle back to federal authorities for more information to track down the person.Seattle and King County in Washington state, which have roughly 400 people self-monitoring at home, have recruited volunteers from the University of Washington School of Public Health and the department’s Public Health Reserve Corps, said Jeffrey Duchin, the health officer at Public Health—Seattle and King County. The county is spending roughly $200,000 a week on the response, which also requires redirecting staff from other tasks.HEALTH NEWS IN YOUR INBOXGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry.

Seattle and King County offer a dietitian-reviewed menu and deliver bagels, turkey lunch meat, avocado salsa, fruit and hair conditioner, among other items, to a person under investigation waiting for test results.“The amount of manpower, both resources and time, has been tremendous, and so what that means is that our existing staff are working two jobs around the clock for several weeks,” said Dr. Duchin. “It’s been like one big, long bad day.”A quarantine site in North Bend, Wash., for travelers who have been exposed to coronavirus in China.PHOTO: JASON REDMOND/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGESIn Chicago, the health department is surveying people daily with an electronic registry, which is part of its monitoring practice for other infectious diseases, and is in contact with them more directly as needed. Other health departments phone or email initially, then sometimes follow up in a few days or a week.On Monday, the Washington State Department of Health started using a text-messaging system developed by the CDC. The state will send a daily text to new arrivals and will refer anyone who reports fever or other symptoms to their local health departments. Washington says it is the first state to use the system. The CDC has made the tool available to any interested health departments and is using it to check in on some of its own staff on the ground responding to the epidemic in the U.S., said Anita Patel, the lead of pandemic medical care and countermeasures at the CDC.SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSAre you confident in U.S. authorities to be able to contain the coronavirus from spreading? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.Public-health authorities say they are also working to fight xenophobia and misinformation around the virus. The Chicago Department of Public Health held a press conference in Chinatown last week to announce that all of the close contacts of their two Covid-19 cases had passed the incubation period and had been cleared—and then the team had lunch with local business leaders in Chinatown.The effort is straining state and local budgets. States and some larger local departments receive support from the CDC’s Public Health Emergency Preparedness funds, though the money is meant for preparing for an outbreak and doesn’t often cover full responses, they say.“We’ve been keeping close track of those costs and expenditures with the assumption that there would be additional funding available in time,” said Allison Arwady, the commissioner at the Chicago Department of Public Health. “We’re paying our bills right now, but we absolutely need additional funding to be able to maintain the level of response this is going to require.”Many health departments say they are in a good spot for now, as close contacts to the early confirmed cases are passing the incubation period without new infections popping up. But based on the continuing spread of the coronavirus, some health officials expect to be on high alert for the long-term, saying this type of aggressive response might not be sustainable. Strategies might also need to shift if the virus gets a foothold in the U.S.“I just look around, and there are a lot of people here because they’re just committed to the mission, but they’re getting tired,” said Dr. Cody. “This is what they believe in, and that takes us a long way, but it won’t take us for months and months and months.”","“More than 5,400 people had been asked to self-quarantine in California alone as of Feb. 14, according to the California Department of Public Health.

fi57sir,0.2057,-0.25,"Gonna be honest... a 14 day self imposed quarantine could be absolutely brutal depending on your living/ financial situation. There are so many hurdles... the biggest being work/school obligations obviously.Physically/mentally...try going that long without going outside at all (esp for people without enclosed yard areas). People with small apartments aren’t able to get any real exercise. Lots of people don’t even have good natural lighting in their homes. Cabin fever is a real thing. Even prisoners get an hour of outdoor rec time. Imagine if you’re a parent with young kids who now has to find someone to take care of them.You have to figure out how to stock up on food and water without human contact. All of that takes time and money, which a lot of Americans can’t afford. And it’d be a test of mental fortitude a lot of people can’t stand.  It’s made even more difficult by the fact that these people haven’t been confirmed to have the virus. So basically, self imprisonment based on something invisible you likely do not even have at all. I don’t blame people for breaking under that sort of stress/pressure.

Testing with a second protocol consisting of two commercial sets (LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene, and LightMix Modular Wuhan CoV RdRP-gene, both produced by TIB MOLBIOL) and retesting of the positive samples at the Institute of Virology, Philipps University Marburg, in Marburg, Germany, confirmed the results. In addition, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from both samples in cell culture of Caco-2 cells indicated potential infectivity (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).>These two persons were subsequently isolated from the cohort and transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit at University Hospital Frankfurt for further evaluation and observation on the following day.

fi5oipt,-0.6828,0.6486,"Quite a lot of differences between wildlife trade (as in the bushmeat trade) and hunting as it's done in the US:a) Typically sale of game meat is illegal (venison you typically see in a store or restaurant is in fact farm-raised), although some states do have programs where game meat can be *donated* to impoverished people and soup kitchens via state-run programsb) Typically American hunters are either butchering their own game or are taken to licensed wildlife processors (which are butchers with additional licensing and training whom are required to keep prep facilities for wildlife meats separate from farm-raised animal meats like beef)c) In general, there are actually less species eaten by Americans as wild game (and yes, I'm even accounting for the average Appalachian diet which includes squirrel and opossum as food animals out of occasional necessity^(1), and I'm also accounting for Alaskan Natives and people living ""on the land"" in Alaska where subsistence hunting is still a Thing^(1)).  Outside of a very few ethnic communities, typically the critters we eat aren't HUGE zoonotic risks compared to (say) bats.d) There are actually mandatory inspection programs in most states for game animals that have potential zoonotic risks (things like CWD in deer, ""mad squirrel disease"" in squirrels (yes, there's a prion disease people have gotten from squirrel brains similar to nvCJD), brucellosis in elk and bison, trichinosis in wild hogs and bear, avian flus in waterfowl).e) In general, licensing is required to harvest game (save for animals on your own land, and typically even THOSE require tagging and permitting for certain classes of wild animal).f) In general, it's typically illegal as hell to raise your own game animals for hunting (with a very, very few exceptions like legally being able to raise pheasants or quail for hunting).Bushmeat (as it's done in Chinese ""wet markets"" and sub-Saharan African wet markets that have been linked with disease transmission) has typically involved keeping live and dead animals together, consumption of animals that are zoonotic health risks that we just don't eat Stateside (stuff like flying foxes and certain bats and pangolins and primates)...and especially slaughter in conditions that do not allow for effective disinfection and not using dedicated butchering facilities for wild game versus domesticated animal's meat.^(1) Before the militant vegans and vegetarians start yelling: Both Appalachia and much of Alaska are in major ""food deserts"" where fresh vegetables and meat substitutes are either not available at any price (without hundreds of miles of travel) or are very expensive even compared to other rural parts of the US; in addition, these areas are often *not* suited to the kinds of agriculture required to make a nutritionally complete meal without the use of animal meats (because the growing season is too short in much of Alaska, and because there's a shortage of arable land that can be tilled and is not literally on the side of a flipping *mountain* in the case of Appalachia).

fi4zm31,0.8874,-0.0772," ***In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers.

fi53z24,0.9916,0.3818,"Update to Feb 19, 2020.Please note that this will be my last post in this particular format. The 2-factor polynomial curve isn't a great fit any more, so I will be working on a new format to show the ongoing growth of worldwide numbers.For those who continue to post suggestions about breaking out cruise infections, please note that this is intended to show the progressive growth of cases worldwide. There is no doubt that the cruise numbers have a major impact on the growth. Others have helpfully provided links to graphs that break these numbers out. Eventually the spike will work itself out. The purpose of this graph is to get an overall sense of the disease progress globally. The only reason China's numbers are not included is because there is significant doubt as to the veracity of these numbers, and so the decision was made from the beginning to leave them out. Everything else, including cruise numbers, are included to give us an evolving sense of the global situation.Our world is in this for the long haul, and the more we know, the better we will be able to respond as a planet.Thank you for all the encouraging messages from those who are finding this format helpful!\-------This is an animated gif showing the changing trendline day over day, as compared to the original extrapolation from Feb 1, 2020.Methodology:Original extrapolation is a 2-factor polynomial best fit from Feb 1, 2020 (green line and dots).

fi5aauz,0.7335,0.2023,"A statement from Dr. Takayama, the DMAT team member who recommended Prof Iwata enter the cruise ship.  ""Watching Dr. Iwata's video, well, I thought it was very typical of how he is. I hadn't paid much mind to it, but it's gone pretty viral.  To those who don't know Dr.Iwata, it was probably a little shocking. However, the content of the video could possibly put the disembarking passengers and those working in on the ground in an uncomfortable situation. As someone involved, while admitting the facts, I'd like to correct a few misconceptions and omissions.     - Ejected after 1 day  This is a fact. More accurately, he was in the cruise ship for just under 2 hours. As far as I can tell, he saw the area around the lounge.    - A call from someone working in the Ministry of Labor, Health and Welfare saying ""You can enter"" and ""Let's think about how to do this"".  This was me. However, I never said ""You can enter."" Because I never had the authority. However, I did say ""Let's think about how to do this"". I merely advised him that The Japanese Society for Infection Control and Prevention were already in action, and he might be able to work through them. However, after trying to get approval (and being left waiting for a while), this was rejected.     - Someone from the MLHW proposed entering the ship as a DMAT team member.  This was me. This is correct.    - ""If you work under the DMAT team as a team member (not as an infection control specialist) and do only DMAT work, I can get you on board""  This was me. However, I never said ""I can get you on board"". Because I never had the authority. What I did say was ""If you're going to enter as a member of DMAT, please do full-on DMAT work. Please don't say anything regarding infection control right from the start. Once you've built up trust, you can then advise them about it.""  This was because on the ground, they were in the middle of the operation of getting passengers off the ship and were working with limited staff. During all of that, there was the fear that if Dr. Iwata suddenly began to supervise infection control, all activity might stop. Well, a cruise ship is a special type of environment, so I thought that just having a quick look wouldn't make him start making recommendations.  Of course, I don't deny Dr. Iwata's wealth of experience. However, it was an extraordinary environment where DMAT, JSDF, quarantine officers, etc. a multitude of different organizations were working and overlapping, so I wanted him to prioritize first getting acclimated to that environment.    - ""Understood"", he said and went to the site.  And thus, he gave me his word.    - Talked to the DMAT head doctor, who said ""I don't expect you to do DMAT work, you're not a (DMAT) specialist. Since you do infection control work, you should be doing infection control"", or something to that effect.  This is true. Dr. Iwata took this to mean that he could participate in infection control. However, on the ship, there wasn't just DMAT, but also MLHW, JSDF, and what's more, the cruise ship company including the ship captain - a multitude of decision making processes were involved. He did not understand this complexity, and broke his word to me. At the very least, he could have given me a call, but he ended up given infection control recommendations to every section.  In the end, what happened ...? Confusion started in the site, and as long as he was there, work couldn't get done, so he was removed from the ship. Of course, I believe that his recommendations as an infection control doctor were appropriate. However, doing the right thing alone isn't enough to change organizations. Especially in the middle of disaster control, trust is the most important aspect.    - I was never afraid in Africa or China, but the situation on the Diamond Princess was so horrifying that I was afraid from the bottom of my heart.  This is related to how he felt, so I cannot deny this. Furthermore, the enclosed environment on the ship was an extraordinary one, and there was an emerging disease, there way no way he wouldn't be afraid. But I'd like everyone to know, in the midst of all that, there were people continuing to do their best. On a side note, I'm entering the ship tomorrow too.  There were many issues, which have been resolved by now. There are many more to be resolved. We cannot run away as long as there are passenger. At the very least, until the end of the operation, we cannot disembark the passengers and release them into their home regions, or into the world.  I too believe that for infection control specialists hold that the highest priority is to protect yourself, but people working on the ship for 2 weeks supporting the passengers are putting the safety of Japan and the world first.  With the way things has come to this, I don't mind criticism of the government. I would have preferred to avoid paralyzing the worksite with fear, without an adequate conclusion. Because they can't run away.    - On the Diamond Princess, the Green and Red Zones were jumbled, and it was impossible to tell where was dangerous or safe.  I can understand his statement, as he is an infection control specialist. However, this creates a misunderstanding that zoning was not performed. In fact zoning was performed. Even though it was imperfect.  It is true that in a hospital in a developed country, or a medical centre set up by NGOs or international organizations in developing countries, more sophisticated infection controls would have been performed. However, this mission was extremely complicated - the sudden appearance of 3700 crew and passengers on a cruise ship with an emerging disease.  I too have participated in NGO activities abroad, and even now am the director of an international NGO, however, no matter what NGO or international organization, it's unavoidable that things start out chaotic. I can't say that there weren't any regrettable things about this 2 weeks, I think that people on the site have done their absolute best. People will probably laugh at my idealism.    - I was walking with a quarantine officer and passed a patient on the ship  This absolutely cannot be true. Paths of movement were restricted. It wasn't a patient, but probably a passenger. Even among them, this would have been rare.    - As I said before, he showed extreme displeasure and would not listen to a word  An infection control specialist is required to have the abilities of a consultant. This includes getting people to listen to you. When people don't listen to what I have to say, I don't blame them. The way I explained was probably wrong.    - If I'm not there, now there will be no infection control professional there.  This is wrong. Every day, an infection control/public health specialist doctor boards and supervises. I think he didn't know this. Well, if one says that such a person wouldn't be a professional compared to him, I can't deny that.    - It was even worse than Sierra Leone  He was probably referring to a medical centre run by a developed country in Sierra Leone. I hope he does not confuse that with the horrifying infection control of a community hospital in the world's poorest country.    - Regarding the epidemic curve, I was told today that such data is not being collected at all.  This is wrong. This is not Dr.Iwata's fault. The person who told him that just didn't know.    That's all. I have said what I felt. If there's a difference in opinions, I too might have been mistaken. Please let me know about it. Anyhow, I am not doubting Dr. Iwata's intentions. The lesson learned from the handling of the cruise ship situation should be inspected and utilized.  In the first place, this was the first time that something like this had been done. Of course there were going to be mistakes. If there were any coverups, it would be a betrayal of the passengers, the crew who didn't abandon them, the JSDF members and the medical personnel who assembled from all over the country.  But, right now, our country is at critical point, facing an emerging disease and not knowing whether it can be contained or will spread to every part of the country. Unfortunately, until they are faced with actual danger, Japanese people are prone to averting their eyes, focusing on criticizing someone, and become absorbed in assigning blame. I think that such times of anxiety and doubt are when we have to unite.",Response from the DMAT team member who recommended Prof. Iwata enter the cruise ship,2020-02-19 16:27:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6kcy3/response_from_the_dmat_team_member_who/

fi5sga7,0.2598,0.2023,"That's the most telling issue. If you can't maintain a high level of security/procedure between those two it's essentially worthless. Procedure violations are the largest causes of laboratory incidents, followed by ventilation issues. I worked on the ventilation side of design and construction for laboratories and hospitals and it's the most important aspect in terms of design, outside of procedure. Nearly all other issues can be combatted with procedural practices but if a dirty area is positively pressured compared to the grey or green rooms, it's all but impossible to contain a pathogen that's spread through the air. Creating a barrier between the 'green' area and 'red' areas is usually done with an intermediary space called an anteroom. The green area is positively pressured against the grey (anteroom) and then the grey room is positively pressured against the red, or dirty room. Those entering the red room will don PPE in the green room, enter into the disinfected anteroom and normalize pressure so there's a positive pressure entering the red area (to mitigate airbornes from escaping the dirty area), then proceeded with their tasks. When finished with their tasks they will re-enter the anteroom, confirm air pressure is still pushing towards the dirty side, and then disinfect the external PPE. Then they take *very* careful procedures to remove and dispose of their PPE while still in the anteroom. Then they are allowed to move back to the clean side.I've only been a part of a few projects this complex, but one is enough to know that airborne pathogens are taken very seriously in a laboratory setting, and should be in every setting. Without these precautions it's essentially impossible to keep a clean side 'green' with an airborne pathogen.",Response from the DMAT team member who recommended Prof. Iwata enter the cruise ship,2020-02-19 16:27:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6kcy3/response_from_the_dmat_team_member_who/

fi6j6dh,-0.5187,0.0,"I am riding this out in Shenzhen, as well, and can vouch for most of what the OP says. Shenzhen is truly a test city in China, when it comes to containment. I'd estimate that 40% of the city is still away, which is most of the factory workers and more migrant community.  This is what is causing all of the disruption of supply chain and production, very soon to be a global issue. Expats of means have vacated the city in droves and it is a humble few that remain. All restaurants and bars are now closed to customers and will only do take away orders.  Bright side: This means I can still get pastor tacos with an extra-large margarita to go, but I have to go and eat it alone in my apartment.  Even house helpers are barred from entering an apartment complex, they don't live in.It is boring, but this is Day 2 of no reported cases in the city, which as the OP pointed out, has the highest number outside of Wuhan.  None of these measures would fly in the states, but Shenzhen is also a city that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.
