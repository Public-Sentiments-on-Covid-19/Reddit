Its pretty unlikely even with your recent travel. You also seem to be attempting some level of self quarantine even if not required but I'm sure there have been many asymptomatic infected travelers coming in this weekend that are not subject to any self quarantine just because they bought a ticket before the seemingly arbitrary 5 pm deadline today.It's not just US citizens and immediately family returning home this weekend. Non citizens and Chinese national with unknown exposure left also.5 million people left Wuhan before the quarantine went into effect. Most developed countries and almost all airlines are currently implementing a quarantine of all of China and it will likely get much more drastic as the virus spreads within China. How many of Wuhan's 5 million left China on flights before 5pm EST this weekend to escape a second quarantine? Countries that aren't closing the borders now are going to be the next ones isolated from the rest of the world. The US will quickly close travel from Cambodia,Thailand, Philippines and all the other SE Asain countries that are dependent on the CCP/Chinese tourists and are currently downplaying the virus through government propaganda. Closing travel from China will have major effects on the US, this isn't the case for many other countries.We should have started quarantine/isolation of arrivals from China(US citizen or not) the same day China quarantined 50 million of their own citizens.","My story running around Hainan, cabin fever in Beijing, and now on a flight to the US",2020-02-02 10:10:05,/r/Coronavirus/comments/exsemz/my_story_running_around_hainan_cabin_fever_in/

fgd2ghi,-0.9978,0.3612,"The Wuhan coronavirus spreading from China is now likely to become a pandemic that circles the globe, according to many of the world‚Äôs leading infectious disease experts.The prospect is daunting. A pandemic ‚Äî an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents ‚Äî may well have global consequences, despite the extraordinary travel restrictions and quarantines now imposed by China and other countries, including the United States.Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however, so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause. But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted between humans.The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,‚Äù said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.‚ÄúBut will it be catastrophic? I don‚Äôt know.‚ÄùIn the last three weeks, the number of lab-confirmed cases has soared from about 50 in China to 14,000 in 23 countries; there have been over 300 deaths, all but one in China.Unlock more free articles.Create an account or log inBut various epidemiological models estimate that the real number of cases is 100,000 or even more. While that expansion is not as rapid as that of flu or measles, it is an enormous leap beyond what virologists saw when SARS and MERS emerged.When SARS was vanquished in July 2003 after spreading for nine months, only 8,098 cases had been confirmed. MERS has been circulating since 2012, but there have been only about 2,500 known cases.How Bad Will the Coronavirus Outbreak Get? Here Are 6 Key FactorsHere‚Äôs what early research says about how the pathogen behaves and the factors that will determine whether it can be contained.Jan. 31, 2020The biggest uncertainty now, experts said, is how many people around the world will die. SARS killed about 10 percent of those who got it, and MERS now kills about one of three.The 1918 ‚ÄúSpanish flu‚Äù killed only about 2.5 percent of its victims ‚Äî but because it infected so many people and medical care was much cruder then, 20 to 50 million died.By contrast, the highly transmissible H1N1 ‚Äúswine flu‚Äù pandemic of 2009 killed about 285,000, fewer than seasonal flu normally does, and had a relatively low fatality rate, estimated at .02 percent.The mortality rate for known cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has been running about 2 percent, although that is likely to drop as more tests are done and more mild cases are found.It is ‚Äúincreasingly unlikely that the virus can be contained,‚Äù said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now runs Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit devoted to fighting epidemics.‚ÄúIt is therefore likely that it will spread, as flu and other organisms do, but we still don‚Äôt know how far, wide or deadly it will be.‚ÄùIn the early days of the 2009 flu pandemic, ‚Äúthey were talking about Armageddon in Mexico,‚Äù Dr. Fauci said. (That virus first emerged in pig-farming areas in Mexico‚Äôs Veracruz State.) ‚ÄúBut it turned out to not be that severe.‚ÄùAn accurate estimate of the virus‚Äôs lethality will not be possible until certain kinds of studies can be done: blood tests to see how many people have antibodies, household studies to learn how often it infects family members, and genetic sequencing to determine whether some strains are more dangerous than others.Closing borders to highly infectious pathogens never succeeds completely, experts said, because all frontiers are somewhat porous. Nonetheless, closings and rigorous screening may slow the spread, which will buy time for the development of drug treatments and vaccines.Other important unknowns include who is most at risk, whether coughing or contaminated surfaces are more likely to transmit the virus, how fast the virus can mutate and whether it will fade out when the weather warms.Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the OutbreakThe virus has sickened more than 14,600 people in China and 23 other countries.The effects of a pandemic would probably be harsher in some countries than in others. While the United States and other wealthy countries may be able to detect and quarantine the first carriers, countries with fragile health care systems will not. The virus has already reached Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines and rural Russia.‚ÄúThis looks far more like H1N1‚Äôs spread than SARS, and I am increasingly alarmed,‚Äù said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ‚ÄúEven 1 percent mortality would mean 10,000 deaths in each million people.‚ÄùOther experts were more cautious.Dr. Michael Ryan, head of emergency responses for the World Health Organization, said in an interview with STAT News on Saturday that there was ‚Äúevidence to suggest this virus can still be contained‚Äù and that the world needed to ‚Äúkeep trying.‚ÄùDr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virus-hunter at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who is in China advising its Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that although the virus is clearly being transmitted through casual contact, labs are still behind in processing samples.ImageIn Hyderabad, India, doctors left an isolation ward for people kept under observation after returning from China.In Hyderabad, India, doctors left an isolation ward for people kept under observation after returning from China.Credit...Mahesh Kumar/Associated PressBut life in China has radically changed in the last two weeks. Streets are deserted, public events are canceled, and citizens are wearing masks and washing their hands, Dr. Lipkin said. All of that may have slowed down what lab testing indicated was exponential growth in the infection.It‚Äôs unclear exactly how accurate tests done in overwhelmed Chinese laboratories are. On the one hand, Chinese state media have reported test kit shortages and processing bottlenecks, which could produce an undercount.But Dr. Lipkin said he knew of one lab running 5,000 samples a day, which might produce some false-positive results, inflating the count. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt possibly do quality control at that rate,‚Äù he said.Anecdotal reports from China, and one published study from Germany, indicate that some people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus can pass it on before they show symptoms. That may make border-screening much harder, scientists said.Epidemiological modeling released Friday by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control estimated that 75 percent of infected people reaching Europe from China would still be in the incubation periods upon arrival, and therefore not detected by airport screening, which looks for fevers, coughs and breathing difficulties.But if thermal cameras miss victims who are beyond incubation and actively infecting others, the real number of missed carriers may be higher than 75 percent.Still, asymptomatic carriers ‚Äúare not normally major drivers of epidemics,‚Äù Dr. Fauci said. Most people get ill from someone they know to be sick ‚Äî a family member, a co-worker or a patient, for example.The virus‚Äôs most vulnerable target is Africa, many experts said. More than 1 million expatriate Chinese work there, mostly on mining, drilling or engineering projects. Also, many Africans work and study in China and other countries where the virus has been found.If anyone on the continent has the virus now, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure the diagnostic systems are in place to detect it,‚Äù said Dr. Daniel Bausch, head of scientific programs for the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, who is consulting with the W.H.O. on the outbreak.South Africa and Senegal could probably diagnose it, he said. Nigeria and some other countries have asked the W.H.O. for the genetic materials and training they need to perform diagnostic tests, but that will take time.At least four African countries have suspect cases quarantined, according to an article published Friday in The South China Morning Post. They have sent samples to France, Germany, India and South Africa for testing.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]At the moment, it seems unlikely that the virus will spread widely in countries with vigorous, alert public health systems, said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.‚ÄúEvery doctor in the U.S. has this top of mind,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAny patient with fever or respiratory problems will get two questions. ‚ÄòHave you been to China? Have you had contact with anyone who has?‚Äô If the answer is yes, they‚Äôll be put in isolation right away.‚ÄùAssuming the virus spreads globally, tourism to and trade with countries besides China may be affected ‚Äî and the urgency to find ways to halt the virus and prevent deaths will grow.ImageMen in protective suits greeted a plane carrying 32 Mongolian citizens evacuated from Wuhan, China, as it arrived in Ulaanbaatar.Men in protective suits greeted a plane carrying 32 Mongolian citizens evacuated from Wuhan, China, as it arrived in Ulaanbaatar.Credit...Byambasuren Byamba-Ochir/Agence France-Presse ‚Äî Getty ImagesIt is possible that the Wuhan coronavirus will fade out as weather warms. Many viruses, like flu, measles and norovirus, thrive in cold, dry air. The SARS outbreak began in winter, and MERS transmission also peaks then, though that may be related to transmission in newborn camels.Four mild coronaviruses cause about a quarter of the nation‚Äôs common colds, which also peak in winter.But even if an outbreak fades in June, there could be a second wave in the fall, as has occurred in every major flu pandemic, including those that began in 1918 and 2009.","Wuhan Coronavirus Looks Increasingly Like a Pandemic, Experts Say",2020-02-02 11:54:26,/r/Coronavirus/comments/exu1zc/wuhan_coronavirus_looks_increasingly_like_a/

A common combination is pills containing lopinavir and ritonavir with infusions of interferon, a signaling protein that wakes up the immune system.In the United States, the combination is sold as Kaletra by AbbVie for H.I.V. therapy, and it is relatively expensive. In India, a dozen generic makers produce the drugs at rock-bottom prices for use against H.I.V. in Africa, and their products are W.H.O.-approved.Another option may be an experimental drug, remdesivir, on which the patent is held by Gilead. The drug has not yet been approved for use against any disease. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that it works against coronaviruses, and Gilead has donated doses to China.Several American companies are working on a vaccine, using various combinations of their own funds, taxpayer money and foundation grants.Although modern gene-chemistry techniques have made it possible to build vaccine candidates within just days, medical ethics require that they then be carefully tested on animals and small numbers of healthy humans for safety and effectiveness.That aspect of the process cannot be sped up, because dangerous side effects may take time to appear and because human immune systems need time to produce the antibodies that show whether a vaccine is working.Whether or not what is being tried in China will be acceptable elsewhere will depend on how rigorously Chinese doctors run their clinical trials.‚ÄúIn God we trust,‚Äù Dr. Schaffner said. ‚ÄúAll others must provide data.‚Äù","Wuhan Coronavirus Looks Increasingly Like a Pandemic, Experts Say",2020-02-02 11:54:26,/r/Coronavirus/comments/exu1zc/wuhan_coronavirus_looks_increasingly_like_a/

fgda9xt,0.9905,0.0,"While your bunny CAN get a coronavirus, it cannot get this one (nCoV-2019). Coronaviruses are a family of viruses, and some of those can infect humans, but not all. The kinds that can infect animals like dogs, cats, and yes, bunnies, don't have the right ""keys"" to get into our cells. After all, most locks use keys, but all keys don't work in every lock.  This particular virus has a key that can get into our cells, but not bun's cells. Bunny is safe, and probably better suited to this than humans are.He looks like a cutie, for what it's worth. Take good care of him. What that means now, is, perhaps, stock up on some food for him just in case you can't get to the store for some time. A couple of weeks of non-perishable stuff will do.

If your pet is being touched, someone infected could leave viral particles on it.  If other people pet it, they could transfer the virus to themselves.  If the pet is free to roam the house... you have a virus dispenser wandering around your home and shaking viruses off of itself and all over your furniture, carpet, and family.  That is not CONFIRMED, but it's likely.What is for sure though, even if someone in your house had the virus, if you keep the rabbit in the cage, and nobody touches it until this blows over, there is NO RISK to the your family posed by the rabbit.

fggi0ou,-0.899,-0.8176,"If you do the math on how this can so easily be transmitted while showing no symptoms, this means this is going to quickly blow up in epic proportions on a global scale.  The USA is completely blind to this due to the impeachment trial and upcoming election caucuses.  If you look at the JohnHopkins data sheet it went from roughly 1000 to 15,000 in under a single week.  And I think, based on a lot of research I‚Äôve done over the last 4 days, is inaccurate and very low.  China is so overwhelmed right now with the sick and dying, they can‚Äôt possibly produce anything very accurate but I think that alone, the fact they are so overwhelmed, is very telling.Secondly they just started reporting on this, what, less than 2 weeks ago.  They do however know this virus took off over a month ago back in December.  This tells me that if this virus is as highly contagious as they say it is, then the actual numbers are much, much higher.   What we really need to know is a factual rate of death vs infection.  Thats the main concern.  How deadly is it.  Especially if you cant get any sort of medical care. Lastly,  the USA and all other governments would not have gone to such drastic measures to evacuate people and cut off flights in/out unless they thought this is very serious or potentially serious.  It is after all much better to err on the side of caution.  But at the same time maybe they know a lot more than they will admit to not suddenly scare everyone at the same time and create a mass panic.  I think those two last things are a given in any sort of pandemic situation.  They don‚Äôt yet know how to handle it so they shut down as much transmission as possible. But its already here in the USA and is spreading, likely at a similar rate or slightly lower rate to China.   It could be over 100,000 in USA within 30 days.  I can only hope that if so, we will get much more accurate data about how dangerous it really is.

fgfbydh,0.9954,0.2103,"I'm an infectious disease clinician, and this is the talk I've been reciting all day this week and cut and pasted from a comment I left a couple days ago:This virus travels via droplet transmission, which means being close to infected individuals who are coughing and sneezing, but **most people catch it through fomites (things you touch)**, which is why hand hygiene is your top priority! Staying home is best, but not very practical. If you must be in contact with the public, try to keep a 6ft personal bubble (3ft will likely work, but 6ft is best).  A lot of people have talked about wearing a mask, and with the exception of being in close proximity to someone (within that 3-6ft I mentioned above) the effectiveness of a mask mostly comes from its ability to remind you not to touch your face.  **We humans touch our face an average of 4 times per hour**! So even though everyone reading this is thinking ""no way, not me, I don't do it that often"", yes, you actually do. **However**, most people aren't used to the feeling of a mask on their face and it takes a while to become immune to the itching, sweating, and irritation they can cause, which might make you touch your face even more! Practice wearing them for a few hours here and there without touching or adjusting them while you're safe at home, before the virus is widespread, and before going out in public to see if this method works for you. Make a game out of it where you and everyone else in your home try to catch each other messing with their mask, because others will notice it before you do, especially if there's a win on the line. If you just can't help from unconsciously adjusting your mask or scratching each itch, you're better off without it.   Instead, maybe wear gloves or mittens or whatever else will make you stop when you unconsciously put hands to face. Get creative! Let me know if you think of any other ways to remind yourself not to touch your face! Also, learn how to take gloves off properly. There's actually a specific method to it, you can probably look it up on YouTube, and then practice by covering both gloved hands completely in shaving cream or something of the like (front and back and between fingers) and then take them off without getting a single drop of the shaving cream anywhere (give it a try, it's actually tougher than it sounds!). As far as your eyes go, goggles will fog up on you in approximately 60 seconds and need to be adjusted constantly. Personally, I can't stand the times I have to wear them in the lab, so I wouldn't even want to think about wearing them out and about. Viruses have an easier entrance through the conjunctiva of your eyes than through your mouth, but these types of viruses aren't sneaky and going around in clouds that would necessitate closed goggles. To avoid direct droplet contact, your favorite, comfortable pair of eyeglasses (if you wear them) or sunglasses are enough to prevent droplets and may even prevent you from touching your eyes. But again, if you fiddle with them, they've just become useless vectors of virus.Hand sanitizer foam or gel, and washing your hands for the duration of the Happy Birthday song twice are your go-to preventatives: but you already knew that.  And for goodness sake, don't go to an urgent care or ER for any reason without first calling your doctor/ child's pediatrician (or their after-hours phone service) and getting an order to go in. This should be the rule all the time but especially now. Your doctor can even call the ER ahead of time so you don't have to get stuck waiting in the waiting room with all the other sickies, so it's a win-win. An R0 around 3 means that in order to stop the virus, our control measures need to prevent 60% of infections that would happen without them. That's doable! No reason for doomsday just yet, we health professionals will be trying to do our best to keep the sick isolated and you guys just do your part to protect yourselves and we'll all be okay (probably).",Let's get this on the front page.

fgfu2r4,-0.5719,0.0," I think the country that will end up with large outbreak problems is the USA. The percentage of Americans who avoid medical care of any kind is high because of the extreme expense of the privatized system. Many drastically ill people even use public transportation and taxi type services to get to the hospital because of the high cost of ambulances. Because most Americans now live a paycheck at a time and few have savings, many will also be more likely to go to work ill, thereby increasing the spread.Another issue is that although the US used to have public hospitals in every average city and a good public heath support system (that was started after the Spanish Flu of 1918) it basically no longer exists. In case of emergency, there is nothing to rapidly deploy.That is a highly volatile situation.","Most accurate stats yet, updates every 15 seconds, cycles maps and related stories with sources",2020-02-02 19:28:47,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ey0m5b/most_accurate_stats_yet_updates_every_15_seconds/

I've been reading so much about this virus, and it's been messing with my mind & my heart - and somehow, I feel the end is near for me because I have a weak immune system. I feel like i am living in a movie or a dream. With that being said, I've stocked up on foods & vitamins to prepare myself for worst case scenario. I'd like to point out a few things: First and foremost, what you must remember is that headlines love to cater to the doomsday scenario, it's what gives them clicks. So, while it is important to stay up to date what will be your grandest weapon of defense is to understand everything that is happening with a rational mind. Your mind is what's going to allow you to survive. Second of all, the possibility of this becoming a pandemic is still not effective to say. Many ""experts"" will have an opinion on this matter, but we still have a long way to go. The unpredictability of this virus is scary, but we must hope for the best.The best thing to do to help you psychologically is to let go of control and just ride the wave. If this is meant to be a pandemic, ride it out like a true baddie and keep doing what's best for your immune system and taking preventative measures.

fggvx2o,0.2498,0.0,"My modeling of the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù numbers (before PRoC ran into test-kit shortages / scaling limits) was that it had an R0 of ~2.3, leading to a 50-55% per day increase, which is pretty awful (and I personally think entirely accurate). We don‚Äôt have any hard data to support an R0 of 4, which seems absurdly high. Furthermore, US cases doubling in 3 days is in keeping with the R0 of 2.3. Keep in mind, my model, projected out (and backed by other models) would indicate that ‚Äúreal‚Äù cases has now passed 80,000.That said, I‚Äôll be the first to admit that all the data coming out of the PRoC is highly suspect, clearly has a hard mathematical limiter since the ~28th (likely due to available test kits) and the 5-14 day incubation period and possible asymptomatic carrier, all make mathematical modeling very difficult. Forget the R0 of 4, just the 2.3 that I (and others) believe is mathematically supported, is incredibly serious when talking about a 2% fatality rate for a virus that incubates over a week to two week period. It‚Äôs damn near perfect, because initial spread is slow enough to appear manageable (when it really isn‚Äôt), playing off human normalcy bias. If people, on average, were better at top-of-mind extrapolation, all travel in and out of the PRoC would have been shutdown a week ago.","U.S. Cases nearly double within 3 days, with more speculated cases in NYC.",2020-02-02 20:31:14,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ey1fb4/us_cases_nearly_double_within_3_days_with_more/

But when the Chinese government does it, it's suddenly sinister. Give me a break!Chen's reaction to document 10 is also strange because, since the 9th amendment to China's Criminal Law in 2015, he can be arrested for spreading ""rumors"" during disasters (including epidemics)^(1) . They don't need the excuse of quarantine to stop meddling amatuer journalists. They already have multiple legal and supralegal mechanisms to stop them.Chen is a lawyer and would be aware of this.On a side note, police disguising themselves to gain access to homes is a pretty common tactic. This is because Chinese apartments typically have strong metal doors with large locks. Police usually disguise themselves as utilities fee collectors or repair people then burst in when you open the door.
