fi6bci6,-0.8986,0.4019,"The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife as have so many other emerging pathogens. This is further supported by a letter from the presidents of the US National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine13 and by the scientific communities they represent. Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus. We support the call from the Director-General of WHO to promote scientific evidence and unity over misinformation and conjecture. We want you, the science and health professionals of China, to know that we stand with you in your fight against this virus.","Statement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China combatting COVID-19 - The Lancet",2020-02-20 00:13:43,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6pzq5/statement_in_support_of_the_scientists_public/

It gives a great demonstration of just how powerful propaganda and authoritarian regimes are over its network of automatons and district leaders.  It's only a few years old, so you can apply that methodology to examples like this and objectively come to your own conclusions. You will watch how a woman who is in her 80's talks about performing 50-60K abortions and forced sterilizations for the state and men who's job it was to ram-sack and destroy households of people who got pregnant.   You'll see babies discarded in the dump or left on the side of the road to die or ""hopefully"" be picked up for human trafficking for a better life. Yes, nothing is more important than human life. In Psychology there is a term that goes something like ""the bigger the front, the bigger the back"".  Much like the very vocal anti-gay priest who rails against gays all day long while having his homosexual encounters at night.   We can bet that if Wang Zhonglin says that nothing is more important than human life, that it is in fact, the very last thing that motivates him.

firattc,0.2386,0.0,"No like I said they are distinct. They are measuring a specific type of activity, namely to do with chopping up Angiotensin (Ang) II I believe. This activity is independent of ACE2 acting as a receptor.As an enzyme, ACE2 might either be on the cell surface acting or may float around the cytoplasm (not sure on specifics just giving as an example) and bind to substrates and process them. As a receptor, it probably exists on the cell surface and binds to proteins that exist on the virus causing a signal transduction event which allows the virus to enter cells.There is no requirement for one to work to allow the other to work i.e. ACE2 may have 0 expression at the cell membrane and have high specific enzymatic activity for a particular substrate.Activity is looking at for a given substrate, how quickly does it react with it to give the products. For expression, they ask how much protein or mRNA for that gene has the cell produced, it is completely separate to the specific activity.

fi6ydw1,0.9354,0.0,"Full Text :SINGAPORE - When Mr Wang, a tourist from China, was admitted to hospital on Jan 24, he only had a slight cough but felt well otherwise.Over the next few weeks, the cough persisted, but the 37-year-old Chinese national did not have any other symptoms such as a runny nose or fever.Tests had shown, however, that he was infected with coronavirus despite the mild symptoms.""It was quite similar to having a cold, and for my case, it felt less severe than a cold,"" the Wuhan native said in an interview in Mandarin with the media on Thursday (Feb 20).""When I have a cold, I sometimes get a more serious cough or runny nose, but I didn't have these symptoms this time. Maybe I am lucky in this aspect.""Mr Wang, who did not want to reveal his full name, still had to be hospitalised at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for four weeks as tests throughout that time still found he was still infected.He was finally discharged on Thursday, after two consecutive tests found him to be clear of the virus.His father, 66, the first coronavirus patient in Singapore, was discharged a day earlier, having also stayed in hospital for a period of 28 days.The pair, along with Mr Wang's children and a few family members had flown into Singapore for a 10-day holiday on Jan 20.The holiday was disrupted after Mr Wang's father started running a fever on the family's second day in Singapore.The fever fell and rose again and he felt cold and warm intermittently. Mr Wang took his father SGH, which confirmed the infection. This made him the first coronavirus patient here and Mr Wang, himself, was found to be infected on Jan 24, making him the third coronavirus patient here.""I wasn't very worried as I saw from the news that the disease was more severe for those who are with old age and who have underlying symptoms, but I was worried about my dad who's older,"" said Mr Wang.""He had pneumonia, so he had to use a respirator for the first few days to get more oxygen into his blood. He felt a bit unwell, but the doctor told us that his condition was stable so we felt more assured.""Mr Wang's father told The Straits Times that he was felt unwell for about three days. ""It wasn't too unbearable, and I was less worried after my condition stabilised.""He passed his time making phone calls to his son and family members. ""I also started practising a bit of martial arts inside the isolation room. I have practised for more than 10 days,"" he said with a grin.""I made sure to complete all my meals too as I wanted to stay optimistic and defeat the virus.""The younger Mr Wang passed his time reading books, watching shows and calling his family members.While both father and son had to spend some time in hospital despite feeling well, they said they were well taken care of. The nurses helped to get them dumplings on the eve of Chinese New Year so that they can fulfil a Chinese tradition signifying the changing of years, and also gave them treats like home-made soup.Now that they have recovered, they will spend a few days recuperating in Singapore, before heading home to Wuhan.Mr Wang said: ""I had bak kut teh before and I liked it. I want to bring my dad to try the dish, it will be a nice ending to our time here.""",Coronavirus: 'It was similar to having a cold' - Wuhan tourist whose father was Singapore's first case,2020-02-20 06:52:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6u5fe/coronavirus_it_was_similar_to_having_a_cold_wuhan/

fi7f7md,-0.8981,0.0,"Amid Coronavirus, U.S. Cities Stretch to Monitor Self-Quarantined AmericansPublic-health officials in the U.S. are striving to keep tabs on thousands of Americans who have quarantined themselves at home after returning from mainland China to curtail the new coronavirus, adding to an epidemic response that is straining already-stretched local departments.More than 5,400 people had been asked to self-quarantine in California alone as of Feb. 14, according to the California Department of Public Health. Hundreds more are self-quarantining in Georgia, Washington state, Illinois, New York and other states.Public-health officials are following directions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to supervise these people, but many steps are being developed on the fly. States are using a variety of techniques to track people from calling in volunteers to make phone calls, to sending text messages and using electronic registries.These people are separate from the Americans who are under stricter federal quarantine, including those housed at four U.S. air bases and the 328 who were recently evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those groups arrived from locations where the virus was rapidly spreading, whereas the people self-monitoring at home are thought to be at lower risk of having been exposed to it.So far, there have been 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S., not including the potentially positive cases among those evacuated from the Diamond Princess. While health officials have investigated 479 people for the virus as of Wednesday, 412 tested negative, with 52 cases pending, according to the CDC. The immediate risk to the general public is still low, health officials say.While public-health authorities are experienced with isolating, contact tracing and quarantining people to contain infectious diseases such as measles and tuberculosis, an attempt to monitor and quarantine people at this scale is a unique challenge. And quarantines typically apply only to those with a known exposure to a virus, rather than just travel history, public-health officials say.‘ That’s a whole new scope of work,” said Sara Cody, director of the public-health department in Santa Clara County, the home of Silicon Valley, which has had two confirmed cases of Covid-19. Both patients had returned from Wuhan, China, where the epidemic began.A coalition of staffers, employees from other departments, health-care providers and federal officials engaged in a classic outbreak response to monitor people, such as family and health-care workers, who came in close contact with two local cases. And now, the department has added tracking recent arrivals from China to its to-do list.“We’re still in the middle of figuring out these operations,” Dr. Cody said.Travel from mainland China to the U.S. has been sharply curtailed since many airlines suspended flights and the U.S. barred entry to most foreign nationals arriving from China.Still, some Americans continue to arrive into 11 airports designated by federal officials, and health authorities are on the lookout for passengers who are coming from other countries but were also recently in China.Los Angeles County, for instance, is adding dozens of returning travelers to its monitoring list daily, said Barbara Ferrer, the director for the L.A. County Department of Public Health.Those without symptoms who haven’t been to Hubei province, which includes Wuhan, are allowed to go on to their final destinations, but are asked to stay at home for up to 14 days, monitor their health, check in with their local health departments and contact their health-care providers if they develop symptoms, such as a fever or dry cough. They are asked to avoid close contact with others, typically defined as being within 6 feet of another person for a prolonged period.Sometimes those who are self-quarantining are told they may go outside and exercise if no one is nearby, or grocery shop. The orders aren’t binding, but local health officials can issue stricter quarantine orders if necessary. So far, most people are cooperative, local health officials say.State and local health officials say they get information on people who are self-quarantining from federal officials who screen them at airports. But sometimes local officials receive incorrect or illegible phone numbers for some, or just missing data for others, and have to circle back to federal authorities for more information to track down the person.Seattle and King County in Washington state, which have roughly 400 people self-monitoring at home, have recruited volunteers from the University of Washington School of Public Health and the department’s Public Health Reserve Corps, said Jeffrey Duchin, the health officer at Public Health-Seattle and King County. The county is spending roughly $200,000 a week on the response, which also requires redirecting staff from other tasks.For people under strict quarantine or in isolation after developing symptoms, public-health workers sometimes need to provide more intense services, including shopping for food and medication. Seattle and King County offer a dietitian-reviewed menu and deliver bagels, turkey lunch meat, avocado salsa, fruit and hair conditioner, among other items, to a person under investigation waiting for test results.“The amount of manpower, both resources and time, has been tremendous, and so what that means is that our existing staff are working two jobs around the clock for several weeks,” said Dr. Duchin. “It’s been like one big, long bad day.”In Chicago, the health department is surveying people daily with an electronic registry, which is part of its monitoring practice for other infectious diseases, and is in contact with them more directly as needed. Other health departments phone or email initially, then sometimes follow up in a few days or a week.On Monday, the Washington State Department of Health started using a text-messaging system developed by the CDC. The state will send a daily text to new arrivals and will refer anyone who reports fever or other symptoms to their local health departments. Washington says it is the first state to use the system.The CDC has made the tool available to any interested health departments and is using it to check in on some of its own staff on the ground responding to the epidemic in the U.S., said Anita Patel, the lead of pandemic medical care and countermeasures at the CDC.Public-health authorities say they are also working to fight xenophobia and misinformation around the virus. The Chicago Department of Public Health held a press conference in Chinatown  last week to announce that all of the close contacts of their two Covid-19 cases had passed the incubation period and had been cleared—and then the team had lunch with local business leaders in Chinatown.The effort is straining state and local budgets. States and some larger local departments receive support from the CDC’s Public Health Emergency Preparedness funds, though the money is meant for preparing for an outbreak and doesn’t often cover full responses, they say.“We’ve been keeping close track of those costs and expenditures with the assumption that there would be additional funding available in time,” said Allison Arwady, the commissioner at the Chicago Department of Public Health. “We’re paying our bills right now, but we absolutely need additional funding to be able to maintain the level of response this is going to require.”Many health departments say they are in a good spot for now, as close contacts to the early confirmed cases are passing the incubation period without new infections popping up. But based on the continuing spread of the coronavirus, some health officials expect to be on high alert for the long-term, saying this type of aggressive response might not be sustainable. Strategies might also need to shift if the virus gets a foothold in the U.S.“I just look around, and there are a lot of people here because they’re just committed to the mission, but they’re getting tired,” said Dr. Cody. “This is what they believe in, and that takes us a long way, but it won’t take us for months and months and months.”","5,400 under quarantine in California",2020-02-20 09:26:37,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f6wdyq/5400_under_quarantine_in_california/

Since China stamps your passport for exit and entry it’s pretty hard to lie and bypass for most people. But if you have dual citizenship and two passports I guess it is possible (China doesn’t allow this so it won’t be a problem with Chinese nationals). If you aren’t a US citizens or permanent resident they won’t even allow you to board the plane in Hong Kong airport if you are holding a Chinese passport.

fi89wik,0.9929,0.0,"It should be noted the particular church in South Korea [is a megachurch widely considered a coercive religious group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shincheonji_Church_of_Jesus_the_Temple_of_the_Tabernacle_of_the_Testimony)\--and is one of those groups that is euphemistically referred to as ""high demand"" (in that pretty much the entirety of the social life of the members is supposed to revolve around the church and church-related activities) and apparently uses[a rather MLM-like organizational structure that tends to be common across coercive ""Bible-based"" groups into ""discipling and shepherding""](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2007/8/11/370152/-Dominionist-cell-churches-and-religious-abuse).This group seems to be particularly modeled on the Unification Church/Moonies in how it operates, but with a fair amount added from certain New Apostolic Reformation-linked coercive groups into the ""Discipling and Shepherding"" thing, Maranatha in particular (no relation to the nut butter manufacturers).  Considering [the world's largest NAR-linked megachurch historically was based in South Korea and functionally operated as the Assemblies of God in that country](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/10/23/260706/-The-Most-Influential-Dominionist-You-ve-Never-Heard-Of) and arguably [the entire ""MLM""/""Discipling and Shepherding"" model may well have originated in South Korea](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2007/8/10/369739/-Dominionist-cell-churches-a-history) (via Soka Gakkai), it's not really surprising that coercive ""Bible-based"" groups in South Korea tend to glom on that model...and churches that start out culty, or go culty, *are* a definite problem in South Korea in particular.(And probably the *last* thing I expected to actually be discussing on what is functionally a ""pop epidemiology"" subreddit was how coercive religious groups operate, but that particular subject seems to follow me despite my best intentions.  Then again, having actually grown up in probably one of the first ""transmissions"" of NAR theology out of that million-member megachurch that pretty much invented the concept of Pyramid-Structured Churches...this does give me some unique insight. \*shrugs\*)Now, as for the epidemiology (and if there's anything I never expected to discuss anywhere, it's the epidemiology of infectious diseases in ""Bible-based cults"" outside of the context of people refusing to vaccinate their kids against childhood illnesses because they think the shots are made from Baby Slurry)...In these sorts of groups, pretty much *your entire world is supposed to be the cult*; about the only permissible activity outside of it is ""missionary"" activity dedicated to drawing in new members, and generally this isn't allowed until someone is well and truly ""set in"".  Before that, there is an awful lot of fear induction of the outside world, isolation from the outside world, fluffing-up that Only The Cult Can Save The World, and a LOT of tugging on the heartstrings--both negative (the fear of Outside) and positive (the cult is promoted as the only source of actual safety).  [Most of the actual tactics used actually tend to be common across coercive groups](https://freedomofmind.com/bite-model/), whether it be Scientology, the Moonies, NXIVM, the New Apostolic Reformation, or Shincheonji Church of Jesus, or even non-religious cults of personality.Some cults also do things like communal dinners and communal childrearing (sometimes large scale, sometimes smaller scale--""Bible-based cults"", of note, tend to go for things like the ultimate point of contact being a ""cell church group"" of six to twelve people with a leader who may meet as often as daily, but you do get some groups like the Moonies that do things like the ""mass weddings"", and the New Apostolic Reformation has a ""distinguisher"" of massive ""outpourings""--huge revival meetings that run continuously for months or even over a year at  a time that people will attend on a daily or multiple-times-a-week basis).In terms of epidemiology...this means that pretty much all of your contacts (by and large) will be within the cult, you'll be meeting up with your cult members frequently, and--because of the ""pyramidal scale""--even your cell church leader will be meeting up with THEIR supervisory cell, and THAT leader with HIS cell, and so on all the way up to the leader of the church.  And pretty much all of your social contacts, even for things like entertainment, shopping, possibly even visiting the doctor...are all going to be contacts within the cult.Which makes it incredibly, *incredibly* easy for Contagious Stuff to spread.  (More than one measles outbreak has ultimately been traced to a homeschooler's group, and at least one other multistate epidemic was ultimately traced to an Old Order Amish pastor who went on a missionary trip to an Amish colony in the Philippines and brought back an unwelcome gift.)  Really, a high-demand coercive religious group is one of the *best* potential places for a disease to spread--especially as a lot of these groups tend to put a heavy emphasis on trying to cure an illness with the power of prayer before seeing the doctor.Of course, the bad part is...well...cults like to recruit people, and are not above setting up front businesses or (in particularly extreme cases) setting up fake relationships (either as friends, or even as romantic partners) to pull you into the cult.  And they do missionary activity which makes it easy for that stuff to spread.(Again, I think the last thing I expected to ever talk about here is the epidemiology of what happens with a COVID-19 outbreak in a Moonies-esque high-demand religious cult!)",Major Gatherings,2020-02-20 13:29:32,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f703zn/major_gatherings/

What is far more believable to me is that by delaying testing and putting people into quarantine (imposes or otherwise), they allow Americans to become familiar with it before it starts hitting close to home. If the first people heard about the virus was that their friends started dying, people would understandably fear the worst and panic. Panic is incredibly dangerous from a government perspective. Here’s how I expect it to play out: They’ll get the “problem“ sorted out in a day or two, and we’re going to start hearing about a rising number of increasing cases starting in about a week. Slow at first, and then suddenly much quicker once we have a few deaths under our belt.

I work in the public sector and things have gotten very serious with study abroad trip cancellations and most recently, every desk got a pair of goggles. Yeah, like they’re going to do anything. 🤦🏻‍♂️I have to travel extensively most of the year on public transport. I’d avoid it if I could but that’s just not possible. Thing is, it’s somewhat of a lottery right now. Sorry to put it that way but it is. The Japanese government is incompetent and the DP boat is proof. They’re completely mishandling the situation and vilifying creditable sources like the good doc who had to pull his videos offline to avoid the backlash. Too late. The internet never forgets.The best thing you can do - and one I have been very diligent with - is self sanitization. Carry some alcohol rub, make sure to avoid public restrooms, wash hands to and from work and in between as often as you feel it’s necessary and hope - yes, HOPE - you’re not one of the people infected. Like you, I have family and If I or they contracted it, obviously we don’t want anyone else getting it.What makes this one so hard to contain is that you might not even know you have it but are passing it on. I’m not 100% sure if they’re just panic selling the narrative but they are also saying it can be up to 14 days and over before you show any symptoms. This bastard of a virus seems to be going after the sick, weak and elderly. But it is also killing perfectly healthy men and women in their 20’s and 30’s.If you CAN take leave, do so. It is not unreasonable to take precautionary measure to protect yourself but the gaman culture here literally wants to shame you for doing so as it’s seen as unnecessary panic.Even though I’m not Japanese I don’t buy any of that bullshit because at the end of the day, nobody wants this and yet, because the government was SO fucking slow to do anything about it at the outset, and when they finally did, they royally screwed it up, the spread to us in the general was inevitable.REGULARLY Keep your hands clean, watch your temperature and make sure everything at home is wiped down - doorhandles, surfaces, benches, especially around anything in the kitchen, and also your keyboard and cellphone - and you are mitigating the risk of exposure.

We have it under control. There are currently no cases reported in Florida and we strive to keep it that way."" FIU has been accused of hiding coronavirus cases since they recently brought back several students and staff from Tianjin, China. They have since sent about three e-mails to students and staff (I'm an FIU student) saying that the rumors are fake and there are no confirmed cases at FIU or in Florida. From what I've heard, Florida only has a few hospitals that will test for coronavirus and on top of that, you have to pay a large fee which will prevent those who can't afford it from getting a diagnosis. I don't mean to be doom and gloom, but the truth is that there isn't much we can do that would actually have an impact. If even health officials are powerless to do anything due to China's rigorous restrictions on what gets released to the public, what can any of us accomplish?

It's likely that it will spread, but for example the man's wife is 8 months pregnant and likely has not been working - read: not gone to school - during the last weeks because of this, so the fact that she is a teacher might not be, in this case, a 100% proof that the virus spread all over the school.3) ""Italian government banished flights from China too late"". We were the first country to apply this policy, what were we supposed to do more, declaring war on China and burn the whole country just to stop the virus from spreading?Stop assuming your government is the bad guy in every single instance, please.Yes, in the end it is likely more cases will emerge and more people in Italy will be infected.

fi8xcb1,-0.9898,0.4019,"The 14 coronavirus-stricken Americans evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan were flown back to the US on a plane full of healthy people against advice from the CDC, a report said Thursday. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials argued the 14 infected Diamond Princess passengers shouldn’t be flown back with the about 300 virus-free people — but ultimately lost the battle to the US State Department, according to The Washington Post. “It was like the worst nightmare,” an anonymous senior U.S. official involved in the decision told the paper.“Quite frankly, the alternative could have been pulling grandma out in the pouring rain, and that would have been bad, too.” The State Department had vowed that no one with the infection would be allowed on — but then urged health officials to let the sick, yet symptom-free, passengers board, the paper reported. The CDC worried about infection control aboard the planes. Principal deputy director Anne Schuchat wrote to the State Dept. that the stricken passengers would pose “an increased risk to the other passengers,” according to the report.But officials with the Department of Health and Human Services and the coronavirus task force pushed back, arguing that they had been prepared to handle passengers who might develop symptoms on the flights.“We were upset that people were knowingly put on the plane who were positive,” said Vana Mendizabal, 69, a retired nurse who took the cruise with her husband Mario. “I think those people should not have been allowed on the plane,” she added. “We feel we were re-exposed. We were very upset about that.”",Coronavirus-infected Americans flown back to US on plane full of healthy people,2020-02-20 18:01:38,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f73yiv/coronavirusinfected_americans_flown_back_to_us_on/

fi94av7,0.8583,0.0,"The general advice I give is:Walk through your house with a pen and paper, room by room, and take an inventory of all the things that you use up or consume on a regular basis. Then decide what you can't do without, on that list.&#x200B;1. Food is obvious. Figure out what you and your family like, and buy more of that, in shelf-stable form. Canned is probably your most cost effective option. If you really don't like pinto beans, don't buy beans -- figure something else out. For things that are perishable, like eggs or milk, you should decide if you can do without the perishable item or if you want to invest in an alternative. For example -- I have tried various egg powders and dislike them all. I will just skip fresh eggs in my diet, and substitute mayonnaise for eggs and oil in baked goods. On the other hand, I DO like fresh bread, and don't want to skip it, so I have all the ingredients to bake bread in my pantry/freezer. (Freeze the yeast, it lasts longer if you do.)2. Look around your kitchen and decide what else you need. Dish soap? Paper towels? Spices? Coffee filters? Open your junk drawer. Anything in there that you're going to need more of? (I keep batteries in my junk drawer ...) While you're at it, add paper plates, dixie cups, and disposable cutlery to the shopping list. If the power goes out for any reason (including just a random storm compounded by supply chain problems), you'll want that stuff. Or if you get sick, it's nice not to have to do dishes. Also add some flashlights and (more) batteries to the list.3. Bathroom -- toilet paper, shampoo, toiletries, feminine hygiene products.4. Open your medicine cabinet and all the drawers. What's in there that might run out?5. Got pets? Don't forget the pet food and kitty litter. 6. Home office -- printer ink? Paper? Might want to pick up a spare USB cord and charger or two, they're cheap and have a tendency to crap out. 7. Clothing -- got anything that's going to wear out soon? I decided I needed more underwear. Got laundry detergent and stain sticks?8. Kids -- they're going to be boooooored. Figure out something to entertain them. Arts and craft supplies, giant jigsaw puzzles, DVDs of movies and long TV series they might like, etc. (Note I said DVDs -- if everyone's confined to their homes, everyone might want to be online, and the internet might crap out. Thrift stores are a great source for DVDs of random movies and TV series.) You get the idea. Basically take an inventory of your life, and then buy more of whatever it is you need on regular basis. But also be judicious, if money's an issue, and decide on what you REALLY need.",Time to start prepping?

fi967rs,0.8171,0.0,"He's specifically talking about false negatives of RT-PCR> 王一民：核酸检测“假阴性”的情况是如何产生的，怎么对待？> > 赵建平：核酸检测为阴性，可能受很多因素的影响。首先，检测取材于鼻咽和口咽，但其实上呼吸道的病毒量是没有下呼吸道的病毒量大的，下呼吸道检测阳性率要高一点，但需要病人有痰，进行有创采样，不太现实。其次，“假阴性”还和医务人员取材的水平参差不齐有关系。另外还有检测试剂本身的问题。我们认为病人应该是阳性的，但是检测是阴性的，这个占比有多少呢？大概检测一次有30%到40%的阳性率，就是说本来是有病的，检测的时候只有30%到40%是阳性，60%到70%是检测不出来的。所以需要结合医生的经验，进行综合判断。>> 出院的判断也要慎重。我有一个病人，好转出院，两次检测阴性，但几天后又有点发烧，再做核酸检测又是阳性的。这种情况也是存在的，所以出院病例也要居家隔离14天。Wang Yimin: How do false negatives from RT-PCR occur? How do we handle them?Zhao Jianping: There are many factors that may lead to a negative RT-PCR result. First, the samples are taken from nasal cavity and throat swabs, but the viral load in upper respiratory tract is lower than lower respiratory tract (LCT). The true positive rate of LCT test is higher. But that requires either phlegm samples or invasive sampling which are not always realistic. Besides, false negatives may occur due to improper sampling preparation. The test kits might be problematic, too. Sometimes we think the patient does have CoV, but the test comes back negative. How many false negatives are out there? The true positive rate is about 30~40%. Which is to say that a CoV positive patient would only test positive 30~40% of the time. And 60%~70% of the time they would test negative. So you need to combine lab test results with clinical experience from doctors to make a diagnosis.And caution must be taken when releasing patients. I had a patient who recovered and tested negative twice. They had a fever a few days later and got a positive result when we redid the RT-PCR. This type of thing happens. So discharged patients must remain under home quarantine for 14 days.",Coronavirus traces found in recovered patients as China cases rise again,2020-02-20 19:31:12,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f754c2/coronavirus_traces_found_in_recovered_patients_as/

The sample alone is far too limited to provoke a visible reaction.  Having a visible reaction relies upon the number of replication cycles, denoted by a threshold cycle (or simply C^t .)Individuals may have a viral load which is only barely detectable at C^t and thus there will be in some variance in testing in a portion of those which are tested (particularly if there is some variability in the course of the condition, in terms of viral load.)Generally speaking, this is why multiple consecutive tests are used to confirm or disconfirm diagnosis.

Then, she stayed home to do home treatment, and she took a test and has just confirmed on Feb. 21. She is going to be hospitalized, but her condition is stable.

Families and (Defense Department) civilians are discouraged from traveling to and from Daegu,” the garrison said Wednesday in a Facebook post.“All visitors who are not performing mission essential or official business will be denied access to USAG Daegu military installation for the next 24 hours. This directive will be reassessed daily.”The garrison also warned people to expect delays at the gates due to a health screening questionnaire.The measures were implemented after health authorities said that at least 15 South Koreans confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 had attended the same church.All service members who’ve attended the New World Church … since Feb. 9 will undergo a mandatory self-quarantine — and is highly recommended for family members, civilians and contractors — until KCDC completes their contact trace procedures to determine who has been exposed to COVID-19,” USFK commander Gen. Robert Abrams said in a separate statement.The pneumonia-like disease has killed nearly 2,000 people — nearly all in mainland China — and infected tens of thousands more in nearly 30 countries, including South Korea and the United States.The infection toll in South Korea has spiked in recent days with dozens of new cases reported in Daegu, where a 61-year-old woman was believed to have been a carrier.The Daegu garrison, which includes Camp Walker and Camp Henry, said the nearby New World Church was off-limits until further notice for U.S. troops.The woman dubbed “patient 31” reportedly frequented the church, which is a branch of a religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.The garrison’s leadership urged self-quarantine for all community members in the area “to include our local national friends and base-support personnel” who attended the church in the last couple of weeks.“So far we don’t know of any Americans that attended that church,” garrison commander Col. Edward Ballanco said Thursday during an online town hall.He also highly encouraged Americans in the area to avoid a local hospital where the woman was treated.The garrison added that anybody feeling sick should contact the U.S. Forces Korea novel coronavirus 24-hour hotline (050-3337-2556 or DSN 737-2556) at the main military hospital at Camp Humphreys, the main U.S. military base in South Korea.USFK also has implemented self-quarantine measures for service members who recently have traveled to mainland China. However, the military has reported no confirmed cases and stressed the measures were “out of an abundance of caution.”The quarantine lasts for two weeks, which is believed to be the incubation period for the virus.“So far, 65 persons within USFK populations have been self-quarantined with 61 medically cleared for duty,” USFK spokesman Col. Lee Peters said Thursday in an email.“I'd like to emphasize that USFK has experienced zero resistance or non-compliance from anyone who is sick or feeling ill,” he added.The military also urged people to exercise good hygiene, including thoroughly and frequently washing hands and avoiding contact with people who are sick, or staying home if ill themselves.COVID-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that is similar to the SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past.gamel.kim@stripes.comTwitter: @kimgamel",The US military in South Korea has raised its danger level and urgently blocked all bases and facilities in Daegu due to the COVID-19 spread.,2020-02-20 21:02:38,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f767n7/the_us_military_in_south_korea_has_raised_its/

It’s still a battle in that most educated citizens of first world nations struggle to consistently use evidence-based decision making in their lives and careers, and the internet can spread crazy information people quickly buy into, like when my well educated, competent, very nice friend (who is in marketing) told me emphatically the other day that elderberry syrup definitely treats Coronavirus.Anyway....Coronavirus and other diseases are unique in that they are problems that are problems regardless of if people think they are problems. This unavoidable truth has allowed medicine to be an island of reason globally and allowed for its rapid development.However, the natural instincts of many politicians is to apply their political problem solving method, especially if they lack public health experience.

They're not in any way qualified to run affairs outside their narrow area of expertise, while politicians and bureaucrats have their own expertise in how to manage such affairs in their own fields. With an exceptional situation like this it is likely hard to find enough qualified people who have any real experience in handling it, so you're going to end up with people just trying to manage things as best they can, relying on the training and information they've been given.

fi9nbwt,0.9839,0.0,"The markets are being affected. Its just not openly obvious based on prices yet.  Right now whats happening (in the US at least) is there has been a flood of cash into safe haven assets. Things like Bonds, Gold, and Bitcoin (where people traditionally put their money during periods of market volatility or heightened risk) are all on the rise. However, at the same time the stock market is still riding a 10+ year bull rally. There's been a nearly continuous gain in a lot of tech stocks...with explosive growth in recent months (like Tesla). Many investors are looking at solid fundamentals for individual companies, despite potential future risk from the virus. They're still profitable, consumer spending is strong, GDP is growing, unemployment is low, and interest rates are low.  Analysts are treating this like the market is going to make the same rapid ""V"" recovery as it did after SARS. The shared assumption is this will blow over quickly, and any economic losses will be made up in the 2nd half of the year. In the eyes of Wall Street, this is a non-event...a temporary blip.  Since Wall Street is also pretty hell-bent on making sure the Dow hits 30,000 this year, they're riding the wave of optimism, pumping the market. The Fed has been intervening as well by injecting a ton of liquidity into the market via Bond repurchases/repo operations. This has been propping up the numbers while keeping investor nerves at ease. But the fact that stocks are rising at the same time as safe-havens is pretty indicative of a bubble about to burst if I've ever seen one. As soon as more companies start making announcements like significantly reduced revenue forecasts, shortages, or layoffs...anything that would indicate sustained impact for more than a quarter...thats when you'll see stock prices start to really drop. Could start as soon as next week if the South Korea outbreak advances.As for China, their numbers can only be taken with a grain of salt. Its a psuedo free-market system. The central communist government still has nearly full control over many industries and the financial markets. They have been dumping liquidity to keep them propped up, while enacting measures to help spur spending like loosening restrictions for borrowing and lowering interest rates. But they can also pretty much puppeteer the numbers however they want.",Just another day in lala land.,2020-02-20 22:53:33,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f77duk/just_another_day_in_lala_land/

Now the total amount existing in values are hundreds of trillions, so in the end, the loss is easily overcomeable even if the loss was spread evenly on everyone.

But the complacency can continue a bit longer, as people tell themselves that the Fed cutting from 1.5% to zero can offset a lot of damage.

fia0dbx,-0.7506,-0.7906,"With an R0 between 3.0- 6.0, and a fatality rate of anywhere between 2%-10% this is orders of magnitude far deadlier, also depending on how fast you get treatment, and how well you recover, and with this there seems to be a good possibility of re-infection, I would say the the Los Alamos Lab report pointing to 4-5 million deaths is an underestimate My guess is at least 100 million within 36 months.
