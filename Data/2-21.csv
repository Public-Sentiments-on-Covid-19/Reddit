fi9rxtv,-0.8656,0.0,"A lot of people are preparing for 1-3 month disruptions, but it seems to me the cascading effects of this pandemic are going to be longer-lasting and will fundamentally change a lot of things we take for granted at the moment. And everyone's counting on this not becoming endemic to affected regions, even though the former FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, explicitly told the US Senate round-table on this topic that it looks as though it \*will\* becoming endemic, so we'll have flu season every year, and now we'll also have COVID-season every year.   Even though we might expect it to get milder in the future, the damage sustained to heart, kidneys, lungs and men's testes will cause people to be more susceptible to more severe symptoms in subsequent infections. So I'm curious how you think we should be preparing for the bigger picture. I'd say it's a good time to sell property now, before it plunges as the elderly are hardest hit by this bug and they are the largest group of homeowners. Probably a good time to buy crypto, since fiat currencies will tumble for a while. Stocking up medicines, condoms, non-perishable foods, paper-products, and liquor/coffee (for bartering purposes). Probably a good idea to quit jobs that include a lot of face-to-face contact. Sales, servers, flight-attendants. But what jobs will be more in demand, besides healthcare industry? Manufacturing I suppose... Is it time to move to a small village somewhere now before panic hits in the cities and things get a bit crazy?

As for the leadership of MHLW (Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare) as well as Minister Kato and Deputy Minister Hashimoto, I think the scandal on the quarantine system of the cruise ship, following the cancelled video of the infectious doctor, indeed epitomizes the problem, i.e. their inadequate capability of facing the current problems.

The test fee in Japan is officially already free (made up by the public expenditure), so the problem is not the cost of the test itself, but the lingering unofficial hesitation of the public health center or alike of conducting the test extensively. Alternatively, patients might afraid that they lose possible opportunity of the income (for part-time worker), good assessment by their superior, or even the job itself.

fi9rngm,-0.8146,-0.624,"This is my approach to the data: anything reported about the progress of the disease in the MSM is stone cold evidence. Numbers of cases, numbers of deaths, these are all a certain minimum.Guidance and advice upon how to adjust your behaviour I approach with a little more caution — governments and the media are definitely going to be interested in mitigating the spread of the disease. We can trust them when they tell you to wash your hands not travel to hot zones, etc etc. It may be judicious to err on the side of caution here, so to go further than government advice, but the advice they give you is not going to be actively bad.In terms of the rate of infection and predictions about the true or final spread of the disease, I’m taking the numbers reported in the media as a baseline. I don’t think the organisations I am reading are actively and consciously trying to minimise the scale of the disaster. However, I do believe their standards of evidence and the ways they measure the quality of sources means they are probably under-reporting the scale of the disease. Not through malice: through lack of “quality” information. There are especially alarming developments (such as the two deaths without previous cases in Iran) that suggest things could be much worse than we have been told, but again not through malice just paucity of “confirmed” information.I then approach the material of a more anecdotal and personal nature with a sliding scale of dubiousness. Some anecdotal conjecture has proven very accurate (I heard about the jump in cases in Korea shortly before they were published in the MSM). Some I think is much less reliable — for example, I’ve seen dozens of breathless, panicked posts about the disease spreading in the UK, despite zero evidence and extensive testing by the UK health service. I’ll keep that as a data point In my head until there is further evidence.Think of it as rating all of the data, and believing it by an approximate percentage:I 100% believe there have been at least 76000 cases worldwide. I 90% believe there have been 10-20000 more cases than that, 80% believe there have been 20-35000 more cases, etc etc. I 100% believe there have been at least 5 cases in Iran. I 95% believe there have been hundreds more than that either not discovered or not reported. I 100% believe there have been 9 cases in the UK. I 90% believe there might be 1-2 more. I 10% believe there might be hundreds more.Obviously, these attitudes are all subject to change as more data points emerge.Finally, don’t get sucked in by the doomsayers and the panic. There is valuable information there, and we should definitely be taking the spread of the virus seriously, but they provide just another data point; we should look at the whole of the data in combination, not try and decide which one person has the right story. The truth is probably somewhere spread across all of the information.","Is mainstream media, together with the techgiants Google, Facebook, etc, consciously downplaying this outbreak, in line with the world's governments, or is that total bullshit.",2020-02-21 01:26:49,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f78pnq/is_mainstream_media_together_with_the_techgiants/

fia9jy1,-0.7353,-0.624,"It is possible that mainstream media is playing down coverage to prevent panic.  And if you think about it for a moment, they probably SHOULD play down coverage.Realistically, what exactly is Joe Schmoe, our average guy (or gal), going to do with minute by minute coverage of this health crisis, except panic and take actions likely directly contradictory to the best interests of reduction of the virus on a mass scale? He will think he is helping himself, and possibly to a limited extent might help himself.  But his actions in his own self interest are quite likely to be detrimental to the interests of the masses. And in the end, he is also one of the masses, so ...Joe will “prep” and buy medical supplies he doesn’t really know how to use, and put them in place when he may not even need them for quite some time, depending on his location. We have already seen how this removes those supplies out of the stock needed for trained medical professionals, actual victims of the disease, and those who are most vulnerable (pre existing lung conditions), thereby worsening the overall outbreak.He will get on social media claiming to have “figured it out” that the government is covering things up, that according to his middle school math knowledge the virus some crazy percentage of fatal, and it’s R value (something he just heard about last week) is 14, inciting other Joes to “prep” and evangelize. This will all seem valid to Joe because he will have come to these conclusions based on “the literature “ which he has never been trained to read.He may even attempt to “identify spreaders” through huge generalizations, or worse, attempt to “pin point” individuals, through his online sleuthing, causing possible harm to come to innocent people.In short, Joe is doing no favors to his fellow man.  And frankly, he is likely not doing any favors to himself by attempting to become an expert in virology in a month. He is, by his actions, possibly making it more likely he will be exposed to the disease (by limiting equipmentthat could be better utilized elsewhere to stop the spread before it gets to him, by making any number of half true decisions about what is safe to do based on dubious “knowledge”). He will make himself a prime target for serious infection by obsessing and staying up all night on his theories, thereby weakening his immune system. He will likely ignore any official information provided, because he will believe that the government is covering things up regardless of the truth of those statements, and may not even heed the prevention instructions (hand washing, not touching face, etc) because they are too simple and he wants something that feels more “official”, like the precautions urged to those on the front line fighting the disease. It is much more like an action movie that way. And of course, if the government IS covering things up, that is always a bad thing, because Joe knows how to fend for himself, as you can see by his wise actions.","Is mainstream media, together with the techgiants Google, Facebook, etc, consciously downplaying this outbreak, in line with the world's governments, or is that total bullshit.",2020-02-21 01:26:49,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f78pnq/is_mainstream_media_together_with_the_techgiants/

For the more serious cases Pneumonia sets in about day 9 of symptoms, and we know it has a relatively long incubation period.  So say it arrived here sometime mid January. Say January 15th, before the travel ban. 1 case, fairly mild never goes to the doctor and starts coughing say the 20th spreading it to 4 people.  Those people don't get sick till the 25th/28th, only 20% of cases are serious. There's a good chance they don't get serious, and even if one does it doesn't impact the data.  Say of the 4 people 3 are mild and  1 is serious.   The serious case probably wouldn't even end up in the hospital till February 4th.   Say each person infected 2 other people around day 5 (when you start coughing, though we have plenty of evidence that it could be longer).   February 1st you now have a cluster of 13, 8 of which probably won't start coughing till about February 5th and won't come down with pneumonia(if they get it) till February 14th.Even if the hospitalized patent dies they probably would have died around February 8th, the secondary spread wouldn't be in danger until around February 18th.This is with an incubation period of 5 days, one guy in Italy apparently had a 21 day incubation!

Also, here is the only study that even remotely suggests incubation periods beyond 14 days, this is the one almost everyone is citing for the 24 day number, and even they claim the median incubation period is 3 days. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020974v1",Coronavirus has spread to several Iranian cities: health ministry official -Reuters,2020-02-21 04:39:03,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7air4/coronavirus_has_spread_to_several_iranian_cities/

Asymptomatic and low risk people aren't going to be tested until the kits are ready.

fiaao8h,-0.9646,-0.34," A second university is offering Chinese students a financial incentiv­e to study this semester despite the coronavirus travel ban, as the federal government prepare­s to ease the ban enough to allow some students to enter Australi­a directly from China.On Friday, the University of Adelaide emailed its 3000 or so Chinese students caught overseas by the ban offering a “care package” worth about $5000 — a 20 per cent discount on first-­semester tuition fees plus airfare support of up to $2000, which they will be eligible for once the travel ban is lifted.Acting on medical advice, the government is planning to allow about 1000 Chinese research stud­ents to enter directly from China in a week’s time. After that it will consider allowin­g other groups of Chinese students to fly directly to Australia, although it is not clear how the groups will be selected.The plan to ease the ban is based on [expert advice ](https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-recommendation-on-travel-restrictions-and-coronavirus-covid-19)to the government which said it can consider relaxing restrictions from February 29 if coronavirus case numbers in China, outside Hubei province, do not show a “material increase”.The government’s official expert group, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, also said that if epidemiological indicators remained as they were, the entry of Chinese students “would not materially increase the current low risk of importation of cases from mainland China (outside of Hubei province)”.Meanwhile, increasing numbers of Chinese students are beating the travel ban by travelling to third countries, where they must spend a 14-day quarantine period before entering Australia.Ben, a student enrolled at RMIT who did not want to give his full name, said he planned to fly to Australia on February 23. He said he was not confident of getting in, “but I must take the risk”.Melbourne education consultant Gary Li, who is in Bangkok to assist Chinese students transiting to Australia, said his students did not regret choosing the third-country option because they don’t know how long the travel ban will be in force.The Group of Eight univer­sities, where most of the 100,000 Chinese students caught by the ban are enrolled, said it wanted its students back on campus as soon as possible. Go8 chief executive Vicki Thomson said the group appreciated and welcomed the government considering the medical advice. “We will explore all options to see what can be achieved with government support,” she said.But Ian Jacobs, vice-chancellor of Go8 university UNSW, warned against a “piecemeal relaxation” of the travel ban. “I’m sure that any relaxation would be well-intentioned but it could end up causing confusion and even more anxiety, and be very difficult to imple­ment,” he said.The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee said in its advice to the government that students entering directly from China would “need to agree to self-isolation in Australia” and universities would need to support that.The committee is made up of the state and territory chief health officers and is chaired by Australia’s Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy. In its statement, the committee also revealed that the China travel ban could be relaxed for a small number of other cases, including Year 11 and 12 school stud­ents, as long as they were not from Hubei province.Western Sydney University this week offered its stranded Chinese students $1500 towards the cost of beating the travel ban by transiting a third country but the University of Adelaide is not encouraging that option.But it is offering each of its stranded Chinese students a personalised study plan and will allow them to study online until June 1, when they need to be on campus to complete first semester face-to-face. The university will give late-arriving Chinese students inten­sive tutorials to help them complete their studies on time.","A second Australian university is now paying Chinese students to bypass travel ban through third countries.

The real worries around here are (I'm from Lombardy, the opposite side of Milan):\- the poor guy had been sick for a while, went to the hospital (8 infected among doctors and patients now) and was sent back with antibiotics. Since he had no recent travel history to China, nobody thought it could be that.  \- it's unknown who the first spreader is/was. They thought it was a friend of the very sick dude, who came back from China on Jan 21 (they didn't say where he was in China, could have been Hubei, as it was pre-lockdown). But after testing, results came back negative and he has not had any sign of sickness. They are checking tampons to see if his body developed antibodies, to see if it could have been the ultimate case of asymptomatic spreading.  \- there have been other cases in some retirees, no contact with the very sick guy. But contact with a friend of his who also tested positive and who (as it is understood) worked in his dad's bar in Cologno.   \- add to the drama that the guy's wife is now infected and 8-month pregnant.

fibs2i8,0.9362,0.4588,"Our media and our government have been asleep at the wheel on this issue.What our various levels of government in Canada are reporting are termed ""confirmed cases"".  They have defined what a confirmed case is and it requires double testing.  They have also defined what the bar is to qualify for the double testing in the first place.  As such, they can control how many cases are tested.  The bar, as I have discussed previously, is essentially that you are in material distress with symptoms of COVID-19 AND you have recently been to Wuhan or in contact with someone who has.  That's a VERY small net for what is now a clearly global outbreak.It is statistically unlikley, based on the academic models and based on what we are seeing in Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Iran and Italy that Canada only has or has had the 10-12 cases that the government has reported.  Again, what they are telling us is the ""confirmed cases"".  They are playing weasel words so they can't be accused of lying when history judges them.It looks increasingly likely that they understand how quickly and widely this will spread and they have been using the high bar for testing to keep the quoted numbers down and keep people calm.  The US and Uk also appear guilty of this.  Hopefully they used the time to plan and position resources to respond to a ramp, should it come.  At least the US and the UK have regularly been scaling up their ""if it comes here, this is what will happen"" messaging, and demonstrating action.Before everyone piles on and calls me a prepper or a doomer, I'll just leave this snippet from today from the CDC here for you to digest.  No one appears to want to hear or digest the uncomfortable news.  Look closely at the last couple of sentences. The words are intentionally soft but digest what the CDC is saying is likley to be required in the US once this spreads (my emphasis in bold):[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-latest-updates-outbreak.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-latest-updates-outbreak.html)""1 pm: US health officials prepare for coronavirus outbreak to become pandemic[U.S. health officials are preparing for the COVID-19 coronavirus to become a pandemic,](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/us-health-officials-prepare-for-coronavirus-outbreak-to-become-pandemic.html)  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. “We’re not  seeing community spread here in the United States, yet, but it’s very  possible, even likely, that it may eventually happen,” Dr. Nancy  Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and  Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call. “Our goal  continues to be to slowing the introduction of the virus into the U.S.  This buys us more time to prepare communities for more cases and  possibly sustained spread.” **Messonnier pointed to China where schools  and businesses have been shuttered for weeks to contain the outbreak  there, saying the U.S. may eventually need to do the same.** ***“The day may  come where we may need to implement such measures in this country,”*** she  said. *— Lovelace, Feuer""*Canada is not immune.  It would be a good idea to make sure perscriptions are filled, your first aid kit is stocked, and you have adequate supplies at home to stay in for a few weeks in the coming month or two, if that is required.  Thankfully, it is likely we will continue to enjoy water, power, internet, TV etc.  So this isn't a doomsday scenario.Failing to plan is planning to fail.  Be responsible and invest in some supplies.  If the CDC is wrong, it's a small insurance premium.

fiauom5,-0.9848,0.0,"Actual advice (aside from the belt-tightening, which is also great advice):I have worked in financial institutions for years (in the USA) and am privy to the SOP for disasters. After a disaster occurs and an emergency is declared by local or federal government, the standard practice is to suspend payments for a period of time. (By the way, this usually happens during hurricane season, at least on a local level, so the practice is very familiar to every major financial institution.) This doesn't mean you won't have to pay, and the situation will depend on the financial institution, but generally speaking mortgages and utilities can have payments put on hold. And afterwards, during the recovery period, there is usually a call center helpline established by each company to help answer questions or concerns, should you have trouble paying after the hold period is over. Other creditors usually adopt the same plan, but not always. Hopefully this practice trickles down to renters in the form of landlords placing payments on hold (NOT always), but individuals will have to work out the payment plan with the landlords. I would say don't expect your landlord to have a plan for you until something happens, but it's also not in their best interests to kick people out during an emergency. **Always remember that when in doubt, you'll have to wait for the event and then call your creditor/landlord/etc to discuss the situation.**As far as work is concerned, if you have an office job, it may be worth asking your employer about the disaster plan, should a national emergency be declared by the government, advising people to stay in their homes.

fiatydd,0.0387,-0.34,"Full Text :To understand the potential painful impact of the coronavirus on the Fortune 1000 takes just one word: resin.When the 2011 earthquake and tsunami struck the Fukushima Prefecture of Japan, the electronics industry had a huge problem on its hands. Two Mitsubishi Gas Chemical factories in the affected area made almost the entire world's supply of an epoxy resin called bismaleimide triazine, or BT. Electronics chip manufacturers regularly used BT to seal their components. No BT, no chips, without a major manufacturing overhaul.""It was buried within a supply chain—a component of a component,"" said Josh Nelson, a principal in strategy and business transformation practice of The Hackett Group, a strategic consultancy.Now, as coronavirus continues to spread, the region of China most heavily affected by the outbreak is a hub of global supply chains. A new Dun & Bradstreet study estimates that 163 of the Fortune 1000 have tier 1 suppliers—those they do direct business with—in the area. And 938 have tier 2 suppliers, which feed the first tier.""That's where it becomes troubling,"" Nelson said. ""It's going to be that [item] where only one plant is qualified to make that and it's going to interrupt a whole production line.""The pinch is already being felt. Amazon has been stockpiling Chinese-made goods, Under Armour warned of a $50-$60 million potential shortfall in Q1, multiple automakers have shut down factories in China, and Nintendo expects ""inevitable"" production and shipment delays. And a growing number of companies have issued earnings warnings related to coronavirus.Beyond the already announced effects, many Fortune 1000 companies still don't know how seriously their operations will be affected. Although likely aware of tier 1 suppliers' statuses, they (and 5 million other companies globally, by Dun & Bradstreet's estimation) have little interaction with the tier 2 level they indirectly use, all of which happen to be in the same part of China.""The waters get murkier,"" said Brian Alster, general manager of third-party risk and compliance for Dun & Bradstreet. Plus, China's impact on the world's commerce has grown. ""When you look at SARS outbreak in 2003, they were 2% of global GDP,"" Alster said. ""Today they're 20%.""Already feeling the impact, according to the study, are the automobile and electronics industries, which face the largest first quarter effects on earnings. Then come retail and financial services, followed by total services, with a heavy emphasis on disrupted tourism.""We have seen reports of customers paying air freight to get the parts out of there at a substantially increased cost,"" said Ann Marie Uetz, a partner with Foley & Lardner and co-chair of the law firm’s national automotive crisis response team. ""But we haven't seen lines shutting down here in North America."" Auto manufacturers are doing what they must to keep producing their most profitable vehicles. ""To be blunt, I think GM is going to keep building trucks—the Silverado in particular,"" she said.Doing what is necessary can result in big spending. ""A lot of times [manufacturers are] working on 5% or 10% margins,"" said Richard Lebovitz, CEO of LeanDNA, which provides supply chain management services to large companies in the aerospace, automotive, and industrial controls sectors. Air freighting parts in gets expensive. ""You could be adding a cost of parts of 10% to 30% in some cases,"" Levovitz said. That can become a big bottom-line hit.But the alternative is worse. Stop production and a company could lose customers. Like BT epoxy resin, it only takes a single automobile panel or one industrial motor to keep a product from shipping. Because increasingly work has become custom, rather than using off-the-shelf parts, finding an alternative source may be at best costly and at worst nearly impossible.""The tooling [to make the part] could be in the $10,000 range, but it could be in the several hundred-thousand-dollar range"" for larger items, Lebovitz said.Beyond customer loss, a factory shutdown has another long-term implication. A company can easily stop production. Restarting, though, means reengaging the entire supply chain and getting it to work again on all the necessary components. The participating companies likely have shifted attention elsewhere to keep their own revenue streams alive.While there is concern now, the great unknown is how long the situation in China could last. Some manufacturers and their suppliers have more options than others. ""If you're a Fortune 50 or Fortune 100, you're going to have a lot of resources to identify and mitigate risk,"" Nelson said.On the other hand, corporations in the bottom half of the Fortune 1000—which individually still have billions in annual revenue—frequently run with less inventory and more reliance on components, ingredients, and products arriving only when needed. That could mean having ""only 30 to 40 days of materials on hand,"" Nelson said. Anticipation of the lunar new year probably meant that companies had already laid in additional inventory because of planned shutdowns, adding perhaps two more weeks of production capacity.""Another month beyond that you're going to see some of the companies having issues,"" Nelson said.",94% of the Fortune 1000 are seeing coronavirus supply chain disruptions: Report,2020-02-21 09:54:01,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7ethg/94_of_the_fortune_1000_are_seeing_coronavirus/

Ten other passengers from the Diamond Princess tested positive in Japan, but are not being counted among the infected yet, because the tests have not been confirmed by the C.D.C. However, they will likely be added to the case count, Dr. Messonnier said.Several Americans remain critically ill with the infection in Japanese hospitals. They were among the passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was overwhelmed with infections after it docked in Yokahama, Japan.As of Friday, the coronavirus has infected 75,000 people, the vast majority in mainland China, and has killed 2,236.“This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat,” Dr. Messonnier said.Please check back for updates on this developing story..","Coronavirus Cases in the United States Reach 34, and More Are Expected",2020-02-21 10:13:45,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7f4ax/coronavirus_cases_in_the_united_states_reach_34/

fib57zu,-0.7105,-0.296,"You may recall from intro to psychology that people behave in irrational ways. Prone to bystander effect and herd behavior.For example go to a public place with a few friends, and have three of them stare up in the are and occasionally point. Watch how many pedestrians walking by will also look up and copy that behavior. Herd response is a powerful force.What happens when that herd response is that nothing is amiss, despite evidence of the contrary? There's a gunman walking around the parking lot. But since that's outside the norm of every day expectation you see shoppers going about their business without missing a step until a few people take clearly visible action or emergency response crews pour in.This is where snapping people out of their herd mentality comes in during an emergency event. ""Someone help"" will not lead to response. Directly point to a person, ask their name, and tell THEM to get help.As long as everyone goes about their day it's easy to have the excuse to take less action. Only when the discomfort of inaction exceeds discomfort of action do well worn routines get changed.You can't save the world. Preparedness is an area where it's okay to be selfish.

fib682o,-0.9868,-0.296," I don't know how to get rid of the wall. rip. anyway, here:""Why the Coronavirus (official name: COVID-19) is not something we should be blowing off: Something that [allegedly started in a Wuhan seafood market ](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-coronavirus)has now affected 75k+ people worldwide (these are **confirmed** cases), began in December and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon, and has now started to impact the economy. For a worldwide overview, [check this bad boy out](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html?fbclid=IwAR1xqib94jDzPGgncqgpsA-uyKx2nu7-FMH1LNUR8VG3UAJtBtqQ8ihiCAc#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).Everything here has a source that I’ve included — it is not being pulled out of my paranoid ass. I think it’s important for us to be aware, as even though young whippersnappers such as myself (and possibly you, the reader), might not be at risk as much as others, it **still could affect people we know**. This novel virus is more likely to [affect males and the older populous](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/health/coronavirus-men-women.html) — but this doesn’t mean you should act like you’re immune.It’s currently confirmed that it has a higher fatality rate than the flu\*, so we can flush that weak ass fact down the shitter — it’s time to take this bat(shit crazy) flu seriously. Please inform yourselves — **the time is now**.\*[2.3% vs 0.1%](https://abc7news.com/5945128/) Please note: This source thinks that the flu is not more deadly, because they’re **assuming** that not all cases are being counted; however, it’s also **assumed** that China is lying about the numbers and silencing any people that are trying to warn people about what’s happening in China. ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/business/china-coronavirus-doctor-death.html))I know we think that this has not *really* reached us in the US yet, but we might want to think again. The former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has stated that Coronavirus might be spreading undetected in our country. (This [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aDzdklYEkQ) is a YouTube video, FYI.)  The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also tweeted on February 21st that the virus is a “tremendous public health threat.” ([Source](https://twitter.com/BNODesk/status/1230907665846611973?s=20))A sign we should start taking this seriously? I think so.Unfortunately, here’s how not seriously people are taking this: Frank King, an Oregon comedian, was on the MS Westerdam, a cruise ship that contained a woman who tested positive for the novel virus. [This moron](https://speakwellbeing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/FrankKing-HS.jpg) was put up in a fucking 5-star hotel and snuck out because [he didn’t want to miss work.](https://www.kptv.com/news/oregon-comedian-breaks-quarantine-flies-back-home/article_cb431a52-52af-11ea-9c13-f72de419c6d9.html) He’s been fired — but he’s in Eugene, so who knows who he’s spreading it to just because he said he wasn’t symptomatic. ([He’s now claiming that he was cleared by the CDC](https://www.newsweek.com/comedian-coronavirus-quarantine-fired-cruise-line-1488069).)Bright side: Co2 emissions have been reduced by over 25% (up to 40%) in China, which is about 6% of global emissions. However, if the Politburo (Executive committee of the Communist Party of China: CPC) make up for this through “active” stimulus in speeding up construction projects (and therefore making more construction materials with the Co2 intensive process), then it might result in an overall increase of Co2 emissions after this is all over. (Disclaimer: I’m not sure I understood any of that — so just check out the [source](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-has-temporarily-reduced-chinas-co2-emissions-by-a-quarter).)What the US should be doing right now is what Russia is doing: implementing a ban of Chinese nationals from entering the country to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. ([Source](https://www.boston25news.com/news/world/russia-soon-ban/QDPIK7TS2OVILGSHD7OFUI3PBE/)) Unfortunately, Donald Trump is too busy firing people in the aftermath of being “betrayed” by Mitt Romney who used his right to vote freely to “go against his own party.” So yeah, I’m not sure why anyone would take this seriously when our president is busy focused on making his ego feel better. After all, the death tollonly just broke 2200 — that’s child’s play, especially when you think about them as a statistic, rather than real people who had lives and loved ones. (That’s sarcasm, by the way.) [Source for death toll](https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-19-20-intl-hnk/index.html).But, as a Reddit user put it, “No one wants to go to Russia anyway,” so we’d probably have more to worry about even if we implemented a similar ban. But, also [this](https://i.redd.it/zybwpaetuez31.png).Going back to the virus spreading undetected in the country, there has been a sudden announcement of [700+ people in Washington under health supervision](https://www.krem.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/over-700-people-in-washington-under-public-health-supervision-due-to-coronavirus/293-0f7dfced-db4f-4a3c-a2ff-73a7db258dd3) due to Coronavirus. And now, there are 5,400 people in California that are being asked to self-quarantine, alone with hundreds of others in Illinois, Georgia, New York, Washington, and “other states.” Fun that they don’t mention those, as you would think that it’s relevant to us in the US, but okay. ([Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-has-u-s-cities-stretching-to-monitor-self-quarantined-americans-11582108203), [Non-paywalled source](https://archive.is/9feG5))Fun fact: Florida’s health department refuses to share details on testing and quarantines because of “privacy concerns.” [Okay, Florida.](https://media.giphy.com/media/smfU85ajyxFaU/giphy.gif)What the US is also not doing is preparing as much as they should be. There are people on Reddit giving accounts of their experience in the healthcare field, and from what it sounds like, they are not preparing as much as they should with a potential pandemic. These are people from Reddit, so take the accounts with a grain of salt (but perhaps a little more in this situation — better to be safe than sorry). Unfortunately, there are still nurses who aren’t worried and are claiming that the flu is more deadly. Even if that were true, that should not be a reason to dismiss any of this, as from what we’ve seen so far, the virus is incredibly contagious, and its complication still pose a threat as it spreads outside of [China](https://external-preview.redd.it/0buY5Qv2EbD3z-iPYKvJ_6mx3IB_ApwQVgGQ5ax_4Jw.gif?format=mp4&s=5b7f49833e466e1ec4ebd16e7cf52cb8d392f574).

fib68i6,-0.9826,-0.296,"What does this mean for us? After all, most of the cases are in China — so far.I’m glad you asked. Top companies such as Apple, Starbucks, Nike, and Disney are all seeing drops in profit. Stores have been closed in China, and Apple will not be meeting its projected revenue for this quarter. Parents cannot meet children they’ve adopted, as orphanages in China are not allowing visitors — not to mention the “Do Not Travel” advisory that is in effect. The most disheartening effect of the virus is the now-blatant racism and xenophobia. Restaurants in foreign countries are posting “No Chinese” outside their businesses, newspapers are publishing pictures of Chinese people in masks with the phrase “Yellow Alert,” and Chinese restaurants in Australia, Canada, and the US are experiencing a decline in business due to fear of the virus. ([Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/19/world/coronavirus-unexpected-effects-trnd/index.html))  Yeah, I’m afraid of getting it too, but there’s a way to avoid it rather than going around and screaming you’re a racist. (It’s called stay inside and don’t interact with people because you’re a piece of shit.) Also? Russia is handling it without being racist by saying no Chinese **nationals**. They’re specifically prohibiting people coming to the country through China’s border or air travel, not shunning the fucking American-born Chinese college kid who’s visiting Siberia.Going back to global effect, shelves might start to empty in major US chain stores if this continues. Target, Best Buy, and Walmart are all at risk to be affected — and that’s only to name a few. If they begin to run out of the raw materials from China, which is looking likely come April, these major stores will start drying up. So stock up while you can — just saying. Because if companies in China can’t pay their employees because of the economic impact and are telling employees to use their paid vacation time and get ready for unpaid leave, we’re likely to be affected as well with how much shit comes from China. I’ve already seen a couple of people on Reddit talking about how they’ve lost their job at small businesses in the US because their supplies from China have dried up. No, we’re not looking at recession just yet, but it’s possible if the numbers of the virus continue to grow globally and spark lock-downs and quarantines. ([Source](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/02/12/target-best-buy-coronavirus-supply-disruption/41223461/), [another source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-19/chinese-companies-say-they-can-t-afford-to-pay-workers-right-now), also this is a fun [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f44e2s/if_youre_worried_about_the_virus_itself_youre/))Let’s move on.How is it spread? Pretty much like any other virus: the air (coughing and sneezing), close contact\* (shaking hands), or touching a surface where the virus is present, then touching your face. Also, poop. Sorry — fecal contamination. And even though you may not be [Robin Williams in RV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHgRmR024BE), it’s possible that fecal transmission is playing a part in this outbreak, as diarrhea is a symptom of Coronavirus. ([Source](https://fortune.com/2020/02/20/coronavirus-fecal-transmission/))  No, I’m not saying you’re touching other people’s poop — ew — , but did you know that poop particles fly in the air when you flush the toilet? [Gross.](https://www.self.com/story/toilet-plume-poop-spray) But more importantly, this means that if someone took a recent dump in a public restroom, that could put others at risk.\*Please note that close contact is considered within 6 feet of another person.Scientists are unsure of how long it will stay active on a surface — it’s estimated anywhere from 48 hours to 9 days. So basically, bleach everything, as disinfecting surfaces can change this. Wash your hands if you’re out in public. Use hand-sanitizer. ([Source](https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-just-how-long-coronaviruses-can-stick-around-on-a-surface))People with Coronavirus are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic; however, it is suspected that spread is possible even before someone shows symptoms. So you could be spreading it right now and not even know — lucky you!The incubation period is estimated to be anywhere from 1–14 days.Symptoms include:Persistent dry cough, nausea, vomiting, fever, shortness of breath, weakness, muscle aches, headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, and stomach pain. See the symptom progression in the first US case [here](https://www.nejm.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/0/nejm.ahead-of-print/nejmoa2001191/20200131/images/img_xlarge/nejmoa2001191_f2.jpeg).Complications that can surface in extreme cases include pneumonia (in both lungs), kidney failure, and death. In cases where people develop pneumonia, it’s been so severe they require breathing assistance. Those who have died from Coronavirus generally developed pneumonia, pleurisy, and then death. (This is mostly with older people who have prior complications such as diabetes, heart disease, etc.) Some cases of people who recover include long-term damage to the kidneys/testes. This is just some patients — not all.(All things sickness [source](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019))To end on a good note: So far, there is not evidence that supports the idea that your pets can catch the novel virus. The source suggests not to engage with your pets if you do have it, as it’s still fairly new (and everyone in Wuhan was releasing their pets because they couldn’t take care of them), but so far, you should not have to worry about your lil bbs.

This bulletin was sent to ARES members today regarding the mask shortage due to Corona Virus concerns. It provides a view into the procedures hospitals use to order critical supplies when local resources are insufficient. ""The worldwide Coronavirus scare has led to a critical shortage of hospital sterile face masks at all LA County hospitals (pediatric masks also at Children’s), and in all counties in California. Our hospitals have followed an orderly procedure that has led, this week, to a proposed State of Emergency declaration on Gov. Newsom’s desk. I thought it would be a teachable moment to document how our hospitals follow procedure in this unusual and widespread Resource Request.The first line of defense at the hospital level is to make a Resource request of the many Disaster Resource Centers through our friends at the LA County MAC:  [http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1005184_DRCBrochure2015.pdf](http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1005184_DRCBrochure2015.pdf)DRCs are supply storage centers and require MAC-level County authorization to dispatch a supply. In the case of the masks, the supply was exhausted everywhere at all DRCs.When the County can’t solve a Resource Request, they begin to follow FEMA procedure under the National Incident Command System (NIMS): [https://www.fema.gov/resource-management-mutual-aid](https://www.fema.gov/resource-management-mutual-aid)And when the State has no method to resolve a Resource Request, the Governor may declare a State of Emergency which then bumps the Resource Request to the Federal Government:  [https://www.fema.gov/disaster-declaration-process#wcm-survey-target-id](https://www.fema.gov/disaster-declaration-process#wcm-survey-target-id)And that’s where we’re at today with hospital face masks in the entire state. No doubt the Disaster Declaration will make major news soon.ARES encourages all members really interested in emergency communications to study up on many FEMA procedures. A free series of Independent Study (IS) courses are available to you online:  [https://training.fema.gov/is/](https://training.fema.gov/is/)ARES suggests FEMA NIMS/ICS courses IS-100, 200, 700, 800, with IS-300 and 400 for higher levels are all encouraged.""","U.S. Hospitals Now Rationing Personal Protection Equipment; Facing ""Potentially Severe"" Shortage of Surgical Masks",2020-02-21 13:41:38,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7i7sl/us_hospitals_now_rationing_personal_protection/

Japan, whose economy had already been teetering, is facing a possible recession. Oxford Economics said in a new report that, in a worst-case scenario, the outbreak could cut $1.1 trillion in global output.If the coronavirus crisis is anything like the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s, it could eliminate $29 billion in global airline revenue this year, resulting in a small industry contraction, the International Air Transport Association said on Thursday. The vast majority of the losses would be concentrated among airlines in the Asia-Pacific region, it said.The SARS outbreak wiped out about $6 billion in annual revenue for airlines in that part of the world and it took nine months for international passenger traffic to recover, the association said last month. But the coronavirus has so far proved more lethal, more widespread and more damaging to flight traffic in China, which today plays a far bigger role in global travel than it did two decades ago.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/21/business/coronavirus-airline-travel.html","Interactive graphic: 13,000 missing flights:The Global Consequences of the Coronavirus -NYTimes-02-21-2020",2020-02-21 13:56:30,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7ifmq/interactive_graphic_13000_missing_flightsthe/

The fact that the tests are so hit or miss, taken with the reports that the chinese are sending people home at the first sign of improvement, even if they are still worse than when they came in. Along with reports that the virus can remain in the system at testable levels well after recovery... It's pretty safe to assume that these are people who were never recovered in the first place, and or possibly mostly recovered people developing secondary infections etc while still testing positive for the virus. Assuming OC that feeling sick or getting sicker is what even caused their testing in the first place, and it wasn't just testing positive again. As i've said before:>I find it really hard to believe that resistance could be reduced to sub-immunity levels in the time frame of even this outbreak as a whole, let alone within it. I mean T and B-cells and antibodies should still be flooding the body for at least a week or more after infection.

It's going to spread everywhere and containment efforts will, at best, only slow it down.It's going to overwhelm the healthcare system everywhere, from the US to India to Africa, because of how many people will need care to survive.  Millions of people will die, but your odds of catching it and having only mild flu-like symptoms are tremendously in your favor unless you are over the age of 60.  The older you are, the worse your risk of mortality is.  Men, smokers and diabetics are all in additional-risk categories.Having a catastrophically overwhelmed healthcare system won't be good for anyone else with a serious injury, disease or disability.  It's gonna be hard to get treatment for anything for a year or more after this thing hits 50% of the population.Regardless, the world will go on, and many/most of us will survive.  It's possible that the overall mortality rate will be only 2% or so, but that's still over 100 million people worldwide (if 2/3 of us end up getting infected), so that's gonna leave a mark.The economic impact will be severe and long-lasting, as this is a true ""black swan"" event.  It may end up being a tremendous wake-up call for the world that having a global supply chain centered in China probably isn't/shouldn't be an acceptable single point of failure.  It's possible that some governments around the world will fall, and that stock markets could crash and banking/finance systems collapse.  Things could be unstable and chaotic for the next 4-5 years, and at the least, this pandemic will significantly change the course of history for the world. All that said, keep living your life.  Prepare the best way you see possible, but don't let anxiety or panic rule your mind.  Keep a clear head and ensure that you have as many realistic options as possible should things turn out worse than hoped, while not panicking and putting yourself in a shitty situation when it's not yet warranted.  Stay flexible mentally and work to preserve your access to useful information.  Draw upon communities, both local and online, to build your knowledge and preserve access to valid news/information. This could be a lot worse.  Hopefully, we're given this opportunity to get our shit together, globally, as a species, with a 2% mortality rate instead of something that's dramatically more fatal but equally as contagious/easily transmitted.",Is the situation getting better or worse?,2020-02-21 14:14:41,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7ipg4/is_the_situation_getting_better_or_worse/

fibng47,-0.9149,-0.5994,I'm taking this death in Italy and the very sudden two deaths in Iran as a sign that the virus is both widespread and mild. Why? For all of the international cases that were confirmed over the past month very few of them died. Now we're hearing about new cases and then BOOM some of them are dead and quite a few of them are in critical care. Why?I believe the reason is: those original international cases were linked directly to China so people knew to be aware of symptoms and to report themselves to medical facilities. In Italy and Iran what we likely have is widespread mild cases that are going completely undetected until a few serious cases pop up. It would not surprise me at all if we hear of new cases pop up in various other countries which then quickly result in deaths. We shouldn't automatically assume that the virus is suddenly more dangerous but we should take that to mean it's widespread in that area. I am in no way an expert - just putting two and two together.

When they arrived in Belgium, they made use of public transport to get home.Edit: source is this article and video from said local news crew, published by the Flemish national broadcast service VRT. https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/02/20/herenthout-thuis-quarantaine-corona/","""We made up the story that we were clear"" -video of US Diamond Princess evacuee who got on repatriation flight before knowing test results, then got sick while flying .....",2020-02-21 15:02:18,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7jern/we_made_up_the_story_that_we_were_clear_video_of/

Protocol with novel agents is to treat it as such, even when transmission routes are not entirely understood. Please seek /u/SecretAgentIceBat if you have further questions. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia, connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases from Wuhan, China. Genetic analysis revealed that it is closely related to SARS-CoV and genetically clusters within the genus Betacoronavirus, forming a distinct clade in lineage B of the subgenus Sarbecovirus together with two bat-derived SARS-like strains. The origin of the virus is not clear yet. Similar to SARS-CoV, a recent study confirmed that Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2), a membrane exopeptidase, is the receptor used by 2019-nCoV for entry into the human cells.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15018127](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15018127)",How COVID-19 Is Spread - Not Airborne - Highly informative article,2020-02-21 15:40:18,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7jy4e/how_covid19_is_spread_not_airborne_highly/

fibsw72,0.905,0.0,"> Another potential mode of viral spread, airborne transmission, was discussed by a Shanghai official in early February. When airborne, infective virus can drift through the air as an aerosol. In this form of transmission, “very small droplets that come out of our mouth very quickly evaporate the water off, and we’re left with a gel kind of material . . . that forms a bit of a protective environment for those virions to survive for longer,” Mackay explains. This is distinct from droplet-based spread of the virus.> > Viruses such as measles that do show airborne transmission can spread further than viruses transmitted in respiratory droplets. But Mackay says that there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is spread through airborne transmission. Within 24 hours of the Shanghai official’s comments, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention had put out a statement emphasizing that there was no indication that SARS-CoV-2 is spread in this way.> > It’s possible, though not very likely for the time being, that SARS-CoV-2 will adopt a new mode of transmission as it evolves, Mackay says. “A change in mode of transmission is a big deal for a virus,” he says. “It’s a bit like growing an extra arm for us, or another eye.”> > Given the ease with which it’s currently spreading via respiratory droplets, he adds, “at the moment, I don’t think the virus really needs to adapt too much further to its ability to transmit from human to human.

Just because something quarantined in a negative air room does not mean it is airborne.In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia, connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases from Wuhan, China. Genetic analysis revealed that it is closely related to SARS-CoV and genetically clusters within the genus Betacoronavirus, forming a distinct clade in lineage B of the subgenus Sarbecovirus together with two bat-derived SARS-like strains. The origin of the virus is not clear yet. Similar to SARS-CoV, a recent study confirmed that Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2), a membrane exopeptidase, is the receptor used by 2019-nCoV for entry into the human cells.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15018127](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15018127)","Stanford Hospital to treat COVID-19 as airborne, negative pressure room required.

Beijing responded by suspending broadcasts of NBA games and effectively permitting a boycott of the association in China. On February 5, however, the Chinese consul general in New York was offering the NBA his heartfelt thanks.“While China is bravely fighting the virus, people from the United States and all over the world are offering massive support in preventing and controlling this outbreak,” consul general Huang Ping said during a media briefing, reportedly loading special thanks on the NBA, which has donated $1.4 million in cash and supplies to charities in Hubei province, where the outbreak began.In doing so, the NBA has joined the ranks of billionaires, businesses, celebrities, and philanthropists that have promised donations to help combat the coronavirus. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged $100 million in support; Alibaba founder Jack Ma has committed $14.4 million from his own charity; meanwhile, Boeing has shipped 250,000 masks to frontline staff.But not all of these donations are going to China, and of the resources that are, not all are ending up where they need to be.Go, NGOs, goOn January 26, the Ministry of Civil Affairs announced that all donations being made to support efforts to contain the coronavirus should be directed through one of five government-affiliated charities, including the Hubei Provincial Red Cross and the Wuhan Municipal Red Cross—two subsidiaries of the Red Cross Association of China.But the Red Cross of China is not like the Red Cross overseas, which operates as a non-government agency (NGO). The Red Cross Association of China is what Beijing calls—with no sense of irony—a government-organized non-government organization, or GONGO.“GONGOs are usually set up by the government to channel international funding and absorb government officials who were laid off during administrative reform in the 1990s. They are either spin-offs of government-affiliated service organizations or direct creations of government agencies, and are often led by retired government officials,” said Li Hui, assistant professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong.Deploying former officials to the world of GONGOs gives the government a direct line to their activities, and the former bureaucrats are expected to be more attune to the ambitions and policies of the Party than their civic counterparts.The ruling China Communist Party prefers GONGOs over independent civic NGOs, Li said, which still exist but are regarded with suspicion by officials who view them as a threat or, at the very least, an interference to Party control.Foreign NGOs are even less welcome. In 2017, the central government introduced a law requiring foreign NGOs, including those registered in Hong Kong or Taiwan, to find a government sponsor before registering as an NGO. The law also brought foreign NGOs under direct supervision of the Public Security Bureaus—China's police—which are able to inspect an NGO’s finances, staff roster, and office facilities.“On the one hand, some officials believe that NGOs can help support service delivery and resolve social conflicts and are open to collaborate with NGOs in providing social services to citizens. On the other hand, the government has devised various policy tools to formally and informally restrict NGOs’ ability to register, raise revenue, and engage in political activities,” Li says. “The political space afforded to NGOs has been tightening.”Show me the moneyThe Wuhan Red Cross—the GONGO located in the city at the center of the coronavirus epidemic—had received over $86 million in cash donations from the public as of February 1, according to a local government official. It's also gotten stockpiles of supplies, including over 9,000 masks, 64,000 protective suits, and more than 80,000 pairs of goggles. But on social media, frontline medical staff complain that the supplies aren’t being passed along.""We appreciate all donations from society; and in order to make sure all supplies go to the most needed, we have decided to accept donations ourselves without working with the Red Cross,"" said Song Zhan, the donation coordination officer for Huoshenshan Hospital, the temporary field hospital built in eight days to accommodate the overflow of patients.The Red Cross has said there are legitimate reasons why supplies haven’t been forwarded to the frontlines, such as donations of masks that are unsuitable for medical use. On February 1, however, three officials from the Hubei Red Cross were reprimanded for “mishandling donations for the coronavirus,” prompting an apology from the organization.This isn’t the first time the Red Cross of China has had to apologize for mishandling resources during a crisis. When an earthquake struck Sichuan province in 2008 and killed 69,000 people, the government appointed the Red Cross as the go-to charity for handling donations and relief efforts. A report from Tsinghua University in 2009 estimated that 80% of collected donations were funnelled straight into government coffers as “extra revenue.”Side stepThe shortcomings of China’s GONGOs might be why some altruists are deciding to make indirect contributions to the coronavirus crisis.Of the $100 million pledged by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, $20 million is going to multilateral agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), while $60 million is earmarked for vaccine research. The $14.4 million pledged by the Jack Ma Foundation will primarily fund vaccine research, too.“It is exciting to see that individuals, foundations, and corporations are donating money and supplies to help those affected by the coronavirus,” Li said, “But the crises clearly show that the government and the broader society should work collectively to explore ways to sustain the newly emerged donation culture and support the growth of civic NGOs.”NGOs are far from perfect—just look at the Red Cross in Haiti. But in funneling donations to government-backed charities, China is staking some of its response to the coronavirus crisis on a system mired in the same bureaucracy that stymied its initial response to the outbreak.",China's coronavirus is attracting billionaire donations—where is the money going?,2020-02-21 20:39:50,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7no6t/chinas_coronavirus_is_attracting_billionaire/
