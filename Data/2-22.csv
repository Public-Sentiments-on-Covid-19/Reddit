So I think that counts as ""evidence"" for a 14 day quarantine period. Of course, that suggests there is a 2.5% chance it has a longer incubation, but all things considered that seems like a reasonable risk to take (longer quarantined would have severe negative effects for not much benefit, the healthcare system can handle the odd one that slips through the cracks if people are aware). Considering the article in the OP though, I guess there is a small chance this person was part of the ""2.5%"" and had a super long incubation (probably 0.01% chance or something for an incubation of this length, rare but possible).

fidwfdb,-0.9744,-0.296,"Hi there.I currently live in Sri Lanka. Relatively speaking we live fairly close, in fairly similar geographic areas and even levels of competence in healthcare management. Sri Lanka has only reported a single case right at the outbreak of the virus, last month. A Chinese tourist.Now I cannot speak on Kerala, but I will speculate why Sri Lanka has such low numbers despite having very many Chinese workers and travellers. Maybe there are similar reasons in Kerala.**Hypothesis 1: Warmth/Heat limits spread of virus.**Unlike Singapore, Sri Lanka (and Kerala) does not have as much of a prevalence of AC. If heat kills the virus faster, spread through fomites (infected touches something, that thing then can pass on the virus) is far far less likely. If it can stay on surfaces in cooler temperatures longer, it’s chance of spreading is much higher. **Hypothesis 2: Chinese travellers/workers are fairly isolated in their own communities/travel groups**No Sri Lankan has gotten the virus yet, officially at least. This may be because the Chinese community is fairly isolated and mingle mainly with themselves. Even Chinese tourists mainly travel among themselves, with the exposure to others in the tourist industry fairly limited. As such, the risk of transmission from Chinese to Sri Lankan, and then further communal spread, is limited. This may be true too in Kerala and India in general.**Hypothesis 3: The virus has spread, and we will only know once the first death is announced**Sri Lanka is highly beholden to China, and needs good relations with them. They will not take actions or even expressions that may jeopardise their relationship with China. It is possible that the virus is spreading communally, and it is not being tested for. It will only be when sufficient pressure is put on the healthcare system that cases will be uncovered, like in Iran or Japan. Where further spread was discovered through deaths. I personally wouldn’t be surprised to see the headline of the first death to coronavirus in Sri Lanka, followed by many, many more cases being uncovered.","Update from Kerala, India.

fif9oxb,0.9455,0.0,"Since hurricane María, Puerto Rican culture has been one of prepping because we know we need to survive disasters on our own. We are also an island surrounded by “big water”, so if ports are on lockdown, we suffer big time and we know it from experience. Since the earthquakes, we modified our hurricane prep to include earthquake prep (whistles and such.)Now I did some slight modifications to the above for pandemics (more medicines and items for cleaning and hygiene.)I think the best reason to prep now is to be ahead of the inevitable panic buying. You may legitimately need Tylenol, lysol, alcohol or whatever (not for COVID-19), but be unable to find it easily a few weeks from now - or if you find it, it may be rationed. Trade has been affected, needed items are being bought by the tons in Asia, including being shipped from the USA. I know what empty shelves at stores for MONTHS looks like. Last tip: if you want to be savvy in your prepping, prep from the start with actual survival gear. Buy food that is shelf stable for decades; buy hand crank flashlights and radios and crank them every couple of months; buy solar chargers and keep them at the ready; buy water filters and purifiers, etc. Don’t depend on batteries; don’t depend on having to buy water; don’t depend on having to rebuy every single prep item in 1-2 years. Some will have to be replaced, but if you’re savvy you can save money in the long run, by prepping with items that need less replacing.

Having worked disaster relief as a paramedic for hurricanes in the US and in Honduras, shelter for us in the US was usually the floor in the fire station or the ambulance or rescue truck we were working on. The scale of my experience is so small compared to what is really a disaster location in Wuhan that I imagine healthcare workers are sleeping whenever and wherever they can. The fatigue is so heavily compounded when you have no true rest. I experienced that in Honduras because the heat and bugs would bother you when you tried to sleep that when you went back on duty I was still tired. Sometimes you get too tired to be hungry and then you are in trouble. Again, my experience was probably less than 1% of what these poor relief workers are facing and I never had to do it more than 2 weeks before rotation out.","China brings in seven cruise ships to house Wuhan medical workers, state media reports",2020-02-22 04:49:41,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7s4y9/china_brings_in_seven_cruise_ships_to_house_wuhan/

The early measures taken have an effect to have more control over the situation as time goes by. * Basic timeline of measures Singapore took:   * On 27 Jan, contact tracing for all 2000 travellers from Hubei province that was already in Singapore was implemented to identify potential risks and quarantine measures. All new travellers from Hubei province will undergo compulsory quarantine. ( [Link](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/additionary-precautionary-measures-to-minimise-risk-of-community-spread-in-singapore---28-jan-2020.pdf) )   At this point of time, when in Jan, all teachers/students/healthcare/eldercare sectors with travel history to China in the last 14 days are all subjected to compulsory leave of absence for 14 days  ([Link](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/wuhan-virus-singapore-to-impose-14-days-leave-of-absence-for-those-in-schools-healthcare)).   Also on this day, all pneumonia patients in public hospitals in Singapore are being tested for COVID-19. ([Link](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/all-pneumonia-patients-in-public-hospitals-here-being-tested-for-coronavirus-moh))  **This on the onset already protect the schools and hospitals (lessons learnt from SARS)**.    * This was escalated on 31st Jan when WHO declare it a public health emergency on 30st Jan. Singapore has assessed that it is prudent to take additional pre-emptive measures at this stage.  From 1 February 2020, 2359h, all new visitors **(regardless of nationalities)** with recent travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days will not be allowed entry into Singapore, or to transit through Singapore. All visas be it to-be-issued, or issued will be suspended. Residents/Work Pass holders can enter but with compulsory quarantine.

([Link](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-coronavirus-singapore-loa-breach-work-pass-12413478)) This ensure the no one will ""chance"" the quarantine.   * On 7th Feb,  all work pass holders with travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days and planning to enter/return to Singapore after 2359 hours, 8 February 2020, will be required to obtain prior approval before they commence their journey. This is regardless of the nationality of the work pass holder. Penalty is heavy if they even arrived in SG without approval letter. ([Link](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2020/0207-new-requirements-for-employers-with-wph-returning-from-china))    * On 12th Feb, the government announced that it will foot bills of infected patients at public hospitals. (regardless of nationalities) This coverage does not extend to outpatient treatment at general practitioner clinics or polyclinics, nor does it apply to treatment sought at private medical facilities.   **So it effectively encourage people with symptoms to go forward to get tested in public hospitals, included non-citizens, tourists, etc. Aka flushing out potential suspected cases.** ([Link](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coronavirus-government-to-foot-bills-of-infected-patients-at-public-hospitals))* Guessed Singapore did not anticipate Church clusters, and there was a huge jump in the couple of days when the 2nd church clusters was discovered. With the discovery of Church cluster. The church community in Singapore also start to indefinitely suspend services. ([Link](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-catholic-church-to-suspend-mass-indefinitely-advises-events-to-be-suspended)) Most mega churches also start to turn to online services/mass. * True that Singapore is a small country, one city, and small land size compared to other countries. But it is a super densely populated city. Imagine \~6 million people squeezed on a land size that is 700+ square km (or about 270+ sq miles). Any potential community spread is serious.* All these early measures / testings / flushings help greatly to find and confirm potential confirmed cases *early*. **This is important because the earlier you find the infected, the less time they have to infect others.** * So there was a huge lead in Singapore confirmed numbers early on (think last week), when suspected cases are being flushed out. But with these people being isolated and treated, and all their close contacts being quarantined. They have no chance to infect others. So chances of further potential community spread are reduced.**And so, the number of confirmed cases in Singapore ""goes up slowly"" in relative to current S.Korea/Japan situation.** Hopefully with all these measures taken, there will not be a super spreader lurking around undetected in the community or on the streets of Singapore at the moment.","3 more confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore, 2 patients discharged",2020-02-22 04:57:17,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7s7j4/3_more_confirmed_covid19_cases_in_singapore_2/

fiem4uk,0.9591,0.0,"Full text:Two evacuees from the Diamond Princess who were quarantined at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland are infected with coronavirus, and health officials said they expect more cases among the cruise ship’s passengers in the coming days.So far, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed the COVID-19 virus in 18 people brought to the U.S. from the cruise ship. Two of them are among the 144 evacuees who came to Lackland on Monday for a two-week quarantine, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a call with reporters Friday.Despite aggressive efforts to contain the cases that already have surfaced in the country, Messonnier said “it’s very possible, even likely” that person-to-person transmission eventually will occur in the U.S.“This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat. We don’t yet have a vaccine for this novel virus, nor do we have a medicine to treat it specifically,” she said. “We may see poor outcomes in others, not just people who were on board the Diamond Princess, but among others who become sick with this virus.”Kate Grusich, a CDC spokeswoman, said the infected passengers in San Antonio had tested positive for the virus before they were evacuated from Japan, results that were confirmed by CDC after they arrived at Lackland. They have been isolated and are receiving medical treatment nearby, she said.At least a half-dozen of the cruise ship evacuees at Lackland were transported this week to hospitals for testing.The new diagnoses bring the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in San Antonio to three. All the infections affected evacuees who were quarantined at Lackland.Conditions on the Diamond Princess had grown increasingly grim as the ship docked at a port in Yokohama, Japan, for an attempted self-quarantine, after a passenger was found to be infected. In the ensuing days, it would become home to the highest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China, including more than 600 infections. Two elderly Japanese passengers have died.Several American passengers who are hospitalized in Japan are “seriously ill,” Messonnier said.In light of those circumstances, and the close contact the passengers had on board with so many infected people, Messonnier said, the evacuated Americans “are considered at high risk for infection.”The new cases include more than a dozen asymptomatic Diamond Princess passengers who unexpectedly tested positive for the virus as the State Department was in the process of evacuating 329 Americans from the cruise ship. A handful of the infected people traveled on the flight to Lackland but ultimately were taken to Nebraska for their treatment.Previously, coronavirus was diagnosed in an evacuee taken to Lackland from Wuhan, China, where the new pathogen first emerged.The evacuee still is hospitalized in San Antonio. The patient initially was treated at Methodist Hospital | Texsan but was transferred to another facility after improving, said Jennifer McQuiston, a captain in the U.S. Public Health Service who led the CDC’s quarantine of the Wuhan evacuees.It’s possible the evacuee, and the two other infected people, are under the care of the Texas Center for Infectious Disease, a state-run tuberculosis hospital in San Antonio that began treating an unspecified number of patients earlier this week. The hospital has set aside a separate 22-bed wing for people infected with the virus who are experiencing mild symptoms, as well as those who are suspected of having it.The patient from Wuhan will not be released until nose and mouth swabs test negative for the virus at least two days apart, McQuiston said in an interview.The other 90 Wuhan evacuees at Lackland were declared healthy and released at 9 a.m. Thursday, after a two-week quarantine at a hotel on the base.As their departure approached, McQuiston said the atmosphere grew jubilant. Tears flowed, music played and McQuiston exchanged hugs with each evacuee, sans protective gear.The group — which included many families and children who had also self-quarantined in Wuhan — was free to go outside for the first time in weeks.That outcome, McQuiston said, “proved that quarantine works.”“I have been so impressed with the resilience and the enthusiasm of our passenger group,” she said. “I’m so proud of them for coming through this.”However, McQuiston acknowledged several factors will complicate the still-ongoing quarantine of the Diamond Princess passengers.On the ship, the passengers had a higher degree of exposure to the virus than those who came from Wuhan. Many also are older and may have underlying medical conditions that make them more susceptible to complications from the virus.It’s also a much larger group that requires more federal resources, she said.Already, protocols for testing have shifted from one group to the other. Not all the Wuhan evacuees were tested for the virus, McQuiston said, but the CDC will swab any cruise ship passengers who want to be tested.With the Wuhan evacuees gone, McQuiston said she was headed home for a reprieve.The Diamond Princess evacuees at Lackland are being overseen by Rear Adm. Nancy Knight, a medical doctor who serves as director of the division of global health protection at the CDC. Knight had worked on the quarantine of nearly 200 people at March Air Reserve Base earlier this month and previously responded to infectious disease threats in other countries, including the HIV epidemic in South Africa.Local officials are having ongoing conversations with the agencies coordinating the quarantine at Lackland. Bruce Davidson, spokesman for Mayor Ron Nirenberg, said the mayor organized a meeting Friday morning with local, state and federal officials and hospital leaders to discuss a strategy for handling coronavirus cases.Earlier this week, Nirenberg and other officials in San Antonio had raised concerns about safety risks posed by transporting evacuees from Lackland to local hospitals. City and county officials have asked that evacuees be kept at the base until a diagnosis is confirmed, a request that’s still pending, Davidson said.","As San Antonio coronavirus cases grow to three, health officials expect more cases in cruise ship passengers",2020-02-22 05:58:55,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7suey/as_san_antonio_coronavirus_cases_grow_to_three/

All were born in a secret laboratory funded by Russia (and ran personally by comrade supreme Putin) in the Wuhan province of main China. The Wuhan market lab works in plain sight (except for comrade supreme Putin who hides in a garbage bin with the lid open enough for him to oversee everything) and numerous people from around the world come on their own free will to be experimented upon. They eat in the open bats, snakes, pockemon, Gremlins, spiders, etc. Alll of the above carry very dangerous viruses that can pass trough different species (the pockemon ones are especially nasty). The Corvid operatives 1-18 managed to infect a few people but then fizzled out. Comrad Corvid 19 was special, he managed to fool (with Russian designed propaganda) many innocent cells into making more copies of himself. Then he proceeded to infect with his nasty genetic disinformation people in many different countries.

(Trump is in the hospitality business, after all). Containment is part of mitigation. Mitigation requires gobs of cash.

Also there’s a few posters who post a lot who won’t admit they have a negative “doomer” slant who post articles with extremely sensationalized titles - no attempt to present the information in a neutral outlook. Lots of bad links to sketchy sites/shady YouTube vids, suddenly more links to posts on other subs (?) that are even sketchier. There’s A LOT of shitposting comments and even more “fuck China/who/ccp/we’re all doomed/so it begins” etc.    Between all those it’s become hard to get the actual good information.

The doom is already here as China has shutdown manufacturing.The US is wholly dependent on China for many prescriptions drugs including those shown to be effective in treating this disease. China has thousands of drug manufacturers, mostly small factories scattered across the nation. While China accounts for 70% of the market, the rest of the drug companies rely on them for raw materials for their own production.Does your drug contain acetominophen? China is the world's supplier. Do you take Vitamin C? China produces 90% of it. Tetracycline? 90%.In the early 2000s, China's government subsidized drug production, undercutting American manufacturers. So these big US corporations simply laid off workers and shifted production to the East.Johnson & Johnson cut close to 13k jobs, Pfizer laid off 2k researchers. GlaxoSmithKline has more than 2000 employees in China. All the big names are tied to China -- Roche, Novartis, Merck, Eli Lily and many more. So even if a big American drug company produces your meds, chances are good disruptions in the supply chain are going to cause problems.Millions of Americans could experience significant delays in getting their prescription drugs.And it's not just meds. China manufactures a number a drug related products like spray bottles or pumps. And some of the drugs aren't going to be manufactured elsewhere because China has exclusive manufacturing agreements for drugs for anesthesia, cancer and HIV/AIDS.Those that can be made elsewhere require Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (known as APIs).

The main two chemicals that are important are disinfectant (usually sodium hypochlorite aka bleach) and coagulant. There could be other stuff like permanganate, orthophosphate, and fluoride. I do know that a lot of bulk chemicals are manufactured in the US as it is often cheaper to do things that way than deal with shipping highly concentrated chemicals from overseas. It all depends on who the supplier sources chemicals from. The thing I would be more concerned with is if parts fail like piping, pumps, and electronics used to monitor and control the system. There's a lot of testing material that might be made overseas too like bottles for water samples and other lab equipment. Right now I haven't heard anything about shortages though. The biggest worry is if parts fail and replacements can't be sourced but I find that happening to be unlikely. Also, larger municipalities don't usually use disposable containers for chemicals.

Most maids abroad have accounts in Indonesian bank so their families in village can draw and use their salaries for daily life needs. These accounts, are usually handled by their agents. If they break the contract or run away, their family in Indonesia might suffer too as the agent could easily seize the money. We all here know it's like a slave industry. So really, coming back home for those maids are not as easy as you said.Edit: ooh I forgot that their passport is also usually held by their agents.",New case of coronavirus in Tokyo is a man who traveled to Indonesia while he was sick.

Integral to the success of any emergency planning strategy is 'surge capability', incorporating the ability to scale up the delivery of appropriate specialist care to those that require it [4]. Modelling of the impact of an influenza pandemic on UK critical care services has been carried out using the FluSurge 1.0 programme developed at the US Centers for Disease Control [5]. With simulation of an 8-week epidemic and 25% attack rate the demand for critical care beds from patients with influenza would **represent 208% of current combined level 2 (high-dependency unit) and level 3 (ICU) bed capacity, and 231% of current level 3 capacity [6]. Even allowing for optimistic estimates of other modulating factors (50% reduction in ICU demand with use of neuraminidase inhibitors and 50% upgrade of level 2 to level 3 beds), level 3 bed occupancy due to the pandemic would remain at 75%. Furthermore, occupancy of level 3 beds by 'flu patients' was unsustainable at approximately 50% in terms of care for other patients even in the most optimistic conditions.**It would crash the health care system.

My concern is that people are not educated well enough on what to do and how to prepare. We know that some people are nuts in general and to have it running 24/7 will create some walking dead panic scenario for some. Already saw articles about chinese/Asian people being attacked (which is sad) and running it 24/7 could be counterproductive. Thankful for Reddit :D but I am not defending their actions.

He's correct: there are a lot of stable patients, namely seniors waiting for long-term care beds, taking up hospital real estate. In the event of a pandemic we need to make risk and benefit decisions about who needs that space more and about whether those seniors could be relatively safely moved elsewhere.Moreover, stressed as our system may be, from a standing start we still have significantly more nurses, doctors, and probably pretty much all quantitative measures than the Chinese system, so we should be able to hold out a little bit longer.

And to be honest Wuhan was in such a bad state at the very beginning, that it was not possible to implement it as strictly as elsewhere. There is no point in following it in any other countries because other cities are less infected and more prepared.The lockdowns in other Chinese cities might work but I don't have a survey for the measures taken and don't know what's the infection state in each cities. For example my parents' and grandparents' cities have no enough medical supplies, but also only imported infections+small family clusters, so there are no neighborhood lockdown at all until days ago and it was only in some of the neighborhoods.

fij8xek,0.5726,0.2732,"I’m very happy about this subreddit because I feel I’ve passed the initial stage of pandemic panic as I’ve been following covid 19 since January. I cried, had severe anxiety attacks, and even my sister distanced herself from me because of my “negativity”. People are in denial. The second I saw this virus I knew in my heart I’d be affected even if it was thousands of miles away in China at that time. The warnings and the news being posted here ahead of time, has me in the stage of acceptance and adaptability at this point. Prepared as well for a whole month of food, and still going to be prepare some more if time allows it. I live in LA, so I know for a fact things will get very bad here. However, I feel more at peace. I feel very at peace with whatever comes my way - whether death or not everything will be okay. Made peace with my  parents probably dying since they both have underlying issues and are past 60. Made peace that I may die too since I have an autoimmune disease. I spoke to my mom today and she understood where I’m coming from. I just hope my other family can cope with this, and find wisdom in these dire times as well. Being spiritually centered is so important. Thank you for this post. 💜 All I tell people is to eat good, exercise, and keep living your life. Yes you will have to adapt. Yes this sucks. Yes you will see tough shit. But not all things are JUST darkness, because there is duality. There is light even in darkness. They are one and the same - as is life and death. We have to understand these principles fundamentally to adjust. Everything will be okay. The storm shall pass. It won’t be eternal. We don’t know when, but let’s ride it out.

fijbxf6,-0.9431,0.0,I think drug supply would be more of an immediate concern. There's a lot of people that rely on prescription medication to survive and having to go through this process would invariably be much more difficult for very specific and needed medication types. Most can eat applesauce or bread to keep living. Diabetics and others with specific medication requirements need more than the basics to survive for more than a few weeks. I see that as the bigger issue.Edit: Not to mention very dangerous. There's a reason pharmacology is a fairly well paying and high demand field. Because you can kill people really fast by handing out medication incorrectly. I wouldn't trust bulk shipments of food and medicine being handed out by *any* government flunkies to ever get to their proper destination efficiently or correctly in this the type of scenario.

fijggsm,-0.9952,0.0,"Interesting read, thank you. The food supply so far is still alright, there's enough food coming in. Some supermarkets are open and have plenty of supplies, but most of the times they are outside of the 小区, so people have to organize. One person will go buy stuff, other people send a list of items they want. Some delivery services are still partially working, such as 河马, but often the delivery guy has to find a hole in the fence to pass the bags. It's kind of a breach in quarantine, but there's often no better solution.It's a very unique situation, and it brings unique problems to people in Wuhan. Trivial problems can become big problems. I can think of a few other ""interesting"" problems that people are facing in Wuhan:    - Pets. Lots of people have pets. Lots of pets were thrown out in the streets at the beginning of quarantine, sadly. Lots of pet were left alone at home when people got stuck outside of Wuhan. There is going to be a lot of dead cats in apartments, I'm afraid. And for those who have pets and didn't throw them out (the majority of people, hopefully), getting cat food can be difficult. A simple taobao delivery can take up to two weeks.    - Bills. Especially gas. Most of the time, you can pay everything online, but not always. In a lot of buildings, you have a card plugged in you gas meter. When you run out of money on the card, you need to go to the local gas office to make a refill. That's not easy when said office is closed.    - Money. Of course. Lot of people are not getting paid. A lot! Companies are in a difficult situation, no doubts, but employees not getting paid are the real victims. Life in quarantine is not expensive, of course, but when you are living paycheck to paycheck...    - Health problems. There are thousands of pregnant women. Thousands of people with different health issues. People who need to go to the hospital. These days, it's nearly impossible, and it's dangerous. You can get your prescription meds delivered, if you find a way to do so, but again, not easy.     - Can't go out. If you are unlucky enough that someone infected lives in your building, the whole building is often locked down. Can't go out at all. Security people are in charge of delivering food to your building. You need to go downstairs to your building entrance to pick up food, hoping not to cross anyone in the elevator. There are a lot of fights, people from ""uninfected"" buildings are demanding that the ""infected"" buildings are locked down.    - Fixing shit. Say you phone breaks down, or your computer. Well, sucks for you.    But all in all, Wuhan is doing a good job, there is food, electricity, gas, water, internet for everyone, after one month of lock down!
