fijjuki,-0.736,-0.3182,I don’t think he wants dead American citizens per se but I also think he has very little to no regard for any science-based organization. That’s just based on what I’ve seen out of his administration the last four years he has been in charge. And there are numerous articles that discuss how he has slowly been cutting away at the budget for organizations such as the CDC the past few years. They also all make sense considering how terrible our response has been so far to this whole thing. We can’t seem to agree on what we should even do with the people coming back from the cruise. Thousands of people in California alone are told to just self-quarantine at home with little to no oversight. It’s pretty obvious there’s a complete lack of cohesion and any sort of organization in our response so far and there also seem to be an obvious lack in resources. My guess is the organizations are stretched super thin already and this thing has only just begun.,Trump continues trying to cut funding from programs that protect America from CoViD19 and other health threats.,2020-02-23 00:06:21,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f86nzr/trump_continues_trying_to_cut_funding_from/

The structure is designed to streamline to have clear lines of communication and decision making. We have EOC (Emergency Operations Center) activation for floods, earthquakes, tornadoes. What's partially driving people anxiety, including mine, is that lack of clear communications and lack of preparedness and urgency from public health. Many many organizations and employers look to public health on what decisions they themselves should make.

fikyvxv,-0.8119,-0.357,"Definitely. Arbidol - Umifenovir an Influenza Membrane Fusion Inhibitor. Being tested alone and with HIV drugs against  nCoV along with other antivirals that inhibit the metabolism of these drugs increasing exposure to (plasma drug levels/AUC) the antivirals under investigation for anti nCoV activity. Abidol - Trade name for the SNRI/Opioid Analgesic Tramadol HCl in some countries. Not particularly useful here although other stronger opioids have a role in those with respiratory failure who are expected to get worse or die via MOR activation induced respiratory depression. You won’t be able to breathe and I will feel like you’re drowning; you will panic and thrash. Suppression of the respiratory drive using strong opioid analgesics suppresses this effect allowing for a more peaceful death along with a definite role in helping people tolerate use of artificial ventilation when complete anaesthesia is unavailable or contraindicated. The principle of double effect is important here as in cases of respiratory failure and ECMO/respirator dependence for adequate oxygenation and significant pulmonary edema caused by nCoV in a clearly agitated and suffocating patient; death is sometimes expected but not certain; the very mechanisms by which opioid analgesics are particularly good at relieving this type of suffering are also the effects that can hasten progession to more severe lung disease, reduced oxygenation if not respirator/ECMO dependent or these interventions are not available due to high demand. The patient must fully understand that strong opioids will specifically and non specifically relieve their suffering via central depression of respiratory drive and  the effects that result in centrally acting analgesia that affects the entire body; but suppression of that respiratory drive can hasten death or induce it in those who otherwise wouldn’t have died if they had been able to tolerate the effects nCoV has on the lungs for longer without use of drugs that cause respiratory depression. In the sickest of patients, without the use of specific antiviral drugs; ECMO, prone therapy, opioids, antibiotics (if positive for MRSA and/or other HAIs are suspected) and basic supportive care (fluid resus, IV or NG feeding); CVVH in renal failure; all the mainstays of good ICU care for severe pneumonia are the best we can do to limit suffering and give the lungs the time they need to heal sufficiently to again provide adequate oxygenation. Some (few) people will receive experimental drug treatments, some people will receive ICU treatment but with the provision of ICU beds 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than available hospital beds, one will be lucky and be already suffering from severe disease to be considered for what will be a rapidly dwindling number of ICU beds with the appropriate staff and equipment to treat at that level. Evidence that early induction of Chloroquine and Remdesivir treatment before COVID-19 becomes ‘severe’ and for those already suffering from severe disease is being increasingly reported as disease modifying and effective. Without strong evidence that other antiviral drug treatments are effective, those two drugs and ICU care would be what I would hope to and be happy to consent to receive if infected with nCoV as of today.",Clinical analysis of Lopinavir and ritonavir and Abidol: no improvement in symptoms found,2020-02-23 00:41:09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f86y80/clinical_analysis_of_lopinavir_and_ritonavir_and/

She is in fact not a server, just a delivery person as stated in the the text of the article itself: >Officials in Ebetsu City in Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido say a woman found to be infected with the new coronavirus works at a local elementary school. She is responsible for delivering school lunches to classrooms.  To divide and to serve individual children is done by a team of the children in turn in each classroom, not in the communal lunchroom. At least it was the way that the municipal elementary school did in my days.  (Added): Believe or not, she couldn't directly and physically engage in serving lunch for individual lunch for 194 children (in total per a day) in different classrooms within 45-50 minutes lunch break of Japanese municipal school. It is also worth noticing that the municipal elementary school of Ebetsu City fortunately entrusts the cooking of the meal itself out of school (the municipal school lunch center, explicitly stating in Japanese original), not in the school so that she directly involved neither in the cooking itself nor in dividing the meal for individual classrooms (that had already done by the staff of the school lunch center). What she did together with her two colleagues was to receive the already cooked/ divided lunch in the school and then to delivery them to the classrooms in the cart. >At a news conference on Sunday, city officials said she wasn't involved in cooking the meals, which is done at a different location. They said she was wearing a white robe, facemask and gloves while at work.  So, this news itself was not so good, but not the worst as some posts in this thread afraid, I suppose.  ~~I also would like to complain NHK of a kind of miss-translation of the title.

fijuump,0.8761,-0.4939,"Most of that is true. But... I’ll explain further. This lady is a worker in the kitchen, hired by the school just like all the teachers, but in organizing the lunch delivery carts. She’s probably been there many years, too.The public schools, almost all of them are the same, have a specified “lunch room” where they organize the carts that are picked up and returned to the same designated area by the students after lunch on a daily basis. They each have a class designation on the side and depending on the layout of the school, there can be between 14 and 25 carts depending on whether it is JHS only or a combined JHS/SHS. Yes, the food is cooked off site and organized in the schools for distribution. The workers in the kitchens organize the arrangement of the trays. It’s all very militarized and regimented. These carts are taken up elevators to classrooms by two students and the food trays are distributed by these “head and deputy head” students. The same students then return the cart to the delivery room.This is VERY different from what some of you might be thinking. The meals are NOT delivered from outside like an UberEats. They are prepared offsite and delivered onsite - handled by kitchen staff and then students. So, it’s regrettable to say that I cannot see this disease NOT being possible to spread, even if gloves, a coat and a mask were used in the arrangement of the food. It’s airborne and transmitted very easily on surfaces.

fikt6ex,-0.9849,0.0," I'm from Iran and I can confirm with confidence that numbers are much higher. [43 cases and 8 deaths](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f87kz9/iran_now_has_43_confirmed_cases_and_8_deaths/) is government's stats which is unreliable as always, but multiple local sources in hospitals tell another story. '38 people dead' has been reported by some individual source which is probably much more close to the real number.Arriving passengers from Corona infected countries have been checked up with the most unreliable digital thermometers over the past few weeks. Some hospitals (specified for Corona infected patients) don't have n95 masks for their nurses and doctors. Many interns and nurses have refused to show up to work due to absence of facilities. No city has been quarantined. Schools are closed in order to get sterilized but the government doesn't have enough resources, no school hasn't been sterilized since. They just say stuff for show. Some sterilizing solutions (containing alcohol and necessary for clinics and hospitals) has gotten quite rare.So we're pretty much on our own and thus fucked up! Meanwhile I've heard that not only antibiotics don't have any effect on Coronavirus, they rather tend to weaken the body's immune system. In Iran we use antibiotics for every minor flu patient, even colds. And I reckon immune systems are pretty weak between the people of Iran compared to many other countries in which doctors hardly prescribe cold tablets. I was diagnosed with flu last night and my doctor prescribed me with penicillin and antibiotic pills I refused to take.So do you guys think I did the right thing?

So He went to the hospital in Chiba Pref., and took a flu test (got negative).  >His symptom didn't improve on Feb. 19, so he went to this hospital and diagnosed as pneumonia, though he call neither for consultation (for the corona virus) nor for the public health center.  >He was hospitalized in another hospital on Feb. 21, taken a sample and diagnosed, and his infection had finally confirmed on Feb. 22.  >He lives alone, and still with fever of 38.0+ Celsius degree as well as coughing.  >He has no recent travel history to abroad within 2 weeks before his initial symptom on Feb. 12, neither has he any obvious contact with pneumonia patients'.  +++  (Added:) Asahi Shinbun (in Japanese) reports that he took Shinkansen (express train) from Tokyo to Hiroshima on Feb. 12 when he pushed through his business trip as had previously planned in spite of his early symptom.

filhcix,-0.9586,0.0,">Japan’s confirmed cases are those who visit the hospitals themselves? Thus the low numbers?  The confirmed in Japan seem to consist mainly of the following three categories:  * Category A: those who visit the hospitals themselves, as you described above* Category B: those who are in serious pneumonia condition (and the hospital or the public health center decided to conduct PCR test on them)* Category C: The close contacts of the confirmed (and the authority decided to monitor them)   >It doesn’t seem like they’re mass testing like Italy and SK?  Of these three, only Pattern C might corresponds with mass testing you mentioned above, but the overall scale of the 'mass testing' in Japan seems to be rather modest compared with these two countries (focusing predominantly only on the family members or symptomatic ones in Japan).  The following is some examples/ histories of each categories of the case I tried to translate and posted in this subreddit recently:  * Category A: An 40s male office worker in Chiba Prefecture, confirmed on Feb. 23, in this thread.* Category B: [The 21th and the 26th in cumulative in Hokkaido, confirmed on Feb. 23](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f89fug/japan_8_more_confirmed_in_hokkaido_9_in_total/) (They cannot speak by themselves anymore in severe conditions with ventilator) * Category C: [2nd case in Ishikawa, son of the 1st confirmed civil worker and still asymptomatic, confirmed on Feb. 22](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7ucda/japan_feb_22_jsts_last_new_confirmed_26th_in/)Japan's main problems in the virus diagnosis are:  * The doctor and the public health center tend to prioritize flu test to Sars-Cov-2 (the new corona virus) PCR test at first unless those who wished to visit the hospital by themselves to take a test had a clear connection with Wuhan, Hubei, or the Chinese, so many new confirmed of the pattern A often have to visit several hospitals before they are finally allowed to take PCR test and to be confirmed.  * The current guideline of the Japanese government also specifies that only those who has got fever (more than 37.5 Celsius degree) lasting at least 4 days are eligible to take a PCR test for Sars-Cov-2 (Covid-19).  Together with the prioritization I mentioned above, it tend to take 5 days or more for the majority of category A confirmed finally admitted to take a test, until then they often increase their close contact (by visiting several hospitals) or even some kept working in spite of their symptom, as narrated in Chiba case above.  * Another category The doctor and the public health center are somewhat willing to test is category B (the patient of pneumonia, serious dyspnea), but the government guideline did not allow them to be tested until Feb. 12 unless they had some links with China.Thus, taken these three factors into consideration,  the majority of the new confirmed in Japan tend to be those who had already developed into severe symptom (Category A  & B). Otherwise, they had neglected to take the eligible without Chinese connection into consideration (Pattern A/ B before Feb. 12). In short, it is likely to their (our) cases in Japan are vastly underrepresented especially before Feb. 12.","[Japan] 1 more (10th in cumulative) confirmed in Chiba Pref., 40s male officer worker, without any known connection - NHK (in Japanese) - 19:59 +0900 Feb. 23, 2020",2020-02-23 04:03:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f88mc1/japan_1_more_10th_in_cumulative_confirmed_in/

It seems scary, I know, but the reality is that the odds are greatly in your favor of surviving. Things will be really different for awhile and it will be unfamiliar and scary but we can make it though this. It feels out of control but there are things you can control to protect you and yours. Just focus on preparing as best you can. Wash hands properly and very frequently. [Clean Hands Save Lives (pdf). Wet hands first and then soap. Avoid touching your face. Avoid touching surfaces unnecessarily. Minimize trips out especially to crowded places. Buy soap—real soap (and maybe good hand lotion). Also, buy surface disinfectant / sanitizer, whether that is 70% isopropyl alcohol, chlorine bleach, EPA certified spray or wipe disinfectants, and learn how to use them and how long to leave each, wet, on the surface, to kill common viruses and bacteria. We should probably all be doing this anyway during flu season. To help minimize trips to stores, I have stocked up on canned and dry goods, all things we normally eat anyway, just extra of everything. Also we buy toilet paper and paper towels in bulk already.Top off toiletries, dishwashing detergent or soap (whatever you use), laundry detergent, batteries, and any other consumables that you use regularly in daily life. Probably a good idea to have acetaminophen and ibuprofen on hand.Refill prescription drugs if you can. I personally don't think the municipal water supply will have issues in the US so I don't plan to store water but I can. Most recommendations are about 4 liters (one gallon) per person per day.Let your preparations help you regain some sense of control, try to find some peace, don't believe every bad thing you read, remain ruthlessly logical and rational.Do things you enjoy, Carpe diem (ha, like I, a stupid American, need to tell an Italian how to enjoy life lol). All this to reduce stress because stress helps no one. Eat healthy, get enough sleep. You're good to go. This too shall pass. I've been to Italy once during December—Rome, Firenze, Venice. It was the most amazing trip. I was struck by all the beauty and history always surrounding everything. It just seems like quality of life is just so good there.

The “sick man of Asia” trope was subsequently used by the British and other countries to mock the impoverished appearance of opium abusers which is really fucked up when they are the ones selling opium to China in the first place.

fild7fo,-0.9312,0.0,"Well, the earth has roughly 7.7 billion people. By most estimates, not more than 2/3 of the world will get it, partly because some people are hermits, others are rural, and yet others are hypochondriacs and naturally very clean. So ballpark 5 billion infections is the most we’d see, and once we’re at somewhere around 2.5-3 billion, we’ll be at the peak as it would be downhill from there. From today’s roughly 100,000 known and unknown cases to 3 billion is 30,000x. Based on the numbers we know, it is growing at about 20% per day (compounded daily growth rate). BUT, as the percentage of the population that is infected grows, the growth percentage will slow down. You’d need to ask an epidemiologist at what rate this would slow as a greater percent is infected, but my guess is that at 50% of the world infected, the contagion rate would be half of the 20%, or maybe 10%. So the average to get to half contagion would be (20+10)/2 = 15%. This is completely a guess and could be completely wrong. But based on this...1.15^x = 30,000x ln 1.15= ln 30,000x = ln 30,000 / ln 1.15x = 73.74 daysThat’s 2.5 months from today, roughly, that would put the peak May 7th, roughly. Some places like bigger cities and tourist areas will peak before this, and others that are more rural or harder to get to or places that see less travelers will see a peak later in May or even in June. These are guesstimates. I am not knowledgeable in this field, and am basing this on simple “off the cuff” math.Edit: fixed typos",International (non-Cruise Ship) Covid-19 Chart (2020-02-23),2020-02-23 10:48:30,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8dro3/international_noncruise_ship_covid19_chart/

Since Friday, when the outbreak in northern Italy has been discovered, I've been scrolling the Covid-19 related subs frantically in search of info. I live in a major city in Croatia, and Italy is our neighbor. Tourists often visit both countries, when touring this region. And like it's not enough, it's a carnival season - so huge gatherings have been a thing for last couple of weekends. I'm worried, as I have a small kid. And my father is an MD, who is kept in dark due to our health authorities not really taking this situation seriously. I have a feeling this situation in Italy might be a wake up call for all European health authorities. I hope so at least. And while I really do appreciate I have a place to get an instant info from - it can get overwhelming. I went trough a rollercoaster of emotions in past couple of days.

fimalrd,0.9921,0.4939,"I'm currently living in Shanghai and I'll let everyone know about my experience dealing with stress and quarantine over here.  It's definitely not as bad as in Wuhan, but I think the mental barriers are similar.Like someone said earlier, it's so easy to get lost in the influx of media whether it's true or false.  I actually was in Wuhan for a business day trip the first time news got out about a potential new virus there, but luckily I wasn't anywhere near the epicenter and thankfully, am still healthy today.  Take the news in but don't get bogged down by it - it sucks, sure, and there are still a lot of uncertainties about COVID-19, but you need to remain calm and use your judgement to see how to plan for a potential self or mandatory lock-down.Overall, I've been OK but did have bouts of depression and lots of boredom.  I flew my family back to the US just to ride things out while I focus on my business here in China.  I have been basically in my apartment, alone, for over a month now.  Luckily, Shanghai is a metropolis and getting groceries delivered to my apartment complex is as easy as using an app.The first 1.5 weeks were the hardest - trying to adapt to not having my wife and kid around, in an empty apartment.  You have to manage your mental state - that's the most important thing.  I began a diet and worked out to help increase dopamine and serotonin to offset boredom and depression.  I caught up on Netflix but maintained a daily routine so I can space out episodes/movies instead of binge watching them.  Eating healthier during this period is essential - junk food will make you feel worse both physically and mentally.  It goes without saying that good nutrition is essential to maintaining equilibrium.Next few weeks were basically the same.  I guess I can relate it to being in jail (not that I've ever experienced that) but you just have to establish routines so won't fall into a cycle of being bored, thinking about how shitty things are getting, and then becoming depressed.  I also recommend learning some new skills while you're at home.My friends who had their families together I think fared OK other than the fact that they had to constantly find new ideas and things to do with their kids being indoors all day.  Oh yeah, I've also became a fairly good cook, since now I look forward to my own healthy concoctions.Over the last month, things have gotten increasingly better here in Shanghai, and mandatory lock-downs in certain communities where the infected were found are being removed.  Knock on wood that the virus doesn't mutate and another lock-down goes into effect, but I actually took a stroll outside yesterday with my face mask on and with hand sanitizer in my pocket.I think the most important things are:  1) **Food** \- if you have food or can get food delivered to you, there is no reason to leave the house other than to toss away garbage.  You can live indefinitely like this.  2) **Caution** \- protect yourself when going out.  The only way you can get infected are through droplets and potentially aerosols, so that means wearing face masks, glasses, and gloves.  Make sure to separate your outdoor clothes from your indoor ones, as viruses can stay on there for a day or more.   3) **Mental State** \- this is the most important next to having food.  Staying healthy mentally will get you through anything.Any government in the world will do their best to contain this thing, for fear of their own families getting infected.  You just need to watch out, keep on living, and wait for the thing to pass if it gets near you.  The moment your mental state deteriorates and get caught up in the ""fear media"" is the moment you will freak out for your lives, even though it's really not that bad.Infected individuals usually will recover unless you are older with other complications, so this population of people need to take extra caution.Hope this helps - stay strong!

In fact, it's so under control he proposed we cut the CDC budget by 16% next year.In March of 2018, he appointed the Best Person^(TM) to lead the CDC, Robert Redfield. He had extensive governmental experience in viral disease control, having spearheaded the Bush era effort to combat HIVs spread with the the medical industries best known practice: abstinence education.Of course, like all Trump appointees, lies have been spread about him. Democrats (Biden in particular) have fabricated accusations of sloppy research and data fabrication in his professional vaccine research. Worse, if it hadn't been for Ukraine interfering with Redfield's Walter Reid trial results, we would have an approved working AIDS vaccine today.Also, you know you're in the best hands when Trump's in charge. A self-described germophobe, nobody understands better how important it is to keep infected persons far away from himself, and that's why he appointed Redfield.Redfield has experience driving HIV soldiers out of the military with dishonorable discharges to help keep our men safe from HIV.  That experience has given him the expertise required to keep the current situation so well under control that it's not necessary to have test kits available right away.  To be as efficient as possible, we will dishonorably discharge the civilians found to be carrying the disease as soon as they start to show symptoms.Always remember, saving yourself for marriage means saving yourself from COVID-19.Glad I could help you understand our low infection numbers!

fili5aw,0.9983,-0.34,"Google translate -it’s all I could find. Paragraph spacing added. Take with grain of salt letter to all citizensDear citizens,After the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, the Party Central Committee attached great importance to it, and General Secretary Xi Jinping personally directed and deployed in person, pointing out the direction for winning the battle to prevent and control the epidemic. Throughout the country, the spirit of mutual aid and friendship of “difficulty in one side and support from the eight sides”, or donating supplies or sending medical teams to help, has provided strong support for us to resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic. In the face of this war without gunpowder, the people of the city took the overall situation into account and understood the general situation, and they worked hard to overcome the inconveniences caused by the epidemic prevention and control. They demonstrated their perseverance and perseverance. With action, we work together to protect our common home.We are pleased to see that the general public is either waiting at home, reducing going out, or taking daily temperature measurements, consciously reporting, or actively asking for help, volunteering, or selfless donations and devotion to love ... especially in the recent community closure and control. During the investigation, tens of millions of Jiangcheng children actively participated, which laid a solid foundation for us to find out the bottom line and take the initiative to fight. Thanks to everyone's concerted efforts and joint prevention and control, we have ushered in a positive change in the city's epidemic prevention and control situation. Thank you for your participation, support and cooperation!  Barry is only half of 90. At present, the epidemic prevention and control is in a state of stalemate, patient treatment is advancing with all efforts, the virus transmission channel has not been completely blocked, and the epidemic prevention and control situation is still very grim and complicated. At this critical juncture, a little negligence and paralysis will let all the prevention and control efforts go to waste, and go to waste. Only by clenching your teeth and strictly guarding against death, can you reach the turning point and achieve victory as soon as possible.The community is my home. The prevention and control depends on everyone. The general public is the ""hard core"" force for epidemic prevention and control. In the face of the raging virus, there are no outsiders and no bystanders. Each of us is an anti-epidemic fighter. Millions of Wuhan citizens are a community of fate and responsibility. I sincerely hope that the citizens will take good care, guard their homes, take action, and participate in the family. They will form a copper wall and an iron wall for mass prevention and control, bringing together the mighty power of the people's war. This is not only responsible to oneself, to the family, but also to the society and the country.Citizen friends! In order to completely cut off the source of infection and block the route of transmission, the 24-hour closed management of the community villages will continue for a period of time. The short-term closed management is for a longer and happy life. We also know that closed management has brought a lot of inconvenience to everyone's shopping and medical treatment. We are mobilizing party members and cadres in the city to sink into the community, actively organizing volunteers to provide food delivery, medicine and other services, implementing ""health code"" real-name authentication management, coordinating the deployment of various resources, and effectively protecting everyone's basic life and normal medical needs. Please rest assured! At the same time, everyone is welcome to supervise and give more suggestions to help us better improve our services.Wuhan is a city of heroes, and the people of Wuhan are heroes. We firmly believe that there is the cordial care of General Secretary Xi Jinping, the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, the careful guidance of the Central Steering Group, the careful deployment of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, the strong support of the people across the country, and the tens of millions of citizens fighting alongside , We must be able to win the Wuhan Defence War.Victory must belong to Wuhan and belong to the people of Wuhan!武汉 Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of ChinaWuhan Municipal People's GovernmentFebruary 23, 2020","Government of Wuhan announced that the 24 hour quarantine of all residential areas will last for some time, while many reported difficulty of getting fairly priced food.",2020-02-23 15:42:21,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8i4cf/government_of_wuhan_announced_that_the_24_hour/

filv14k,-0.9852,0.0,"I tried to distill some of the discussion. Partly from memory. Discussion seemingly was recorded just before the big clusters in SK, Iran and Italy popped up (no mention and numbers mentioned were several hundred cases outside China, 75k in China or total, unclear). But most of the podcast wasnt about epidemiologic discussion anyway.~~~~Naming scheme (CoViD-19, SARS-Cov-2) stupid.Chinese data not completely reliable, but we don't have better. It's not horrible data. They do indicate that draconian public health measures in China are showing some effect.Good evidence that early treatment in modern hospitals significantly improves recovery, lowers case fatality rates.More male fatalities than female fatalities in China. Very significant statistically. Probably connected to very high difference in male and female smoking in China (30% to 3%)Mean incubation period is 5 days. 14 days for quarantine seems to be correct. Singular longer incubation happens (is rare), but that's always the case.Still issues with the reports of spreading after recovery. Not well established so far.Sewage transmission looks like an issue.Various treatments are trialled and interesting (blood serum from recovered patients, chloroquine, various antivirals). Data will take a few weeks to be reliable. Some discussion about it being a lab construct. Very receptor specific (binding site) discussion, over my head, to be frank. Novel animal based cell entry mechanism that is unintuitive for researchers. Other stuff about cleavage sites. 🤷‍♂️ Seems to have jumped repeatedly back and forth between human and animal, acquiring certain adaptations before becoming a h2h spreader. Pretty much debunking that this is man made in their opinion. (They return to that later with some other arguments, same conclusion.)Discussion about origin. Discussion about pangolin susceptibility. Highly related coronavirus found there (bat version is still closer though, but pangolin has some specific features that might have been pasted into SARS-Cov-2). Common reservoir between bats, pangolins, humans. Again back and forth cross infections, picking up features, adapting. Then outbreak.Illegal pangolin trafficking (China, Africa, Malaysia). Cuteness of pangolins.~~~~Some from the QA session:Infectiousness after 24 hours of no fever? Uncertain at the moment. Possible that there is some shedding, but smaller amounts. Mostly speculation atm.Fecal transmission seems probable at this point. Aerosolisation possible, depends on sanitary installation. Transmission plumbing dependant. Proper plumbing should reduce transmissibility to one flat.Some discussion about whether it'll go endemic in the US or could be contained once clusters are detected. With being forewarned, stopping or significantly slowing spread might still be possible. Health care system is superior. That said,  authoritarian China has social distancing measures that are not available in the US. Efficacy of those difficulty to judge. If high, that would argue for easier transmission in liberal societies. Unreliable testing might be partially due to faulty swabbing techniques. (Exact point of nasal, throat or oral swab matters a great deal for picking up the virus) So human error could be an important flaw here.Case fatality rates will be highly dependent on quality of care, availability of care for critical patients (hospital beds, ICU, ventilation). Speed of spreading will therefore effect case fatality rates significantly.Enough time has passed since initial spread and travel ban for some assessment. Good news that serious cases and fatalities haven't occurred worldwide yet in significant numbers. Theoretically even faster seeding was thought possible. Very hesitant to draw firm conclusions (*""we aren't epidemiologists""*).Quarantine on cruise ship was a terrible idea (*""we said so two weeks ago, they should have been sent home for quarantine, would have been better""*)Wearing a mask? Useful!Chinese practice of spraying massive amounts of disinfectants (e.g. bleach) everywhere was stupid and pretty useless.Asymptomatic spreading possible. Still data insufficient to conclude whether CorViD19 does, individual anecdotal cases not best to draw conclusions from. Case fatality rate of 1% is not trivial. Depends on number of infected. 1% is malaria level, which is a big public health threat.No indication of persistent infection. Partial virus fragments in fecal matter in recovered patients don't tell you that.ACE inhibitors helpful? Emphatic no! Doesn't work in SARS type diseases. The inhibitors bind to a different site of ACE2 receptor than these viruses. Useless.Quit smoking, it matters.",This Week in Virology - Exvellent virology expert podcast (2.5 hour Coronavirus update),2020-02-23 16:01:15,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8idem/this_week_in_virology_exvellent_virology_expert/

I believe that the South Korean government plans to expand daily testing capacity to 10,000/day within the week. Also, the main South Korean clusters are limited to the Shincheonji church and the Psychiatric Ward. This makes testing more effective.It's also important to the note that the South Korean government has changed their strategy from containment to mitigation. This means that they'll be much more aggressive in testing potential cases. It is unlikely that they'll place travel bans within the country.Edit: Deleted discussion around mortality rates because it’s way too early to tell and my calculation was wrong.

And they wanted to put folks in a building not meant to treat people with a contagious virus in the middle of a suburb 20m from LA. The local health department and governments of course would object and want to plansomething suitable for this kind of quarantine. Here is the link,’one or many sources reporting on this https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/22/costa-mesa-granted-federal-restraining-order-prevent-transfer-coronavirus-infected-patients/Edit to add txt from article A federal judge granted a request from Costa Mesa, Calif., on Friday to temporarily block the transfer of up to 50 people who were in federal quarantine because of exposure to the new coronavirus to a complex the city said was not suitable to house patients who might have the infection and could pose a risk to public health.The city said it was told the 50 people have been diagnosed with the virus and that the federal government and state of California planned to transfer them from Travis Air Force Base in California to the Fairview Developmental Center in Costa Mesa, about 40 miles south of Los Angeles. In its lawsuit against the federal government, several government agencies, the state of California and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, the city repeatedly accused federal and state authorities of not informing or working with local authorities on the planned transfer.The lawsuit’s allegation that as many as 50 people were diagnosed with coronavirus does not match up with the number of confirmed cases reported by the federal government on Friday. It remains unclear whether the lawsuit conflates with actual confirmed cases the people at risk of contracting the infection because they were in environments with greater exposure to the virus.The federal Department of Health and Human Services said it does not comment on pending litigation. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, which is within the HHS and is responsible for coordinating medical facilities, declined to comment.“The Defendants’ plan was announced at the eleventh hour, with no efforts to include local government leaders or local public health officials,” the city said in its lawsuit. “The Plaintiffs now seeks to prevent Costa Mesa from becoming ground zero to a state and potentially nation-wide public health crisis caused because the state and federal governments have not sought to include local officials and emergency personnel in the planning and execution of their efforts.”The restraining order prohibits state and federal government authorities from transporting anyone with the new coronavirus or exposure to the virus to Costa Mesa before a hearing at 2 p.m. Monday at the federal courthouse in Santa Ana, according to the Los Angeles Times.Costa Mesa is the first city to sue the government in relation to the growing coronavirus outbreak, which has spread to more than two dozen countries, infected more than 76,000 people and killed more than 2,200, the vast majority in China. But in other places there has been an alarming surge in cases with no clear link to China, and some infectious disease experts think the flulike illness may soon become a pandemic and impossible to contain.Costa Mesa argued that the Fairview Developmental Center, which previously served as a residential facility for people with disabilities, was “dilapidated” and surrounded by residential neighborhoods, meaning that housing coronavirus-infected people there could pose a risk to public health. The city also argued that Fairview was not equipped to handle coronavirus patients because it was recently deemed unsuitable for use as an emergency shelter by the California Department of General Services without two years’ and $25 million worth of work.Before Friday, the number of confirmed U.S. cases of the new coronavirus was 15. The number more than doubled this week, in large part because the government repatriated Americans who had spent weeks in quarantine in Yokohama, Japan, aboard the Diamond Princess luxury liner — where the virus had spread to hundreds of passengers — and opted to include 14 passengers who tested positive for the virus on the flights back. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were now 28 U.S. residents brought home from the cruise ship who have tested positive for the virus.The CDC also said Friday that it has changed the way it counts confirmed cases. One category will be for Americans who were repatriated by the State Department from the cruise ship and from previous State Department evacuations from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak. These people were at higher risk for infection, and more are expected to test positive. The total number of people repatriated to the United States with the covid-19 infection is 31.A second group of confirmed cases consists of 14 U.S. patients who picked up the infection either by traveling to China or from close contact with family members.The government this month began quarantining Americans who visited Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital, and banned most non-U.S. citizens who recently visited China from entering the United States. The restrictions were hastily issued, and states had little notice, prompting them to scramble to find places to quarantine returning travelers.

fima104,0.9178,-0.4215,"Well, yes - Dow Futures tonight after another weekend of virus news, and with having a possibly high percentage of investors and big fund managers unable to really think through the intricacies of ""what might happen next"" can mean we have a selloff.  Will it be followed by a big rebuy ride on the grand Yo-Yo?   I mean - cases in China are decreasing.   Cases outside Hubei peaked Feb15th and have been dropping.  (link to that in a couple paragraphs) This drop (I am guessing) might have to do with the Italy and Korea news - the realization that exponential growth might be happening outside of China now.   BUT - I look at it and just think about what the future might really be - and I have to take my own thoughts with a grain of salt too!   The market probably hasn't been right on this virus topic, and maybe I have been, but I am not so sure of myself either!  Despite profiting during this thing.  (selling covered calls, a few buying of calls and a few buying of puts).  Thinking aloud here.  China is going back to work - There are indeed a lot of people infected in China, but it does look like an inflection point on the logarithmic chart is indicating that China is out of the exponential growth - which is fantastic news, but nobody seems to be cheering so much - but I was happy to see that.  ""cases"" will continue but the exponential growth seems to be over in China.  It was the expo that was worrying me at first.   I was thinking 1 million cases in China by June, and I think that is not going to happen anymore. Hey Big ETF and Fund managers:  Have a look at this chart:    [https://www.reddit.com/r/China\_Flu/comments/f5tlzq/covid19\_daily\_reported\_new\_cases\_in\_six\_chinese/](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f5tlzq/covid19_daily_reported_new_cases_in_six_chinese/)It shows that new cases in China outside the Hubei, China region peaked and have been decreasing.   So the 400+ dow futures drop is for what?   The realization that exponential growth of infections will be happening in countries outside China?   And they big money suits just figured that out now?   I guess if they study commerce and zero science, this is plausible.   I really wonder just how daft the market can be though.   But you can't fight it either!   If yer gonna panic - be FIRST to panic right?  If the market is selling off, so be it - you can't fight such things in the market - you actually have to give it the respect - even if it may not be based on really good insight.Anyways - I won't be surprised if we have another Yo-Yo in the DOW.  Down Monday - Up Tuesday.    And if we have a bigger crash, well, it won't last.    This is likely not doomsday - it is horribly sad to think about the lives lost from this virus, and it looks like it is many times worse than the bad seasonal flu year - like maybe 4 times worse in mortality predicted so far?   That truly is bad.   Economically, yes, it could be a big negative for a while.  But of course we all continue once the virus dies out (hopefully!) and we are hopeful for a vaccine that is not a year away.     And as far as talking ""stocks"" on the virus thread - there is a lot more ""stock"" of bags of rice and ravioli here than good advice on equities.

If you are getting an N-95 mask, make sure to also buy surgical masks to cover over the Respirator to avoid impact contamination (sneezing and coughing). Although it says 8 hour use, as long as all you do is low energy tasks, your Respirator should be able to last up to 72 hours of usage. So now you have a very long lasting Respirator. A study showed that low energy tasks while having a Respirator only hurt it's EPA standard after 7 days of continuous use. So by that logic, by 72 hours it would have around 90% of its normal functions, which is pretty good considering your usage! Remember though, as soon as your filters get hit with impact germs you want to change your Respirator ASAP because it's then compromised. Don't touch your mask or face either, treat the surgical mask covering your Respirator like it's a biohazard.

I’m a doctor and I just don’t understand the lack of concern in the three hospital groups in my own area.

Before you ask I’m not the type of doctor that deals in the immune world, think neuromuscular issues.The two things I know are things that everyone on this subreddit already know.1.  Our ports are not receiving more than 50% of normal shipping, from China it’s much less.  That means we are running out of supplies very fast and the average American is not intimately aware of how little we produce domestically.  We have only months of reserves for so many things and the clock has already been ticking.2.  Closely tied to point 1, our hospitals are already having issues getting very simple things like surgical masks.  This is a huge problem and the rank and file doctors and nurses seem unaware or unconcerned.3.  Bonus point.  Our hospitals are already maxed due to a horrible insurance system that causes many to use hospitals as primary care centers and it’s right in the middle of flu season.  Our hospitals are not equipped to handle large groups of people in quarantine and they don’t have the room anyways.Don’t freak out, just go get a few months of basics before others freak out and hopefully we are all laughing about this in May.",Seeking your opinions- at what point will it be wise to start wearing masks in public in the US?,2020-02-23 18:51:47,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8klf0/seeking_your_opinions_at_what_point_will_it_be/

filxrwr,-0.0457,-0.6249,"Full Text :SEOUL (BLOOMBERG) - Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and other companies in South Korea are taking precautions against the coronavirus after a rising number of cases in the country, including the infection of a Samsung employee at a local production facility.The country's largest technology company shut down operations at a plant in Gumi City over the weekend after the employee tested positive for the virus, and said it planned to restart operations at Monday afternoon (Feb 24) local time. Samsung Electronics shares slid as much as 3 per cent in Seoul.While the novel coronavirus originated in China, it is now spreading to other countries, including Korea with more than 750 confirmed cases. Companies from Japan to Singapore are taking steps to limit the spread among employees and within their facilities.South Korea's Centers for Disease Control said Monday there are are 161 more virus cases, bringing the total to 763. The death toll rose by 2 to 7 people. The city of Daegu has seen a spike in case in recent days.The won dropped to a six-month low and stocks plunged after South Korea raised its infectious-disease alert to the highest level as the coronavirus outbreak worsened.The Samsung case is troubling because Gumi has a collection of facilities operated by Samsung, LG Electronics, LG Display, Toray Group and other companies. Samsung has two production lines in Gumi, about 200 kilometres (124 miles) south-east of Seoul, for some of its smartphones.LG Electronics, which has TV plants in the Gumi industrial complex, told workers who commute from Daegu to work from home. LG Display has instructed workers who have visited the Daegu area to not come into the office for two weeks, while headquarters staff are restricted from visting the region without approval from management.Samsung has shifted more than half of its smartphone production to Vietnam but still produces some of its premium models at the Gumi complex. The stoppage at the plant may affect production of Samsung's high-end models including the foldable Galaxy Z Flip and the Galaxy Fold.",South Korea companies prepare for worst after Samsung coronavirus case,2020-02-23 18:55:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8kmzf/south_korea_companies_prepare_for_worst_after/

It’s been crystal clear for weeks now. Things just are not adding up. The lack of response is a joke and embarrassing beyond belief. An absolute “shock and awe” amount of effort should have been put in place awhile ago. It’s either spend the money now or lose it all and then some if/when widespread outbreak happens here.  The economic impact is beyond measure if it hits here, especially if we are ill prepared.It’s no secret the entire healthcare system and insurance companies will be rocked to their core (plus an untold number of small and large businesses and even the government thanks to a tidal wave of unemployment) if we experience even a fraction of what is happening in China - and they still have a long road ahead of them.What could have been an opportunity for us to lead and unite everyone in the entire world in a way that is unimaginable to most, to bring us closer as one human race, and to fight for life itself in many cases, is quickly becoming a potential for the biggest fuck up in the history of the nation, IMO.This is serious; likely the most serious issue our generation has ever faced.If they are waiting for cases to pop up in cities to react to, well... by then it’s too late.

fim7mpw,-0.987,-0.296,"SEOUL, South Korea — As South Korea struggles to contain a snowballing coronavirus outbreak, its president on Sunday raised the country’s alert level  to the highest for the first time in a decade, which empowered the government to lock down cities, bar visitors from China and unilaterally restrict the movement of people.In raising the alert level, President Moon Jae-in is effectively acknowledging that the virus is threatening to spin out of control, after the number of cases has jumped to 763 in a few days and the death toll has risen to six.The world is closely watching South Korea, concerned that it has become another hot spot of infection outside China. Emerging outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy have provoked fear that the epidemic could turn into a global pandemic, as countries impose more travel restrictions and containment measures.CORONAVIRUS UPDATESChina’s leader acknowledges “shortcomings” in the country’s response to the outbreak.The United States has raised its travel advisories for South Korea and Japan, warning about “sustained community spread.” Israel denied entry to 130 South Koreans on board a Korean Air flight that landed in Tel Aviv on Saturday, forcing them to return home on the same plane.In recent days, the South Korean government has shut day care centers, banned outdoor rallies and postponed the reopening of schools in early March. Churches are asking congregants to stay home and pray online instead.But Mr. Moon said South Korea faced a “wholly different situation” after the quickly expanding outbreak of the virus among members of a Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, South Korea’s fourth-largest city, 180 miles southeast of Seoul. More than half of all the patients in the country are either members of Shincheonji or their relatives and other contacts.In Daegu, shopping districts, supermarkets and parks were empty as the government asked citizens to stay home.On Sunday, South Korean officials said they had no immediate plan to bar Chinese visitors — as some conservative news outlets and other critics have demanded — or lock down any cities. But by putting the country on the highest alert, they showed their resolve to take more aggressive steps if needed.This is the first time since 2009 that the country has been put on the highest alert; at that time, it was battling the swine flu spreading around the world.We should not be bound by regulations, nor should we shy away from unprecedented strong measures,” Mr. Moon said at an emergency government meeting on Sunday.The alert, known as Level 4, will allow the government to allocate more money for fighting the virus and make it easier for health officials to acquire the personal data of people suspected of being infected, as well as outlaw religious and other gatherings.It will also empower health officials to control air, train and other public traffic around the country.Health officials hope that the number of new patients connected to Shincheonji will drop significantly within a week or so. They have already screened most members of the church showing potential symptoms, and many have been tested for the virus.“We are faced with a watershed moment in the case of the coronavirus,” Mr. Moon said. “The coming few days will be a critical time for us. This will be a momentous time when the central government, local governments and the whole people must wage an all-out, concerted response to the problem.”Until now, South Korean officials had been reluctant to raise the alert level, worried that such a drastic measure would hurt the country’s already slowing economy, as well as undermine its image as a country safe for travel. In China where the virus originated, the economy has come to a standstill, while the country has been essentially cut off from the rest of the world.South Korea’s economic troubles have deepened in recent weeks, with exports to China, its biggest trading partner, sharply dropping because of the outbreak. South Korean auto and other companies that rely on parts from China have also suffered.Despite its extensive ties with China, South Korea had initially appeared to cope well in containing the spread of the coronavirus. After reporting its first case on Jan. 20, the number of patients remained low. By Feb. 15, the country had 28 cases and no deaths.A few days later, the situation began to unravel, when an infected patient was found in the large congregation of the Shincheonji Church in Daegu, a city of 2.4 million. Since then, the number of patients has exploded, mostly among members of Christian church and people connected to them.For now, the outbreak has been largely limited to Daegu and the surrounding North Kyongsang Province, which account for the majority of the infections. But several new cases have emerged in towns across South Korea, most of them Shincheonji worshipers who have attended church services in Daegu or people who have traveled to the city or have met people from there.“A large number of people gathered in a very closed space, holding their prayer services together for one to two hours,” said Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, referring to the Shincheonji church. “In such an environment, it was likely that even a few patients spread the disease to many people.”Although health officials have frantically tried to track down church members and direct contacts, they acknowledged that it had become increasingly hard to establish the chain of transmissions once the community spread began. Shincheonji worshipers have been noted for their secrecy, often hiding their membership even to their parents, said former members and experts on religious sects.In their efforts to contain the outbreak, officials have designated coronavirus-only hospitals and have required all people visiting regular hospitals with respiratory symptoms to be tested for the virus. With some towns fearing a lack of hospital beds, the government recently expedited the approval of newly built hospital wards so they could be quickly used to accommodate more patients.Subway stations, coffee shops and movie theaters were all required to install hand sanitizers for customers to use. The government also empowered doctors to order a coronavirus test even if a patient doesn’t want it.During a telephone call with President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday, President Moon sympathized with Beijing’s efforts to battle the virus, saying that “China’s difficulties are our own difficulties.”More than 10,000 Chinese students are expected to return to South Korea in the coming week after winter vacations, as their South Korean universities are scheduled to reopen in early March. That has raised fears among some South Koreans.On Sunday, officials said the Chinese students will be asked not to come to school for two weeks, officials said. The government also changed the opening day of kindergartens and high schools, to March 9, from March 2.“We don’t agree with the argument that we are trying to catch mosquitoes while keeping the windows open,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said last week, dismissing the demand for a ban on Chinese visitors, as the United States and dozens of other countries have done. He said more people have been infected by South Koreans’ returning from China than by Chinese visitors.The raising of the alert level came a day after thousands of older Christian activists dismissed his government’s appeals not to gather in large groups and pressed ahead with their weekly anti-government protest. They accused Mr. Moon of mismanaging the economy and being too friendly toward North Korea and China. At the protest, most of the participants wore masks but loudly chanted antigovernment slogans and “Amens.”“We will defend South Korea even if we get infected with the virus and die,” said the Rev. Jun Kwang-hoon, who had organized the rally, shouted at the cheering crowd. “Those of you who are here are true Christians. Even if we contract the virus, the Lord will cure us.”Choe Sang-Hun is the Seoul bureau chief for The New York Times, focusing on news on North and South Korea.

fim97xr,-0.9461,-0.4019,"Full Text :The price of many pharmaceutical ingredients has spiked for Indian drugmakers following panic buying and Chinese raw material shortages caused by the coronavirus lockdown. The price of azithromycin and other mainstream antibiotics has risen 50 per cent since the outbreak became public in January, said Rahul Soni, chief executive of Overseas Healthcare, a drug manufacturer based in the northern Indian city of Jalandhar. “When this virus wasn’t there, the rate we got from [importers] was Rs7,300 ($102) per kg. Today it is Rs10,500 per kg. Prices are extremely high. It’s a big problem,” said Mr Soni. China plays a vital role in the global supply chain of pharmaceuticals. Despite being one of the world’s largest exporter of drugs, India relies on China for 70 per cent of its raw pharmaceutical ingredients. For many critical antibiotics and antipyretics — medicines that reduce fever — the dependency is almost 100 per cent, experts say. Prices have surged in recent weeks as Chinese manufacturers have run out of supplies due to traffic restrictions and staff shortages. “We are charging our Indian clients about twice as high as we did before the outbreak. That’s in part because we are running out of raw material,” said an official at Jinan Finer Chemical Co, a Chinese maker of pharmaceutical ingredients. The official said many chemical factories in the disease-stricken provinces of Hubei and Henan had not received approval to reopen. He estimated a return to normal production by mid-March if the coronavirus outbreak was brought under control. Distributors and traders are making a killing S. Srinivasan, Low Cost Standard Therapeutics Another problem is logistics. “Less than half of our truck drivers have returned to Jinan and that (has) constrained our ability to receive raw material from other parts of the country,” the official added. S. Srinivasan, managing trustee of Low Cost Standard Therapeutics, a not-for-profit generic drug manufacturer in Vadodara, Gujarat, said prices of paracetamol had almost doubled since the outbreak began to Rs430 per kg. “Distributors and traders are making a killing,” he said. Indian pharmaceutical companies usually keep a stock of ingredients to last between one and two months. Large companies with diversified drug portfolios were better placed to survive the disruption, but smaller ones were more vulnerable and might face bankruptcy, warned Mr Srinivasan. The coronavirus outbreak has laid bare India’s dependency on China, on everything from electronic imports to machinery and organic chemicals. Indian pharmaceutical companies are “running close to exhausting their supply of raw material”, according to a February 16 report from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the business lobby group. The report found that importers were facing challenges in securing supplies of a raw material for paracetamol that is sourced from China. “India pharma companies have placed orders but are unclear on the status of delivery”, the CII said. The uncertainty over when Chinese factories would restart production was hampering Indian companies’ plans, said Viranchi Shah, director of the Gujarat state board of the Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association. “We are not getting any official news,” said Mr Shah. “If it was more transparent, things would be easier.”",Coronavirus outbreak causes supply problem for India’s drugmakers,2020-02-23 21:14:06,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8mcs8/coronavirus_outbreak_causes_supply_problem_for/

The testicle may also feel warm and tender.In affected boys and men, swelling of the testicle normally begins 4 to 8 days after the swelling of the parotid gland. Occasionally, swelling can occur up to 6 weeks after the swelling of the glands.Any testicle pain can be eased using painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen you buy from the pharmacy or supermarket. If the pain is particularly severe, contact your GP, who may prescribe you a stronger painkiller.Applying cold or warm compresses to your testicle and wearing supportive underwear may also reduce any pain.Just under half of all males who get mumps-related orchitis notice some shrinkage of their testicles and an estimated 1 in 10 men experience a drop in their sperm count (the amount of healthy sperm their body can produce).

When my premature niece was in the hospital, they offered her a used oxygen mask saying they just didnt have supplies. They put her in an incubator with three other babies before she died 3 days later at 32 weeks old. The hospitals are understaffed. A family member was hospitalized recently, there were several dead people outside the hospital and the hospital was so full there was literally no place for  visitors to sit.  The only doctor in the hospital (located in a major city) took a day off for the holiday leaving the hospital to be run by a handful of nurses. Many times Afghans have to get medical visas to Turkey, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, or India to recieve medical treatment for serious conditions. Ive seen this several times where family members have forgone medical treatment just because they couldnt afford it. My newborn nephew recently had jaundice and the doctor told the family that yellow breastmilk caused the baby to turn yellow... there is a lot of medical misinformation and no patient education not to mention very little sanitation. Many chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure is poorly treated.Afghanistan is known for the terrorist that live there but many of the people i have met are warm, kind,  very social (also a concern).
