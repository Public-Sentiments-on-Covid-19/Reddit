fimm3bw,-0.8369,-0.5994,"I don't think the current Chinese numbers are too far off from the real number esp. outside of Hubei, but the 2 points you mentioned are def skewed because of the early inaccurate numbers in Wuhan.1. the exponential growth rate; it's well-known that the early numbers were heavily capped by (manual and actual) testing limits especially in Hubei. Even the Chinese officials said it and the media reported many people being untested. It's probably not until several days ago that most people with symptoms are tested. Due to the huge infection number, I doubt they can test all clost contacts until today.2. CFR of ~2%This number is much higher in Hubei and it is obvious that their health care system experienced a TOTAL COLLAPSE. Thousands of doctors from other provinces are still there helping. Death rate in a place where you have almost no medical care is not the normal CFR. Besides, this number was also capped by testing limits described above and many untested deaths were not counted(this was reported many times by Chinese media and not an assumption/conspiracy). If some RFA sources are to believed, real death number was ~2-3 times higher when it was ~200 death/day.In fact it would be really strange if the numbers in other parts of the world fit these patterns.

Even though the government expands testing to all flu-like symptoms at public clinics (50 of them) a few days ago, my guess is that very few people have been tested this way. All new cases are local transmissions and we have not been able to trace back to their sources. Contact tracking is very poor.There was a Buddhist shrine with six  infections right across where I live. The infections were reported a couple of days ago. The health officials have yet to enter the apartment which holds the shrine. The guards of the building are not quarantined. The contact tracking is very slow, and the officials are still trying to figure out who went to that shrine.There is another case where a policeman was infected a few days ago. It took days to put close contacts in quarantine. Nothing happens to the police station where the policeman is based.The government spokeman did not even know whether the hundreds of people who came back from Diamond Princess (all under quarantined) will be tested. I don't think they are tested.As the actual number of infected people (undetected) increases to a certain amount, the number of detected cases will start to increase to a noticeable number (like from 1 - 2 cases to 5+ cases in the past few days).

Given Italy has banned the flights from Jan 31st to/China (first EU airline to do so) my family reports that they have worked flights FULL of tourists / Chinese Passport holders who have connected via other EU major airports.

I know with most younger deaths there's likely to be crazy exceptions, like how it's easy to keep telling myself doctors and nurses that have died are obviously not a good indicator of anything when it comes to the average joe, due to the crazy overwork and strain on their body and so on.At the same time, my parents are older and it's again certainly hard not to worry about them. Aside from the fact that I'm terrified of death in the first place and my loved ones being gone...a new infectious disease is obviously scary. Especially one that a lot of people seem to dismiss and act like you're crazy for being concerned about. The economic fallout...or more specifically just general chaos that could happen for a few weeks or a month or so of quarantine or just heavy caution, with the panic buying and everything that comes with it frightens me almost as much.

Before then, that word was never used, it was literally created to replace stupid, dumb, etc, to make people feel better.Like engine timing or something, ""retarded"" isn't in and of itself a negative term, it just means that it lags .. if your engine timing is ""retarded"" you're moving it so that it lags a little more than it did .. it's not a controversial word.  ""Just a little slower than everyone else"" ... that's what they taught us .. that kids were not stupid, that it wasn't that they could never learn anything, it's just that they lagged everyone a little bit, .. like if you just had enough patience they would catch up.  They weren't trying to get you to infer that if you just had enough patience they'd eventually become NASA engineers .. but that if you had enough patience, they'd catch up and could learn greater than / less than, who George Washington was, etc.  They trained us and taught us to have patience and to try to help the ""retarded"" kids catch up, to be supportive.Now, decades on .. ""retarded"" is a dirty word, and now it's perceived as a pejorative, .. and there are and have been efforts to replace that word with other words, because ""retarded"" is the new ""stupid"" and ""dumb"", and it makes people feel bad when you use that word.The word ""handicap"", same thing, I remember when people were just called cripples, and handicap was the word to replace that so that people with what are now ""physical disabilities"" didn't feel bad, because ""cripple"" made them feel bad.Well guess what ... no matter what you call it, .. nobody wants to be stupid, nobody wants to be in a wheelchair, and nobody wants to see a virus spreading around the fucking Earth.  And no matter what you call it .. a mother is going to cry when she finds out her kid has learning disabilities.  It just is what it is.  Ask anybody if they'd rather be ""differently abled"" or have their severed spinal cord working again so they can walk ... they're choosing spinal cord every fucking time.  You can call a pandemic ""Scooby Party"" if you want ... but in a few decades, people are going to be scared as shit about the possibility that a Scooby Party is about to happen ... because it's not the words that scare them, it's the underlying event.

fiobxgh,0.9834,0.5859,"And just to add: 60% Ethanol, 10% n-Propanol (not Isopropanol) and 0.1 % Phosphoric acid is the offical mix which works againts bacteria and both types of viruses (Only know the German naming: behüllt/unbehüllt).Ethanol is more effective against Virueses, while n-Propanol is something bacterias hate. And n-Propanol is much better than isopropanol.And because it seems the reaction of the alcohol with the virus is faster in an acidic environment, add acid. Here phosphoric acid is the best one, but if you don't have that, I am sure other acids (like acetic acid - vinegar, or citric acid) also help. Here is the German page explaining it: [https://www.allgemeinarzt-online.de/1588246/a/was-alkohole-koennen-1771801](https://www.allgemeinarzt-online.de/1588246/a/was-alkohole-koennen-1771801)I also checked the Robert Koch page with the tested disinfection solutions, looked up the pages of the producers ( solutions type B against virus - effective in 1 minute) and had a look at the description of the products and the safety data sheets.&#x200B;If you don't have anything else:  denatured alcohol, mixed with water to give aprox 70% (V/V) solution is cheap and enough for hands and normal fabrics, and for the floor just use bleach.

The United States has already declared a public health emergency which allows them to mobilize funds in order to waive the requirements in order to get on Medicaid or CHIP, our adult and child govement health program. It also allows for unprecedented negotiation of drug prices and drug reimbursement .  of course, they have to choose to do this for it to matter. It isn't default.The good news about this? It isn't up to the president of the United States. It's up to the Secretary of the department of health and human services, the same person who declared this an emergency. Who is of the mind this is a pandemic. We can only hope that this man will choose to mobilize these funds if pandemic level severe infections reach the United States. Of course ... We may not have enough ventilators. Or beds. If we open up emergency shelters (Like what we use during severe inclement weather) as hospitals, or used some of our indoor sporting areas, we'd have enough places to put sick people. If we demanded that any and all ventilators currently residing within DMEs or within a manufacturer's warehouse in the US, as well as all decommissioned but still operating low feature vents be used....we *probably* can mostly survive this pandemic. The breakdown on United States for those who are interested: according to a cladex study there are max 160,000 useable vents in the nation. If this pandemic were to be as bad as the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, we'd need to vent over 600k people. We don't have 600k vents.

I'm going to try to share it here and see if it does any better...\--------------------Dr Bruce Aylward shared some of the findings from WHO's mission to china in a press conference today. WHO Western Pacific twitter account has a link.The audio/video connection was very poor for me. But here's a few things that really stood out for me.... Aylward is very strong on praise of China's approach and the coordination involved. He stresses how coordination across boundaries (social, health, economic) is so important to the response, and that same needs to happen globally. He also believes that the public itself has a strong role to play in combating the virus, and mentions that tomorrow's report will have a number of recommendations for the public (which itself is unusual) but that this is one of the key insights from the experience in China. \[As an aside, I'm very happy to see this as it's a welcome change to the ""don't panic the public"" style approach that can lead to poor information (a strategy that backfired terribly in 1918 with the Spanish flu).\] Really looking forward to Aylward's published recommendations tomorrow.In addition Aylward mentioned four global recommendations (starting at around the 35 minute mark). I'm not going to do them justice because I found the audio so difficult (so take these with a grain of salt), but here's my best attempt:1. This is a new Pathogen that requires it's own approaches. So far people are trying to put it into a binary SARS vs Influenza bucket to try and figure out to guide their response. He said it's not either, and we need to respond to the diseases unique characteristics if we're going to tackle it effectively on a global scale.2. The Chinese approach is an ancient one based on fundamentals. It will work, and can work anywhere. Often it's tailored to different settings (Wuhan vs other areas of China), so tailoring makes it more effective, but the strategy is sound.3. Global response is going to be a challenge. Doesn't believe the global community is yet ready to implement these measures we're seeing in china. It's about preparedness planning. If we looks at what we don't have (e.g. capacity or supply chain shortages) it can seem that there's limited options or we can't respond. The key to success is to look at what you DO have and use that. Must innovate, and go fast with the approaches you have available. It's important to try.4. Use time better than we have been. THere's a long list or research and studies that we'd like to do, but need to act now and prioritize. There's tools we can use to reduce morbidity and mortality. But need to work together.","Daily Discussion Post - 2020-02-24 | Questions, images, videos, comments, unconfirmed reports, theories, suggestions (Weibo / social media/ unverified YouTube videos)",2020-02-24 09:58:37,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8v592/daily_discussion_post_20200224_questions_images/

But once that happens, never fear, the media machine will go into overdrive ..**. the more important thing to me is whether the communications from CDC and HHS will be ported effectively by media and their direct communications are solid.** There's been a lot of talk of how social media is disrupting effective lines of communication on this with fear mongering, but I think we should employ what brands have been doing for years –– get influencers to help spread the word. That's who (young) people listen to, and those are the channels that get reach. NOW ITS NOT PERFECT, and messages are bound to not be 100% accurate (neither is news reporting). But I've worked with many many influencers at this point and seen it turn into a real profession where they take it seriously and do the research (or have producers who do it for them). Plus, they'll have contracts with these agencies, they have to 'sell the product' which in this case is factual information about the topic. Youtubers are already doing this on their own, but I'm thinking it should be officially sanctioned at this point.","DOW is down 1,000+ points, South Korean Congress is in Quarantine and panic buying is all over italy.

For decades Tedros was the right-hand hatchet-man of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, leader of Ethiopia's 'Tigrayan People's Liberation Front,' a brutal military dictatorship rooted in Marxist/Leninist ideology. Many Ethiopians view Tedros as a brutal dictator in his own right. Little wonder then that Tedros is comfortable glad-handing and pandering China's Xi Jinping. ... To ascend to Director-General of WHO, Tedros hired a professional American lobbying firm to campaign on his behalf that, among other things, spin-twisted Tedros' nearly non-existent public health accomplishments (while appointed by Zenawi as Ethiopia's Ministry of Health) into holy water that converted Tedros into a global political darling. The truth of the matter is that, back in Ethiopia, Tedros remains accused of orchestrating several cover-ups of large cholera epidemics, so as not to tarnish his own reputation. Anything ""Doctor Tedros"" says or does is about nothing other than increasing his own political capital. And, btw, according to a 2017 AP article, WHO spends $200 million annually on travel expenses, no small part of that on five-star hotels, expensive dining and first-class airline tickets for its entitled bureaucrats. That's more than WHO spends to fight AIDS, malaria, hepatitis and tuberculosis -- combined. Given all this it's quite the wonder that America foots the largest chunk of WHO's $4 billion annual budget and bows to its constant cries for even more handouts.So there you go, now you know ""WHO"" ""Doctor Tedros"" and ""WHO"" really are.""",Interesting Freudian slip during today's WHO press conference,2020-02-24 10:25:11,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8vksf/interesting_freudian_slip_during_todays_who_press/

That’s the exceptional part of the Chinese approach that is being applied in an area where you got community-level transmission right through the whole place.”Aylward said countries should ""isolate the contacts” and not let them ""wander around and restart the transmission chains,"" which is what China did.  Aylward’s exception, though, was that it was not necessary to lock down entire cities as China did. “So I think the big message is: You can control this particular respiratory virus by using these measures.

The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28\[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)\] .

What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.2. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%\[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)\] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%\[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)\] .3. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms\[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)\] . This makes it much more difficult to control.4.

He has sought to downplay the impact of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer weather - something health experts said is unknown.""We have aggressively worked to combat the spread of this virus, tried to prevent it as best we could from coming into this country,"" Gidley told reporters.The administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.In a statement on Monday, HHS cited a ""rapidly evolving situation,"" but said the Alabama center was ""not needed at this time"" and that it was looking for alternatives.",Coronavirus: US confirms total of 53 cases as White House mulls asking Congress for emergency funds,2020-02-24 12:56:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8xzwx/coronavirus_us_confirms_total_of_53_cases_as/

fioea21,-0.8927,0.3293,"Germany is way worse. Here a translation from an article:  &#x200B;How does Germany deal with the corona virus?   At the World Health Organization, Foreign Minister Maas reserves the right to take tougher measures - and finds out how expensive a vaccine will be.  Christoph Schult reports from Geneva  February 24, 2020, 7:37 pm   At the Palais des Nations, the headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, visitors are greeted with leaflets. They explain the hygiene measures to be taken in the face of a possible corona pandemic: wash your hands regularly, sneeze and cough in the crook of your arm, avoid contact with sick people, wear a respirator in case of fever.  Heiko Maas actually came to Geneva to promote his ""Alliance of Multilateralists"" at the UN. But in view of the Corona crisis, the Foreign Minister makes a detour to the World Health Organization in the morning. In brilliant sunshine and spring-like temperatures, he walks over to WHO headquarters.  Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomes his guest in front of the WHO building. It is a sign of gratitude, after all, Maas brings the promise of three million euros in additional emergency aid. In English, the Ethiopian thanks for the ""great support from Germany"", and adds in German: ""Thank you very much.""  WHO experts consider risk of global crisis high   Tedros takes the minister down to the WHO crisis room. Here, the scale of the outbreak of Covid 19, as the disease is officially called, becomes clear. Graphs on screens show how dramatic the situation is. A huge map of the world shows how rapidly the virus has spread in recent weeks. Red circles of different sizes show how many infections the individual countries have registered so far. China: more than 5000 cases, South Korea: between 501 and 5000 cases. Germany is therefore in the same category as Italy and France: 101 to 500 cases.  After the recent deaths in Italy, Maas wants to know behind closed doors what scenario the WHO people consider likely. According to this, the experts hardly believe in an eradication of the virus. Either local endemics would remain or the outbreaks would combine to form a worldwide pandemic, according to the forecast. A few weeks ago this was considered rather unlikely, but now the risk of a global crisis is considered high. The Geneva health experts' message is that we must prepare for this.  Germany has so far reacted in an exemplary manner, praise Maas' hosts. They cite the convertible roof manufacturer in Stockdorf as an example. By intervening early, the Bavarian company had succeeded in locating and isolating the patient ""zero"" and his contact persons, thus preventing the spread of the virus.     However, the disease has not yet been sufficiently researched. The fact that some people are apparently infected but show no or hardly any symptoms is proving to be insidious. This means that in Italy the virus has probably been passed on by people who do not know that they are carrying it in their bodies. This makes containment difficult, the search for the patient ""zero"" almost impossible. ""It is unclear from when exactly and for how long an infected person is contagious,"" the current situation report of the Federal Foreign Office also states.  According to the WHO experts, the quality of the health system is crucial for combating the disease. About 20 per cent of the diseases are serious. In countries with good health care, it is possible to keep mortality below one per cent, but in developing countries the risk increases. The WHO is therefore currently very concerned about the situation in Iran. However, the situation in Japan, South Korea and Italy shows that other countries are not immune to a crisis.  ""We are monitoring developments in real time, so to speak""  Heiko Meuse   ""We're finding that the virus is spreading further,"" says Maas. ""However, we must not dramatise the situation. I think it will be particularly difficult if the virus spreads to regions that are not developed in the way it has.""  Developing, producing, distributing vaccines - that costs billions of euros  However, the Foreign Minister hints that the deaths in Italy could also worsen the situation in Germany. However, the Federal Government does not consider an automatic quarantine for all travellers to China to be necessary - at least not yet. ""As in many other countries, not all people coming from China will have to be quarantined,"" said Maas. ""However, we are monitoring developments in real time, so to speak, and can react to a changed situation at any time. We also reserve the right to do so."" At the moment, says the Foreign Minister, there is no reason to deviate from the previous approach.  Outside the WHO headquarters, Maas passes a bronze sculpture. It shows a doctor vaccinating a child in the upper arm. On this day it is a reminder that research on ""Covid 19"" is still in its infancy. Because one thing is certain: with a few million from Germany, the world community will not be able to get the corona crisis under control. A vaccine is needed for this. The Foreign Minister learned during his visit that developing, producing and distributing this vaccine would cost several billion euros.

fipfbsy,0.9855,0.3293,"Takeaways from a Ph.D. human-associated viral researcher on the US response in the last three days. CDC: It is likely there will be “community transmission” and a switch from “containment” to “mitigation” in the United States. -Summary Anthony Fauci NIAID (National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases - NIH) and Friday CDC Meeting. Those are very specific epidemiology terms: “community transmission” translates to source untraceable levels of transmission in the general population (means uncontrolled transmission, may be regional), and “containment to mitigation” translates to containment won’t work and we will have to count on Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs; closing schools, public gatherings, working from home / closing workplaces, sterility measures, rapid testing and quarantine - HHS term). CDC and HHS know it may be coming, and if I had to guess they are biding their time preparing for the worst case scenario.They know containment wouldn’t be effective if it hits multiple places at once, better to use more effective tests they can produce in bulk to quarantine effectively. The early tests are rather ineffective, may be issues in performance and reproducibility (Reverse Transcriptase-qPCR can have errors / biases in a number of ways), so they maybe less worried about catching it early and rather about being able to test the masses accurately when it actually hits. Thus coming up with an ideal test while China bought us time quarantining, and producing it in bulk.We may have serious healthcare cost issues in US, but if clear communication and measures come from the top we have a pretty robust health system. That being said, I think, and would guess the CDC is thinking, we could implement NPI measures quite effectively (closing state to state travel, rapid quarantine and heavy use of outpatient care, extensive work from home and workplace cleanliness practices in necessary jobs). The CDC was very worried about flu, one emphasis has been on vaccination and education. The other emphasis has been on mitigation, they know based on transmissibility and non-symptom contagiousness that Coronavirus fits “uncontainable” but are prepared for mitigation with NPIs. This is because the flu is uncontainable, one of our strongest systems for pandemic response is based on mitigation and not containment. Maybe it really is chickens with their heads cut off like many here predict. I’d bet however that the US response will start to prove one of the best if pandemic Coronavirus proves truly uncontainable.","""The United States has never been less prepared for a pandemic.""",2020-02-24 12:56:59,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8y0bi/the_united_states_has_never_been_less_prepared/

fioi13l,-0.7115,0.0,"How does Germany deal with the corona virus?At the World Health Organization, Foreign Minister Maas reserves the right to take tougher measures - and finds out how expensive a vaccine will be.Christoph Schult reports from GenevaFebruary 24, 2020, 7:37 pmAt the Palais des Nations, the headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, visitors are greeted with leaflets. They explain the hygiene measures to be taken in the face of a possible corona pandemic: wash your hands regularly, sneeze and cough in the crook of your arm, avoid contact with sick people, wear a respirator in case of fever.Heiko Maas actually came to Geneva to promote his ""Alliance of Multilateralists"" at the UN. But in view of the Corona crisis, the Foreign Minister makes a detour to the World Health Organization in the morning. In brilliant sunshine and spring-like temperatures, he walks over to WHO headquarters.Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomes his guest in front of the WHO building. It is a sign of gratitude, after all, Maas brings the promise of three million euros in additional emergency aid. In English, the Ethiopian thanks for the ""great support from Germany"", and adds in German: ""Thank you very much.""WHO experts consider risk of global crisis highTedros takes the minister down to the WHO crisis room. Here, the scale of the outbreak of Covid 19, as the disease is officially called, becomes clear. Graphs on screens show how dramatic the situation is. A huge map of the world shows how rapidly the virus has spread in recent weeks. Red circles of different sizes show how many infections the individual countries have registered so far. China: more than 5000 cases, South Korea: between 501 and 5000 cases. Germany is therefore in the same category as Italy and France: 101 to 500 cases.After the recent deaths in Italy, Maas wants to know behind closed doors what scenario the WHO people consider likely. According to this, the experts hardly believe in an eradication of the virus. Either local endemics would remain or the outbreaks would combine to form a worldwide pandemic, according to the forecast. A few weeks ago this was considered rather unlikely, but now the risk of a global crisis is considered high. The Geneva health experts' message is that we must prepare for this.Germany has so far reacted in an exemplary manner, praise Maas' hosts. They cite the convertible roof manufacturer in Stockdorf as an example. By intervening early, the Bavarian company had succeeded in locating and isolating the patient ""zero"" and his contact persons, thus preventing the spread of the virus.However, the disease has not yet been sufficiently researched. The fact that some people are apparently infected but show no or hardly any symptoms is proving to be insidious. This means that in Italy the virus has probably been passed on by people who do not know that they are carrying it in their bodies. This makes containment difficult, the search for the patient ""zero"" almost impossible. ""It is unclear from when exactly and for how long an infected person is contagious,"" the current situation report of the Federal Foreign Office also states.According to the WHO experts, the quality of the health system is crucial for combating the disease. About 20 per cent of the diseases are serious. In countries with good health care, it is possible to keep mortality below one per cent, but in developing countries the risk increases. The WHO is therefore currently very concerned about the situation in Iran. However, the situation in Japan, South Korea and Italy shows that other countries are not immune to a crisis.""We are monitoring developments in real time, so to speak""Heiko Meuse""We're finding that the virus is spreading further,"" says Maas. ""However, we must not dramatise the situation. I think it will be particularly difficult if the virus spreads to regions that are not developed in the way it has.""Developing, producing, distributing vaccines - that costs billions of eurosHowever, the Foreign Minister hints that the deaths in Italy could also worsen the situation in Germany. However, the Federal Government does not consider an automatic quarantine for all travellers to China to be necessary - at least not yet. ""As in many other countries, not all people coming from China will have to be quarantined,"" said Maas. ""However, we are monitoring developments in real time, so to speak, and can react to a changed situation at any time. We also reserve the right to do so."" At the moment, says the Foreign Minister, there is no reason to deviate from the previous approach.Outside the WHO headquarters, Maas passes a bronze sculpture. It shows a doctor vaccinating a child in the upper arm. On this day it is a reminder that research on ""Covid 19"" is still in its infancy. Because one thing is certain: with a few million from Germany, the world community will not be able to get the corona crisis under control. A vaccine is needed for this. The Foreign Minister learned during his visit that developing, producing and distributing this vaccine would cost several billion euros.Original Text in German here: [https://www.spiegel.de/politik/heiko-maas-bei-weltgesundheitsorganisation-anti-corona-impfstoff-kostet-mehrere-milliarden-euro-a-626c747e-cb07-4a6c-9e56-c0d32ca44b88](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/heiko-maas-bei-weltgesundheitsorganisation-anti-corona-impfstoff-kostet-mehrere-milliarden-euro-a-626c747e-cb07-4a6c-9e56-c0d32ca44b88)\*\*\* Translated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](http://www.deepl.com/Translator) (free version) \*\*\*",Germany is embarassing itself,2020-02-24 13:23:00,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8yfwr/germany_is_embarassing_itself/

fiof3zk,0.994,0.0,"> Drugmaker Moderna Inc. has shipped the first batch of its rapidly developed coronavirus vaccine to U.S. government researchers, who will launch the first human tests of whether the shot could help suppress the epidemic originating in China.> Moderna on Monday sent vaccine vials from its Norwood, Mass., manufacturing plant to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., the company said. The institute expects by the end of April to start a clinical trial of about 20 to 25 healthy volunteers, testing whether two doses of the shot are safe and induce an immune response likely to protect against infection, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said in an interview. Initial results could become available in July or August.> Moderna’s turnaround time in producing the first batch of the vaccine—co-designed with NIAID, after learning the new virus’s genetic sequence in January—is a stunningly fast response to an emerging outbreak.> If a trial starts as planned in April, it would be about three months from vaccine design to human testing. In comparison, after an outbreak of an older coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, in China in 2002, it took about 20 months for NIAID to get a vaccine into the first stage of human testing, according to Dr. Fauci.> “Going into a Phase One trial within three months of getting the sequence is unquestionably the world indoor record. Nothing has ever gone that fast,” Dr. Fauci said.> Public-health authorities say advances in vaccine technology, aided by government and private investments, are shortening development timelines when outbreaks occur. In the past, researchers scrambled to develop vaccines in response to outbreaks such as SARS, Ebola and Zika with mixed results. Older types of vaccines are developed from viral proteins that must be grown in eggs or cell cultures, and together with animal testing it can take years before a vaccine can be used in humans.> Newer approaches rely on what are known as platform technologies—building blocks that can be tweaked quickly with the genetic information from a newly emerged pathogen.> The fast production of a vaccine and plans to test it soon don’t guarantee its success. “You’re never sure until you’re at the end what you have,” said Bruce Gellin, president of global immunization at the Sabin Vaccine Institute. Saying there are other coronavirus vaccines in the works, he added: “The sequence of testing is designed to sort out what works from what doesn’t. That’s why it’s important to try as many things as possible that seem feasible, because not all horses will finish the race.”> It is uncertain whether Moderna’s vaccine will work because its gene-based technology hasn’t yet yielded an approved human vaccine. And even if the first study is positive, the coronavirus vaccine might not become widely available until next year because further studies and regulatory clearances will be needed, Dr. Fauci said.> But health authorities say it is worth placing bets on these new technologies in the face of fast-moving outbreaks. Since early January, when only a few dozen cases were confirmed in central China, the virus has spread to more than 78,000 people, including more than 2,400 who have died. The vast majority of the cases are in China, according to the World Health Organization.> Dr. Fauci said it is possible the spread of coronavirus could lessen during warmer months, but then return next winter and become a seasonal virus like the flu, making a vaccine useful even if it isn’t ready for widespread distribution until next year.> “The only way you can completely suppress an emerging infectious disease is with a vaccine,” Dr. Fauci said in his office in Bethesda. “If you want to really get it quickly, you’re using technologies that are not as time-honored as the standard, what I call antiquated, way of doing it.”> Moderna, which has more than 800 employees, was founded in 2010 to develop drugs and vaccines based on what is known as messenger RNA, the genetic molecules that carry instructions from DNA to the body’s cells to make certain proteins. The company is targeting cancer, heart disease and infectious diseases. It hasn’t brought any drugs or vaccines to market.> Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said he got in touch with NIAID after hearing about the new China virus while vacationing with his family in France in early January, to discuss collaborating on a vaccine.> Chinese scientists found the genetic sequence of the new virus and published it online around Jan. 10. Researchers at NIAID and Moderna analyzed the sequence and homed in on a section they believed was most likely to induce the desired immune response if incorporated into a vaccine. NIAID agreed to run a clinical trial if Moderna could supply a vaccine.> Moderna didn’t need actual samples of the virus or its proteins. The company’s vaccines instead contain nucleic acids with genetic codes that instruct the body’s own cells to make certain proteins from the virus that don’t infect a person, but trigger an immune response.> Moderna in 2018 opened a manufacturing site in the shell of a former Polaroid plant in Norwood, near the company’s Cambridge, Mass., headquarters. In the plant, employees wearing white lab gowns, hair nets and safety goggles work amid lab hoods, robotic machinery and steel tanks to produce drugs and vaccines for clinical trials. Meeting rooms are named after famous scientists such as Curie and Pasteur.> To make the coronavirus vaccine, Moderna repurposed some of the robotic equipment that was making cancer vaccines tailored to the genetic mutations of patients’ tumors.> As many as 100 manufacturing and quality-control employees were involved in the effort, many working nights and weekends. As manufacturing ramped up, the company’s leaders had frequent meetings, calls and WhatsApp messaging chains to monitor progress, and stayed in close contact with NIAID.> After Moderna’s effort became public in January, friends and family members became interested.> Juan Andres, Moderna’s head of technical operations, said, “I wasn’t used to my kid thinking I did anything cool,” but his 15-year-old son began asking questions about the project at dinner.> Moderna finished manufacturing about 500 vials on Feb. 7, a Friday. Normally, the company would have waited until Monday to start quality-control tests, but about 10 to 15 workers spent the weekend testing samples for potency and other features. The batch cleared most tests that weekend, but it took about two weeks to complete sterility testing. Moderna stored the supply in freezers set to minus-70 degrees Celsius.> One risk of moving so fast is that Moderna and NIAID won’t know for sure they picked the best fragment of the virus’s genetic sequence to target until the human study is completed.> “It is possible it’s going to work, but we have to wait and see,” said Mr. Bancel, Moderna’s CEO.> The first trial will be conducted at NIAID’s clinical-trials unit in Bethesda. If the first one is successful, a second trial of hundreds or thousands of participants could begin, which could take six to eight months, Dr. Fauci said. This trial could be conducted partly in the U.S. but also in China or a region where the virus is spreading, so the testing could gauge whether the vaccine reduces infection rates.> If the second trial is positive, the vaccine could be ready for widespread use, he said. How widely the virus has spread by then will determine whether it is given to targeted groups such as health-care workers, or more broadly to the general population, Dr. Fauci said.> Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com""",Drugmaker Moderna Delivers First Coronavirus Vaccine for Human Testing,2020-02-24 14:04:50,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8z4cx/drugmaker_moderna_delivers_first_coronavirus/

Given the percentage of the worlds pharmaceuticals China produces there’s an associated cost of keep production shut down vs starting back up.

fioz57j,-0.999,-0.5267,"At least 19 people, mostly seniors, died in a social welfare facility in Wuhan located just one block away from the seafood market where the deadly Covid-19 outbreak is suspected to have originated, even though the local government acknowledged only one death from the virus.As of last Thursday, 11 seniors died from respiratory failure after recurrent fevers, a nurse at Wuhan Social Welfare Institute told Caixin. She said the facility’s infirmary didn’t have Covid-19 testing capability and many medical workers have had fever symptoms. The facility recently arranged chest CT scans at a nearby hospital for residents and staff. A scan report the nurse showed a Caixin reporter states that the patient has multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs, similar to many confirmed Covid-19 cases.Unexplained deaths from lung ailments among the elderly at the Wuhan Social Welfare Institute and similar facilities suggest that nursing homes may be another blind spot as the government’s epidemic-fighting efforts have focused on hospitals and other communities. Last week it came to light that Chinese prisons reported more than 500 previously uncounted Covid-19 cases among guards and inmates.At least two other nursing homes in Wuhan also recorded deaths either possibly from the virus or confirmed cases. A family member of an 85-year-old resident at Gu Tian Rong Ji Nursing Center told Caixin his mother died at the nursing home and the family suspected she was infected by a care worker. The head of the nursing home acknowledged that one of the caregivers was confirmed with the coronavirus but denied that the deceased resident was infected by the worker.Another community senior care center with about 40 residents also found eight tested positive for the virus. The rest of the residents and staff are quarantined at the center and no visitors are allowed, a community worker said.The Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau disputed the report about the Wuhan Social Welfare Institute Friday night through the government’s official WeChat account, saying the facility checked its residents and staff and found that 11 seniors tested positive for the virus and one of them died while being transferred to a hospital.According to the government response, the welfare facility started testing residents and staff Feb. 11, although Caixin learned from sources that multiple seniors died between late December and Feb. 19 after showing virus symptoms such as fever, breathing difficulty and loss of appetite.After Wuhan tightened quarantine measures to restrict people from leaving their homes and to send the sick into makeshift quarantine quarters, many people lost contact with elderly family members in nursing homes. Family members of people in nursing homes say they have been trying to find out how many residents may be infected, where the elderly are quarantined, whether there are caregivers, what test results show and whether the government can send more medical and care staff to institutions.A list of the dead at the social welfare facility obtained by Caixin showed 15 fatalities between Dec. 23 and Feb. 11 and four more Feb. 18. Of the total of 19 fatalities, only the death of an 83-year-old male Feb. 15 was clearly linked to Covid-19. Eight others were attributed to infections, including six to lung infections and two deaths from shock caused by infection. The remaining 10 fatalities were reportedly from other causes, and five of them took place before Feb. 11 when the nursing home started testing for Covid-19.The nursing home never before had so many deaths in such a short time, according to a staff member who has worked there many years. Except for one 27-year-old female with cholecystitis, all of the 18 others on the fatalities list were in their 80s and 90s and most had diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke or disabilities, according to the list.The facility, just a few hundred yards from the seafood market that may have been the starting point of the outbreak, is a combination senior hospital and nursing home. It is home to 458 senior residents with 190 staff, 21 property management personnel and eight care workers. The facility has been sealed off since Jan. 21 as local authorities stepped up efforts to contain the outbreak. All staff have been asked to stay in the facility.A doctor in the welfare facility’s infirmary said he participated in the treatment of a patient in late December who had a fever as high as 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). The patient died from septic shock possibly caused by infection, but the cause of infection was unknown because no virus check was done, according to the doctor, who was later confirmed infected with Covid-19 himself.The doctor said he treated three seniors who died since late December. Several doctors, nurses and attendants have also shown symptoms of lung infection, the doctor said.A care worker said more than 10 seniors died during the Lunar New Year holiday. At first, they had fever and lost appetite. Those with recurrent fevers were transferred to quarantine rooms but died after a couple of days, the worker said.“Since they were never confirmed with tests, we don’t know whether they died from the virus,” the worker said. “But before the outbreak, even though many of the seniors at the nursing home have chronic diseases, we have never seen so many deaths in such a short time.”A family member with the last name Zhu said he was told his 92-year-old father died from a heart attack Feb. 11 in the infirmary. The nursing home called the son Feb. 9, telling him to take his father to a hospital because he had a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit. As the son had a fever himself and his community was locked down, he couldn’t come to the nursing home.Some family members of deceased seniors told Caixin that the nursing home didn’t take sufficient protective measures and residents were not even asked to wear masks.The doctor at the infirmary said the nursing home wasn’t sealed off until Jan. 21, when the outbreak was already spreading quickly in the city. Because it was close to the Lunar New Year, there were many visitors at the nursing home every day. It hasn’t been ruled out that visiting family members might have brought the virus into the nursing home, the doctor said.A medical worker at the nursing home said it’s also difficult to implement quarantine measures because of staff shortages and residents with dementia.Hubei Vice Governor Wan Yong emphasized Saturday on a video conference that nursing homes face severe situations as the elderly are at high risk of infection. The Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau said Friday that it aimed to finish screening tests on every person in nursing facilities that have found confirmed or suspected vases by Saturday and will finish tests in all other nursing facilities by Feb. 28.Bao Zhiming, Xiao Hui, Gao Yu contributed to this report.",Exclusive: Cluster of Death Found at Wuhan Nursing Home Near Seafood Market,2020-02-24 17:29:29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f925p5/exclusive_cluster_of_death_found_at_wuhan_nursing/

fip0l07,0.98,-0.4588,"This thread is full of Westerners looking for cheap drama and run by a pseudo Vietnamese poster.  And I'm 100% sure he or she is not Vietnamese because no employer can force you to work if you surrend yourself to the government for testing and quarantine. In Vietnam, you can get tested pretty easily and it's completely free. My mom does her hospital monthly checkup this weekend and there are doctors and nurses staying ready at the hospital walk-in area for anyone to be tested.Vietnam was one of the first Asian countries to close down all schools and then also blocked all flights from China, HK, and Taiwan (retracted the HK and Taiwan rule a day later) as soon as WHO declared the global health emergency. We closed down an entire city when 11 people were infected. Go and watch Pandemic on Netflix and it mentioned how Vietnam killed 1.5million chickens during the avian flu outbreak and basically stopped the spread.By the way, how can ""money above them all"" if it is your decision to continue working? Your employer can't fire you in Vietnam without legitimate reasons and is required to pay out 2 months worth of salary per Vietnam's law. That's not counting potential public backlash and bad reputation spread on social media like wildfire if you voice your displeasure online.Outside of China, I don't see any Asian or Western countries being rigorous as us before it actually got bad - mass quarantine of 10,000 people over 11 cases.

This is an additional ring in comparison to the 3-ring system used during the SARS outbreak in 2003 by the Vietnamese MoH:Ring 1: The infected patients (F1) and family members (potential F2) are quarantined at the local hospital quarantine zone. Ring 1 will not accept any new patients unrelated to covid-19. Hospital staffs are also locked in. If a case goes bad, the ambulance and medical staffs stationed nearby will ship the patient immediately to the central level hospital. Electronic reports. The AC is turned off in case the virus can spread to other parts of the building by the central HVAC like SARS and MERS. Windows are opened for fresh air and sunlight.Ring 2: The potential F3 - the people who have had close contact with the potential F2, are quarantined in group at the newly prepared temporary military base equipped with the necessary medical equipment. Health check is done every day by the local militia, the soldiers, and the military medical staffs at base. Medical staffs and ambulance stationed nearby will ship cases showing symptoms to Ring 1. No AC. Windows are opened for fresh air and sunlight.Ring 3: The potential F4 - the people who have had close contact with the potential F3, are quarantined at home. Health check is done every day by the local militia, the soldiers, and the local healthcare professionals.Ring 4: The entire commune has to pass health check at the posts surrounding the commune and goes to the sanitizing process of having sanitizers spraying all over their faces and objects. In the case that someone outside of ring 3 shows symptoms, the entire ring 4 will be on complete lock down. Surrounding the commune, the military corp and military medical staffs assigned to the job stand on guard outside the commune for health check post, giving people emergency treatment for other health emergencies, and shipping people inside the ring outside if they’re not infected and have other health emergencies to other nearby healthcare facilities. Additional standby groups of soldiers, military medical staffs, and logistic corps are stationed around the Bình Xuyên district and around the Vĩnh Phúc province for emergency mobilization (i.e. in case the cluster escapes the Sơn Lôi containment). Field hospitals are built nearby just in case.All confirmed cases’ houses are sanitized and closed off for 14 days.Staffs in the rings are equipped with PPE. Civilians in the rings are given free medical masks.Food and other essentials for the staffs and the civilians are taken care of by the logistic corp according to military standard. Transportation of food and other essentials in the rings is conducted by the militia and soldiers stationed inside each ring.Vietnamese nationals returning from infected areas are quarantined at temporary military barracks similar to the people in ring 2. But now with the patients encouraged to work out in the open fields too.Cured cases, especially super shredder cases like the F1 who started the Sơn Lôi cluster, are continued to be quarantined in hospitals just in case unless they’re not Vietnamese nationals and are accepted back by their home countries.All schools in the country take the days off till (at least) the end of Feb.Border transaction and transportation between Vietnam and China are severely limited even now (1 land border crossing facility -> 3 land border crossing facilities in operation yesterday). In all 3 facilities in operation, the sanitizing process is applied to both the trains and the people driving the train. The drivers live in quarantine zones (ring 2 level of quarantine). All other Vietnamese official border crossing facilities and footpaths with China, Laos, and Cambodia are guarded by the local militia and military corps. All airports are close to mainland China. All people from outside country regardless of nationality have to go through the thermal scan and a healthcheck at the airport. People who have been to the epidemic regions within 14 days are barred from going to the country. The airport checking teams have the supporting team of medical staffs, soldiers, and ambulance on standby near the checkpoints. The gov might or might not expand the ban to other regions and countries depending on how the epidemic fares in other regions and countries. Medical mask distribution and sanitizers are prioritized to be shipped to the hospital system and people whose works put them at risk with the infection. Hospitals give out masks for free for patients. The rest are distributed to the market. Stores selling masks and sanitizers at too high a price compared to the original price are heavily fined by the local Market Regulation offices. Civilians are allowed to only buy a limited amount of masks (around 5–10 per person). Stores are allowed to only sell a limited amount of masks to each customer (around 5–10).The national market and some significant chains are asked to save the products impacted by the border restriction with China.The military, the Military Medical University, the MoH, other healthcare institutions and universities, and private Vietnamese enterprises are asked to cooperate with each other to study the virus, isolate the virus (successful, one of the first countries to do so), develop Vietnam’s own testing kit (successful, RT-LAMP technique, 70 min), and eventually develop Vietnam’s own vaccine (ETA 18 months at the earliest). Just in case.TL;DR: Listening to WHO’s advice at the beginning of the epidemic would have been a terrible decision lol. +1 for paranoia. Vietnam has learnt the lessons well from SARS. Vietnam’s slogans are “fight the epidemic like you would fight a war”, “the epidemic is a war"", “just in case”, and “better be safe than sorry”.",I’m still forced to go to work,2020-02-24 17:31:53,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f926xm/im_still_forced_to_go_to_work/

Not to mention that the national airlines (Vietnam Airlines, Vietjet) limited (if not suspended) their direct flights to and from outbreak areas (Wuhan, other areas of China, recently SK) very early in the game too. Which I believe should be how you approach containing a possible outbreak. You prepare. One infected person is all it takes. After that, it becomes incredibly unpredictable and unmanageable. The worst scenario is hospitals being overwhelmed. People die not just from the virus itself, but also from not receiving the needed medical care.

(I'm sure there are other options, probably over-generalizing.)I guess what I have noticed from the accounts of those that live there or travel there often is that the communities understand what they need to do and work together to do it.

fipdty8,0.8296,-0.0772,"I see this question over and over and over and people upset that the US isn't testing more.  But think about it...Most cases are mild and won't cause issues for most people.  If they start testing people like crazy and the numbers start rising, suddenly all of the people who have a mild case, or a cold, or the flu, will all make a mad dash to their doctors, hospitals, and clinics to try to get tested because all they know about this scary virus is that it's killing a lot of people elsewhere in the world.  The government and the healthcare system only wants people who are very ill to get treatment so that the healthcare system is not completely overwhelmed.  If there is a huge surge of people all of a sudden (most of whom probably either don't have it or have a very mild case and will be just fine), then there are less resources available to patients who really need it.  Also, crowds of people intermingling at the hospitals, clinics, offices means that people who did NOT have the virus are now exposed to people who do.  This scenario is probably a huge reason why Wuhan is in the situation it is in.  There is also the fact that they don't want people panic buying and emptying store shelves and hoarding things.  The fact is, the cat is out of the bag already, it's probably going to go around no matter what we can do about it but most people are going to be ok.  If they have already come to this conclusion and don't plan to enact mass quarantines (which probably would not be as possible in the US anyway because of the cultural differences) then there is really no need for most people to buy massive quantities of goods for themselves.  All of this being said.  I can understand why the government is choosing to handle things the way that they are.  HOWEVER there are definitely some things they could be putting in place now to further help prevent panic/patient surge.  They could implement a free teledoc type system for people to speak with a healthcare professional if they have concerns (and these professionals can tell them whether to stay home or if they really need to go get checked, and most won't need that, but it would psychologically help a lot of people to just HEAR that from a doctor).   They could ramp up efforts in disinfecting public transportation, putting loads of free hand sanitizer everywhere.

fipf7vv,0.9627,0.0,"A lot of this has to come down to how accountable governments feel that they need to be. If a government genuinely respects and fears its electorate, it will feel the pressure to be both proactive (test extensively) and transparent (reveal accurate numbers). I think Japan is being transparent, but not proactive.South Korea has quite a lively political culture, with a history of successful demonstrations. One example is 2016-17 when the public forced the resignation of President Park Geun-hye over corruption allegations. It also has quite a balanced 2.5 party system.Japan, meanwhile, has no culture of large scale civil unrest. The rallies here tend to be attended by fringe nationalist groups, who aren’t taken particularly seriously. It’s also effectively been a 1+ party state since the war, with the LDP staying in government pretty much uninterrupted.You can see then why Japan and Korea have been dealing with this quite differently. The Japanese government knows it will face little backlash from the public as long as it is seen to be somewhat in control (low number of confirmed cases = nothing to worry about). It would rather satisfy big business’s need to keep the cash rolling in and keep up appearances for the Olympics than take action. South Korea’s government, however, needs to prove itself to be proactive or it’ll face mass demonstrations and get kicked out in the next election.I think if you look around at what countries around the world are doing wrt testing, you can see how proactive/transparent their political establishments feel they need to be in order to maintain consent and therefore power.",Japan purposely not reporting Covid-19 cases?,2020-02-24 19:16:23,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f93nhu/japan_purposely_not_reporting_covid19_cases/

I posted a CNN story, that was titled something ridiculous by CNN like ""Romeo and Juliet separated on Diamond Princess cruise ship""... when buried in the story was the fact that Japan evidently considered time on the ship ""Isolation,"" when clearly it was not isolation because the virus was still spreading between passengers. So an American who was tested Feb 6 was released with no restrictions at all (and a letter saying he posed no risk) over two weeks later, to stay in a hotel and wander completely freely around Tokyo. The poor guy was horrified when he saw on the news they were releasing people without testing them. CNN reporter said the guy was shaking he was so terrified at the thought that he infected the reporters and everyone else he came in contact with. He called the CDC and they told him to wash his hands basically. It's insane!  And remember he talked to the CNN reporters face to face, who then flew back to the US. All of this was right there in the report by CNN but because I posted with a different title (I think?) and not the original Romeo and Juliet title, it was removed. Releasing Diamond Princess passengers without proper quarantine is the fastest way I can think of to spread the virus (look how many are testing positive once they arrive in quarantine in their home country) and  needs to be discussed.",China Is Censoring Coronavirus Stories.

fiq90pe,-0.973,-0.2263,"Thank you for this. I suffer from OCD - it used to be really bad but for the last few years it had been really under control (after a few rounds of counseling and CBT). I have been exhausted dealing with a newborn, my dad had a heart attack end of last year and work has been challenging (not problematic). This coronavirus thing fell like a bomb and just triggered all the typical manifestations of OCD: intrusive thoughts, germophobia, paranoia and ultimately alienation from the real world. I try to resist the urge and try to be rational but it feels like a visceral state of anxiety had set in and nothing I do helps. Case in point: I wake up in the morning feeling anxious before I am even able to formulate a coherent thought in my mind (and it is always about this bug). I am trying to prepare, I have some stock of food and water and whatever little N95 masks I could get - I may go to the market and get me some more canned food and basic hygiene products, but I have my family (parents, grandparents, parents in law) living in a different country, and I feel like I am useless here, but I cannot easily go back (plus, they would think I was crazy if I did). I am trying to find an angle to bring this up with them and advise them on some basic things they can do. Rationally I know that even if I was there I couldn't just lock them in the house anyway, and they would live their life as they wanted, but the feeling of being away is gut wrenching.

Croatia.We will raise the level of preparedness to a higher level, but there is no room to panic, ""Minister Beros said.""We introduced another type of surveillance yesterday evening. We have now introduced special health surveillance in self-isolation for people coming from the Italian provinces of Veneto and Lombardy. These measures do not apply to those who came from Venice. ""In that case, it's not self-isolation surveillance but surveillance without restriction. We are in constant communication with all our neighbors and together we are thinking about what to do,"" said Crisis Chief Maja Grba Bujevic.""Measures of control have already been in place for ten days, and now only controls have been introduced for people coming from those two Italian provinces. Measures for mainland China and for persons who have resided there for 14 days and for those who have resided in South Korea afterwards are still valid. February 16, ""said the Crisis Chief.""We have decided to designate these (Italian) provinces as areas with special measures. We now know that these measures will also need to apply to the provinces of Emillia Romagna and Piedmont. The measures consist of putting our citizens returning from those areas under control. They will be issued a decision on epidemiological surveillance. If anyone from these regions returns with symptoms, their sample will be sent for analysis to see if it is infected, ""said a staff member.Minister Beros pointed out that in over 80 cases the clinical picture of the disease caused by coronavirus is mild.Staff also said new quarantine sites were being sought. ""It will probably be a hotel or an isolated resort,"" a staff member added. Airports continue to be subject to the same security measures for persons coming from areas potentially exposed to infection and have recently been added to the coronavirus-affected Italian regions.Body temperature measurement technology is limited, we feel it is better to know the patient's movement and it is important that everyone is honest in this regard. It is an ineffective measure, ""a staff member said when asked about airport temperature measurement."" Infected doesn't even have to have a high temperature, so we don't consider temperature measurement an ideal measure, ""added Minister Beros."" The mask is good for preventing viruses. but healthy people are not recommended to wear masks, ""Beros said when asked by a journalist.Staff said that there would be a large number of Italians performing dental procedures in Croatia and that these visits would be specifically monitored. It appeals to dental clinics to adhere to the guidelines of the Ministry for the Treatment of Patients Coming from Crisis Areas.Beros said students returning from Italy were put under surveillance without restriction. The minister added that there were some misunderstandings about this. ""We allow everyone to take different measures in the field. It is important to note that we have adapted to official international data. If the situation escalates, we can adapt to them,"" the minister said.A member of the interior ministry said that temporary facilities were requested to be delivered to the borders so that triage and other medical procedures could be done there.The staff member once again stated that healthy persons who came from high-risk areas should adhere to the instructions already issued by the Ministry of Health regarding mouth covering during coughing and sneezing and regular hand washing.

fiqajno,-0.8296,-0.2732,"Regular flu has a mortality rate of .02 percent. Even the most optimistic estimates say that covid-19 has a 2 percent mortality rate, which would be 100 times higher than regular flu. Plus it has a RO factor of 4.7 to 6 which is about 3 times more infectious than the regular flu. I don't know whether these experts have been told to lie or if they are that ignorant on the subject but the data is there fore everyone to look at and it is clear that this is worse than the flu. Plus do they actually think that China would have wrecked its economy and put almost a third of its population in quarantine to try to contain it if this was as benign as the flu?",This is about to get ugly in Europe and the governments are helping it,2020-02-24 23:56:58,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f96x9v/this_is_about_to_get_ugly_in_europe_and_the/
