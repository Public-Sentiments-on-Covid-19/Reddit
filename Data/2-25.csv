Daegu is over the far east side of Korea.If i can put it analogously, its like when a typhoon is about to roll through rather than a zombie apocalypse. People are still finishing off things, doing some shopping, making sure they're prepared. I went for a shop in homeplus yesterday at non-peak hours (around 3pm) just to stock up on non-perishables, and it was busier than expected with other people clearly doing the same. But it's not panic. Not even remotely. Just caution. Most people are now wearing masks in public and i assume making liberal use of hand sanitisers in public spaces.Speaking of public spaces (restaurants etc), if i make a trip out to the convenience store (for coke, tylenol (have a molar that probably needs to be pulled) or cigarettes), i notice restaurants looking pretty empty comparatively. Obviously this is going to have a bit of an effect on the smaller mom-and-pop restaurants in the medium term which is incredibly sad to think about.Basically the situation seems sort of like 'this is going to roll through our town at some point, so the best thing is to reduce all travel/group functions to a minimal and wait it out'.

""Early symptoms were the same as a mild cold, there was no reason to suspect infection,"" he said, revealing that private practitioners in the region may become infected via their outpatient service.    The doctor is a private practitioner operating a clinic in Nanae Town, Hokkaido. He was the local physician of a man diagnosed on Feb 19, and saw the man on Feb 7 and 13.    ""At the first consultation, he had a slight fever and throat discomfort. It was exactly like a regular cold,"" he said. He explained to the man that since he had no foreign travel history, there was no reason to suspect infection.    The first time the doctor suspected something was wrong was on Feb 13, after a chest X-ray. ""Five days after the initial consultation, he said that he had a slight cough and some phlegm, so a chest X-ray was taken to check for pneumonia or bronchitis. It showed he had bilateral pneumonia. Despite that, he was relatively well - something I had almost never seen before, so I thought that he had to go to a specialist hospital.""    The man went to and was later diagnosed at a hospital in Hakodate City. The physician commented, ""Almost all private practitioners like myself risk being exposed to infection. If infection spreads, how should we be examining our patients? This is extremely troubling.""    To reduce the risk of the infection spreading via medical institutions, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has recommended staying at home in the case of mild symptoms such as the cold or fever, and contacting the regional ""Overseas Returnee/Close Contact Consultation Centre"" in the case of fevers above 37.5C for 4 days or more.","""Early symptoms were the same as a mild cold, had no reason to suspect infection.""

After reading this sub I do get paranoid but reality is she is sick 10 times a year from kindergarten and we have no confirmed local spread so it’s very unlikely. This is supposedly starting with fevers in most cases (>98%) and in the bigger study runny nose was also very uncommon (<4% of cases). Could be that the study was more focused on severe cases thou.But if it would however turn out to be covid19 , wouldn’t it be a good thing that we have it mild and that it’s in the nose rather then lungs? From what I gathered the longer you have the mild version the less likelihood it will turn severe. Basically gives you body longer time to build immunity. Most the severe cases seem to have escalated fairly quickly (with exemption of some very odd long ones with medical staff in Wuhan).Another way my mind is playing tricks on me is that I hear everyone around me coughing. Can hear my neighbours sounds like they have full on tuberculosis.. and everywhere I go I hear people sniffle and do random dry coughs.

No lung/breathing issues at all so far, but I've got one of those finger oxygen meter things coming in today to keep a closer eye on it just in case there ARE significant changes that would indicate I'd need to get checked out. Considering how badly i get sick when it's serious though (like the last time I had the flu and felt like i was on my deathbed), I'm hoping my paranoia is just misplaced and it's just a cold or strep (which it feels most like). We haven't had any confirmed cases in my state yet, just surrounding states, so I think we're good here for the time being, but this is still terrifying. I'm luckily an agoraphobe, but my husband and oldest child go out in public for work/classes, so that's hella stressful.

fiq5o13,-0.9727,-0.5563,"The economy was already decelerating even before coronavirus became an issue, especially manufacturing.  Trade issues were at the forefront. Coronavirus can most certainly push the global economy into a severe recession. Even if the outbreak is limited to pockets and contained, the net effects of it will lead to quarantines, border closures and the disruption of economic relations between countries. Indeed some of this is already happening. Because the policy remedies are extreme, even small risks of infection and death can have a drastic effect on economic activity. The big concern here is a supply shock that hits all levels of the economy and cascades into the financial system too. Monetary policy alone can't resolve the issue. Nor can fiscal policy increase production where the source is firm closures or supply chain disruptions. But it can fund measures to fight the virus, whether it be hiring health personnel, helping suppliers of medical equipment increase production, etc. If panic leads to a large decrease in demand, a fiscal expansion may be able to maintain higher output levels, even if not at the same levels as before. Monetary policy can help financial firms in trouble, but it can't fix the underlying problem of decreased sales and supply disruptions. Even if the virus disappears tomorrow, the economic cost is going to be large. I don't think we're prepared logistically in this country for a large scale pandemic, from a health policy standpoint or in terms of economic policy. And that's what we should be concerned about the most.","If the coronavirus isn’t contained, a severe global recession is almost certain",2020-02-25 03:33:21,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f98xyr/if_the_coronavirus_isnt_contained_a_severe_global/

Consider just the new ""baby rabbit pairs"" in the nth     month.   They must be equal in number to the pairs of rabbits that are  mature enough to give birth to baby rabbits.  This, of course, is  precisely the number of rabbit pairs alive two months previously, Fn−2    .    Now the total number of rabbit pairs in the nth    month is the number of pairs alive in the previous month (i.e., Fn−1) plus the number of new baby rabbit pairs, Fn−2    .

This will be suspended in water droplets, that’s how hydrophobicity works at that scale. Those droplets may still be small enough to be aerosolized, but certainly will not pass through masks. Replace / disinfect your mask properly and they will be quite helpful. When they say masks won’t be effective for containment it is not because masks won’t be effective at keeping the virus out, but that on a population scale failure of other factors like not washing hands / disinfecting / failed quarantine will still allow it to spread despite masks (too transmissible).

For me, I read the article as just a possibility, it’s the last line that turned it into “doom and gloom”.If the only hope is that governments take it seriously and do something, then **we are already doomed**, as they’ve proven incompetent and indifferent to people’s suffering.> The disruptions will be enormous but this is ain’t the Armageddon and end of the civilisation event.I see a lot of people exaggerating and overreacting, by **claiming** that “doomers” are calling it the end of the world. Yet, however I searched, I haven’t seen anyone saying this is the end of the human race.Actually, the most dooming prophecies that I’m seeing do come from people who downplay the damn thing, with them saying “the only possible alternative to downplaying, is the panic and the end of the world”.A catastrophic market crash, in today’s world, would have more effects on civilization than the 1929 market crash. Everything is dependent on the stock market, and people today have no inherent survival skills (heck, the upcoming generation can’t even listen to an opposing opinion without needing a safe space).But even in the worst situation, it’s not Mad Max scenario, and this won’t hurt poor countries as much, as people are used to live in their own, make their own food and survive or pretty much nothing.Yet, the very best way to avoid long term economic stagnation, things getting out of hand, panic due to unpreparedness and loss of trust, it’s, as the article concluded: Governments taking it seriously.The article compared panic in HK vs Wuhan. But that’s the thing: In China, the government showed resolve to stop the spread, communicated the quarantines and the rules, and took firm measures. Even if people don’t trust the government they know it has to deal with this as a survival problem. HK government on the other hand, downplayed things, refused to listen to protesters (including medical wing), and showed no interest in public safety vs pleasing their Chinese overlords. This lack of trust of course will lead to panic.Countries with less risks of panic? Singapore, where the communication has been fantastic.

fiqup4a,0.6862,0.3612,"Short answer: It's complicated. COVID 19 is so new and there's a ton we don't know. Some infections will grant you immunity for an indefinite period, some (as was the case with Spanish Flu it seems) can make the virus more dangerous the second time around.Some vaccines provide long term immunity, some provide short term. Some (in the case of Dengue fever) make it worse. With Dengue fever, if you get the vaccine prior to initial infection, it primes your body's immune system for an overreaction. If you get Dengue fever after getting vaccinated, it will make it harder to survive it. Ironically the vaccine will only work for Dengue Fever if you've already gotten over the first infection, and you want to protect against the SECOND infection. With SARS, it seems a lot of vaccines primed the body for a similar overreaction, so people should be really skeptical when vaccines are discovered. If it was easy to find a viable vaccine for SARS, it would've been discovered in between 2003 and now, but it hasn't. This is why everyone's saying 1+ year for a vaccine. They need to make sure that there aren't any negative side effects from the vaccine before they start mass producing it, and you can't figure that out until longer term studies are made.",Moderna's New COVID-19 Vaccine Ready for Human Trials; Stock Up 15%,2020-02-25 08:51:01,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9d5ga/modernas_new_covid19_vaccine_ready_for_human/

fiqshwn,-0.9433,-0.5,"Full text (Corrected google translate):  During Tuesday afternoon, flight IR727 from Tehran lands on Landvetter. Iran has a major outbreak of the corona virus, but there are no plans to stop the flight. ""Such measures have not proved effective,"" says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell at the Public Health Authority.   The flight from Tehran would have actually landed at 14.10, but has been delayed and will only arrive at 8 pm according to Swedavia. Later that evening it flew back to Tehran.    Iran has a major outbreak of the corona virus, but there are no plans to fly a landing permit at Landvetter.    \- Historically, it has not been a great idea to stop flights. The new example is probably Italy. There, all flights to China were canceled, but they still had a major outbreak, says Anders Tegnell.    He admits that it is possible to delay the time of an outbreak somewhat by stopping flights from risk areas to Sweden.    \- But two things happen. One is that people still travel, but choose other roads in the country which makes it more difficult to control. The second is that a flight stop has major consequences for the countries. We have seen that in West Africa, when you cannot come from there. Shutting down Iran cannot help the country with protective materials and the other necessary materials.   Information  Solution    The stance does not mean that you do nothing at all.  \- We are trying to do right from the start. There will be major consequences both if you do too much and if you do too little. It is important to do well, says Anders Tegnell.    Just in this case is to provide information on how the passengers from Tehran should act if they feel symptoms, in the form of large posters such as in English, Swedish and Chinese. Possibly also in Persian.    It should not be possible to avoid the message. The Public Health Authority discusses with both the airline and the airport if it is also possible to leave notes with information directly in the hands of the passengers.   Good readiness    However, rapid medical examinations of passengers are not required. This, too, is not considered effective.    Anders Tegnell finds it difficult to assess the probability of a coronavirus outbreak in Sweden.  \- What feels pretty possible in the near future is that we can spread around a case that comes here. But I think that we have good preparedness to deal with. We have a long tradition of tracing infections and have a good organization for it, he says.","Plane from Iran to land in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Trump's first budget proposal contained severe cuts to the CDC that its  former director Tom Frieden warned would be ""unsafe at any level of  enactment"".    Just a few days ago on Feb 11, in the middle of a  developing pandemic, Trump proposed huge cuts to the CDC and National  Institutes of Health.    Finally this past weekend realizing how bad it would look to have cut  funding to health and infectious disease programs during a developing  epidemic, the Republicans made a desperate pivot to and started asking  for additional money.

I work for a public library system that is the primary provider of Internet and computer access for many students. In addition, we remain open even when the schools close for weather because we are a safe place for kids to go during weather emergencies, since so many parents have no backup childcare options. On the other hand, the public library could end up being a major vector for spreading infections if we remain open while other public gatherings close. In my experience, the city is very reluctant to close libraries even when schools close. I wonder, if schools are being encouraged to do distance learning, if we'll then remain open so those kids can have access to their lessons? Or if those kids will just fall further behind their wealthier peers? Or if my city's school system will think of some other alternative? (Smaller classes-- ha. We're so underfunded we have 35 kindergartners in a classroom. There's no way the kids could be split into smaller groups.)","CDC outlines what closing schools, businesses would look like in US pandemic",2020-02-25 09:15:51,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9djjm/cdc_outlines_what_closing_schools_businesses/

fir8rrd,0.9842,0.2732,"I'm glad to see that the public is being recruited to help, sure beats that ""careful they might panic"" approach. Community and general public needs to be on board to scale the response.Lots of simple steps that everyone can take IMO. Starts with observing good hygiene. But for what it's worth, here's some other simple steps I'm finding helpful (suggest others share theirs as well):1. Supplies. Ensure you have a few weeks of emergency supplies (always sensible IMO, no just related to the virus)2. Caring for family. Think about what might happen if someone in your house got ill and had to be cared for at home. That's means things like a few extra cleaning products, a few masks (for them), a good location in the house, and ensuring other parts of your home are well ventilated. 3. Work/job. Make contingency plans to work at home or find out ways to go about your life that involve fewer (or zero) crowds. If your work doesn't permit that, then put aside some savings for a work absence (again, always a good idea, not virus dependent).4. Neighborhood plans. Put some thoughts into your community and neighbors.. what helpful things might you do together in the event of an emergency. Think it through (don't even need to discuss), but prepare to bring it up with them if needed.","U.S. CDC: ""We're asking folks in every sector, as well as people within their families, to start planning for this, because as we've seen from the recent countries that have had community spread, when it hit in those countries, it has moved quite rapidly""",2020-02-25 09:47:26,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9e1ga/us_cdc_were_asking_folks_in_every_sector_as_well/

fir00s4,-0.9736,-0.296,">SEOUL, South Korea — As South Korea struggles to contain a snowballing coronavirus outbreak, its president on Sunday raised the country’s alert level to the highest for the first time in a decade, **which empowered the government to lock down cities, bar visitors from China and unilaterally restrict the movement of people.**>In raising the alert level, President Moon Jae-in is effectively acknowledging that the virus is threatening to spin out of control, after the number of cases has jumped to 763 in a few days and the death toll has risen to six.>The world is closely watching South Korea, concerned that it has become another hot spot of infection outside China. Emerging outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy have provoked fear that the epidemic could turn into a global pandemic, as countries impose more travel restrictions and containment measures.>The United States has raised its travel advisories for South Korea and Japan, warning about “sustained community spread.” Israel denied entry to 130 South Koreans on board a Korean Air flight that landed in Tel Aviv on Saturday, forcing them to return home on the same plane.>This is the first time since 2009 that the country has been put on the highest alert; at that time, it was battling the swine flu spreading around the world.>“We should not be bound by regulations, nor should we shy away from unprecedented strong measures,” Mr. Moon said at an emergency government meeting on Sunday.>The alert, known as Level 4, will allow the government to allocate more money for fighting the virus and make it easier for health officials to acquire the personal data of people suspected of being infected, as well as outlaw religious and other gatherings.>It will also empower health officials to control air, train and other public traffic around the country.>Health officials hope that the number of new patients connected to Shincheonji will drop significantly within a week or so. They have already screened most members of the church showing potential symptoms, and many have been tested for the virus.>“We are faced with a watershed moment in the case of the coronavirus,” Mr. Moon said. “The coming few days will be a critical time for us. This will be a momentous time when the central government, local governments and the whole people must wage an all-out, concerted response to the problem.”>Until now, South Korean officials had been reluctant to raise the alert level, worried that such a drastic measure would hurt the country’s already slowing economy, as well as undermine its image as a country safe for travel. In China where the virus originated, the economy has come to a standstill, while the country has been essentially cut off from the rest of the world.>South Korea’s economic troubles have deepened in recent weeks, with exports to China, its biggest trading partner, sharply dropping because of the outbreak. South Korean auto and other companies that rely on parts from China have also suffered.>Despite its extensive ties with China, South Korea had initially appeared to cope well in containing the spread of the coronavirus. After reporting its first case on Jan. 20, the number of patients remained low. By Feb. 15, the country had 28 cases and no deaths.>A few days later, the situation began to unravel, when an infected patient was found in the large congregation of the Shincheonji Church in Daegu, a city of 2.4 million. Since then, the number of patients has exploded, mostly among members of Christian church and people connected to them.>For now, the outbreak has been largely limited to Daegu and the surrounding North Kyongsang Province, which account for the majority of the infections. But several new cases have emerged in towns across South Korea, most of them Shincheonji worshipers who have attended church services in Daegu or people who have traveled to the city or have met people from there.>“A large number of people gathered in a very closed space, holding their prayer services together for one to two hours,” said Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, referring to the Shincheonji church. “In such an environment, it was likely that even a few patients spread the disease to many people.”>Although health officials have frantically tried to track down church members and direct contacts, they acknowledged that it had become increasingly hard to establish the chain of transmissions once the community spread began. Shincheonji worshipers have been noted for their secrecy, often hiding their membership even to their parents, said former members and experts on religious sects.>In their efforts to contain the outbreak, officials have designated coronavirus-only hospitals and have required all people visiting regular hospitals with respiratory symptoms to be tested for the virus. With some towns fearing a lack of hospital beds, the government recently expedited the approval of newly built hospital wards so they could be quickly used to accommodate more patients.>Subway stations, coffee shops and movie theaters were all required to install hand sanitizers for customers to use. The government also empowered doctors to order a coronavirus test even if a patient doesn’t want it.>During a telephone call with President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday, President Moon sympathized with Beijing’s efforts to battle the virus, saying that “China’s difficulties are our own difficulties.”>More than 10,000 Chinese students are expected to return to South Korea in the coming week after winter vacations, as their South Korean universities are scheduled to reopen in early March. That has raised fears among some South Koreans.>On Sunday, officials said the Chinese students will be asked not to come to school for two weeks, officials said. The government also changed the opening day of kindergartens and high schools, to March 9, from March 2.>“We don’t agree with the argument that we are trying to catch mosquitoes while keeping the windows open,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said last week, dismissing the demand for a ban on Chinese visitors, as the United States and dozens of other countries have done. He said more people have been infected by South Koreans’ returning from China than by Chinese visitors.>The raising of the alert level came a day after thousands of older Christian activists dismissed his government’s appeals not to gather in large groups and pressed ahead with their weekly anti-government protest. They accused Mr. Moon of mismanaging the economy and being too friendly toward North Korea and China. At the protest, most of the participants wore masks but loudly chanted antigovernment slogans and “Amens.”>“We will defend South Korea even if we get infected with the virus and die,” said the Rev. Jun Kwang-hoon, who had organized the rally, shouted at the cheering crowd. “Those of you who are here are true Christians. Even if we contract the virus, the Lord will cure us.”","NYTimes — As Coronavirus Cases Spiral, South Korea Raises Threat Alert Level (to the highest level)",2020-02-25 10:17:05,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9ei4h/nytimes_as_coronavirus_cases_spiral_south_korea/

One minute you've got everyone in MSM saying that this isn't anything to be worried about, be more concerned about the flu, they say. You SHOULD be concerned about the flu AS WELL! Just because you have a stomach ache, does that mean that you also shouldn't be concerned about the knife in your stomach? People are generally capable of handling much more than the old adage ""not able to chew gum and walk at the same time"". We CAN be aware of an ongoing situation in another country that could potentially affect us as a civilization.By switching stances this quick, you're essentially dividing people in half. One group doesn't think it's anything to be worried about because they are generally uninformed to the goings on in the world, and to be quite honest that seems like a good place to be, it's safe, nothing happens. Whereas you have individuals who read world news, are aware of things going on in the world whether or not these things will affect them or not, they just want to be informed. It is hard to make these two people see eye to eye because one group watched the news one day a week, and one group is aware.I understand the viewpoint of not causing panic either, but simply acting as if there aren't a large group of people that have had their lives  changed, well this is flat out irresponsible to leave your society in the dark.

Worried about the coronavirus, the man decided to go to a Florida hospital to get tested, according to the Miami Herald. Testing revealed Mr Azcue had the flu, not the coronavirus. But his limited health insurance left him with a bill of $3,270 two weeks after his test. He will be responsible for $1,400 of that bill. Mr Azcue previously had insurance through the Affordable Care Act. **He picked that insurance as he makes $55,000 through his job at a medical-device company, and it does not provide a health insurance plan.**Once he first purchased the plan, he was paying $278 per month. These premiums then shot up to $400 once his full salary kicked in, forcing the man to cancel the coverage and pay $180 per month for a limited plan through National General Insurance. **Mr Azcue discovered that not only does he owe $1,400 out of pocket, but he also needs to provide his insurer with three years of medical records to prove that the flu he got didn't relate to a pre-existing condition.** If for some reason the flu related to a pre-existing condition, then the insurer would no longer pay a portion of the man's bill. **Jackson Memorial Hospital, where Mr Azcue received his tests, told the Miami Herald more bills are on its way to the man.** It is not clear what else he will have to pay for after getting tested for the coronavirus.","Coronavirus: Man receives $3,500 medical bill for test after returning to US from China.

Please let me explain with some references.We have very clear Hadith (speeches of prophet Muhammad) which is a source of ruling on what to do when there's an epidemic. **Usamah bin Zaid said: The Prophet said, ""If you hear about the outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it; and if it breaks out in a land in which you are, do not leave it.""**Ref: [https://sunnah.com/riyadussaliheen/18/282](https://sunnah.com/riyadussaliheen/18/282)I think it's very practical way of stopping epidemics. This is the guidance of Allah, to think practically before taking steps forward while claiming the trust in Allah to save us. Another Hadith on the same way of thinking (think and act logically and trust Allah).**Anas bin Malik narrated that a man said: ""O Messenger of Allah! Shall I tie it and rely(upon Allah), or leave it loose and rely(upon Allah)?"" He said: ""Tie it and rely(upon Allah).""**The man was asking about if he should not tie his camel and trust that Allah will save it, and the prophet told him to think practically to tie it and have trust in Allah. Islam is always like this balancing practice and spirituality, fear and hope, and so on. I do love this way balancing thingsRef: [https://sunnah.com/urn/727020](https://sunnah.com/urn/727020)Moreover, objectively speaking, and please feel free to ask for references. If the Chinese were following the teaching of Islam on hygiene, food, and how to act in such circumstances, the world could have been saved from facing such a hardship.If the Hajj is not cancelled, I think the strongest reason is the billions of dollars that flow into Saudi Arabia because of it.

This is the first clinical trial in the United States to evaluate an experimental treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory disease first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.The first trial participant is an American who was repatriated after being quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Yokohama, Japan and volunteered to participate in the study. The study can be adapted to evaluate additional investigative treatments and to enroll participants at other sites in the U.S. and worldwide.There are no specific therapeutics approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat people with COVID-19, the disease caused by the newly emergent SARS-CoV-2 virus (formerly known as 2019-nCoV). Infection can cause mild to severe respiratory illness, and symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. As of February 24, the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://proofpointisolation.com/browser?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Femergencies%2Fdiseases%2Fnovel-coronavirus-2019%2Fsituation-reports) has reported 77,262 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,595 deaths in China and 2,069 cases of COVID-19 and 23 deaths in 29 other countries. There have been 14 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in the United States and an additional 39 cases among persons repatriated to the United States, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://proofpointisolation.com/browser?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-in-us.html).Remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment. It was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has [shown promise in animal models for treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)](https://proofpointisolation.com/browser?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.niaid.nih.gov%2Fnews-events%2Fremdesivir-prevents-mers-coronavirus-disease-monkeys) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are caused by other coronaviruses.“We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. Although remdesivir has been administered to some patients with COVID-19, we do not have solid data to indicate it can improve clinical outcomes,” said NIAID Director and U.S. Coronavirus Task Force member Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is the gold standard for determining if an experimental treatment can benefit patients.”Clinical trials of remdesivir are also ongoing in China. NIAID developed the current study taking those designs into account, and in accordance with consultations convened by the WHO on the development of a therapeutic trial for patients with COVID-19.Participants in the NIH-sponsored trial must have laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and evidence of lung involvement, including rattling sounds when breathing (rales) with a need for supplemental oxygen or abnormal chest X-rays, or illness requiring mechanical ventilation. Individuals with confirmed infection who have mild, cold-like symptoms or no apparent symptoms will not be included in the study. In accordance with standard clinical research protocols, eligible patients will provide informed consent to participate in the trial.All potential participants will undergo a baseline physical exam before receiving treatment. Eligible study participants will then be randomly assigned either to the investigational treatment group or the placebo group. The study is double-blind, meaning trial investigators and participants would not know who is receiving remdesivir or placebo. Participants in the investigational treatment group will receive 200 milligrams (mg) of remdesivir intravenously on the first day of enrollment to the study. They will receive another 100 mg each day for the duration of hospitalization, for up to 10 days total. The placebo group will receive, at an equal volume, a solution that resembles remdesivir but contains only inactive ingredients.Clinicians will regularly monitor participants and will assign them daily scores based on a predefined scale of clinical outcomes that considers factors such as temperature, blood pressure and use of supplemental oxygen, among others. Participants also will be asked to provide blood samples and nose and throat swabs approximately every two days. Researchers will test these specimens for SARS-CoV-2.Initially, investigators will compare participant outcomes on day 15 in both the remdesivir group and the placebo group to see if the investigational drug increased clinical benefit compared to placebo. Outcomes are scored on a seven-point scale ranging from fully recovered to death. Investigators will reevaluate this scale after reviewing data from the first 100 participants. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will monitor ongoing results to ensure patient well-being and safety as well as study integrity. The DSMB will recommend the study be halted if there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference between drug and placebo.Andre Kalil, M.D., professor of internal medicine at UNMC and an infectious diseases physician at Nebraska Medicine, is leading the trial at UNMC. Thirteen people repatriated by the U.S. State Department from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were transported to the National Quarantine Unit, located within the Training, Simulation and Quarantine Center on the UNMC/Nebraska Medicine campus in Omaha on February 17, 2020. The passengers were in a close setting where there had been significant spread of COVID-19 and were sent to the unit for continued isolation and possibly further care. The CDC has since reported that 11 people in the UNMC unit have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.UNMC’s National Quarantine Unit is supported by the office of the [Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response](https://proofpointisolation.com/browser?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phe.gov%2Fabout%2Faspr%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx) (ASPR) at the Department of Health and Human Services. It has a 20-bed capacity and is in close proximity to the [Nebraska Biocontainment Unit](https://proofpointisolation.com/browser?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nebraskamed.com%2Fbiocontainment), should a higher level of care be needed. Clinical trial participants are cared for in the biocontainment unit.“We thank the individuals for their participation in this trial, and we are pleased that the NIH has chosen UNMC/Nebraska Medicine as the site for this important work,” said Dr. Kalil. “Our expertise in treating highly infectious disease — as well as our capacity to conduct leading-edge clinical trials — will ensure that this trial is carried out in the most effective manner possible.”For more information, visit ClinicalTrials.gov and search identifier [NCT04280705](https://proofpointisolation.com/browser?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04280705).NIAID conducts and supports research — at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide — to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.

fir9jil,-0.9828,-0.4215,"The spread of the new coronavirus has rattled investors in both the stock and bond markets.By Matt PhillipsFeb. 25, 2020Updated 2:37 p.m. ETWorried investors continued to dump stocks Tuesday in response to the threat of the spreading coronavirus outbreak, as American officials warned that it was only a matter of time before the infection spreads to the United States.A day after its worst one-day slide in two years, the S&P 500 was down nearly 3 percent by Tuesday afternoon, a decline that put the blue chip index firmly in the red for the year.For weeks, American investors had largely shrugged off the economic risks of the virus even as it disrupted global supply chains and shut down factories in China. As recently as last Wednesday, the S&P 500 was at a record high. But since then, growing outbreaks in Europe and elsewhere in Asia have raised fears that the virus will continue to drag on the global economy.Monday was the worst day for American markets since February 2018, with the S&P 500 falling 3.4 percent after officials in Italy and South Korea reported new infections.On Tuesday, the tumble continued. Declines in the S&P 500 were led by energy, industrial and materials shares, sectors of the market closely tied to Chinese demand for raw materials.The sell-off accelerated after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans that they should brace for the likelihood that the coronavirus will spread to communities in the United States.“It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more, but a question of when this will happen,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad.”As stocks dropped sharply, investors moved into the safety of government bonds, pushing their prices up and yields down. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.31 percent, which would be a record low, a possible sign that investors expect growth in the United States to slow.Investors could face more wild rides as the coronavirus outbreak spreads further, crimping consumer demand and snarling the world’s supply chains.“The emergence of a large number of new cases in Italy has materially increased the risk of a sharp drop in consumer and business confidence in Europe, and potentially North America too if more cases are confirmed there in the coming days,” Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS’s global wealth management operations, said in an investment report.The growing outbreaks of the virus in Europe, Asia and the Middle East have stoked fears that its spread will be difficult to contain, and market analysts in recent days have issued new warnings that the outbreak could drag down economies around the globe.Economists at JPMorgan Chase wrote that they expected global growth to slow to a 1 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year, which would be the weakest quarter of the economic expansion that is now more than a decade long. In the United States, the general estimate for first-quarter domestic growth has slipped.Markets around the globe have been affected this week.Germany’s DAX and Britain’s FTSE 100 each fell nearly 2 percent on Tuesday, a day after European markets had their worst drop since 2016.Shares also fell in most markets in Asia, led by Japan, which was closed for a holiday on Monday. The Nikkei 225 index tumbled more than 3.3 percent on Tuesday, although most other Asian markets fell at a much slower pace.South Korea, which is facing the world’s second-largest outbreak of the virus outside China, was the bright spot: Share prices rebounded on Tuesday morning after enduring one of the sharpest drops of any large market around the world the day before. They ended up 1.2 percent.Stock markets in commodity-exporting countries continued to suffer losses as traders worry that demand for their goods may decline if more countries suffer the kind of bruising deceleration in economic activity that China has endured. Australia’s stock market fell 1.6 percent on Tuesday.The price of a barrel of benchmark American crude oil dropped more than 1 percent, to less than $51 on Tuesday. Oil prices have dropped about 17 percent this year, as investors have anticipated the weekslong immobilization of China’s economy, the world’s second largest.China consumes more crude and commodities than any other country. Prices of those commodities have also fallen, dragging down the share prices of mining, chemical and fertilizer companies.Keith Bradsher and Jeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",Stocks Tumble Again as Fears of Coronavirus Grip Markets (Story update at 2:38pmEST),2020-02-25 11:40:36,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9ftgc/stocks_tumble_again_as_fears_of_coronavirus_grip/

firp09g,0.9477,0.4417,"I came across this publication recently, which had a pretty interesting note about where and why the suspension of airborne particles can be much greater in some unexpected settings like hospitals.https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3707-y> One should note that “aerosol” is essentially a relative and not an absolute term. A larger droplet can remain airborne for longer if ambient airflows can sustain this suspension for longer, e.g. in some strong cross-flow or natural ventilation environments, where ventilation-induced airflows can propagate suspended pathogens effectively enough to cause infection at a considerable distance away from the source.> One of the standard rules (Stoke’s Law) applied in engineering calculations to estimate the suspension times of droplets falling under gravity with air resistance, was derived assuming several conditions including that the ambient air is still. **So actual suspension times will be far higher where there are significant cross-flows, which is often the case in healthcare environments, e.g. with doors opening, bed and equipment movement, and people walking back and forth, constantly.** Conversely, suspension times, even for smaller droplet nuclei, can be greatly reduced if they encounter a significant downdraft (e.g. if they pass under a ceiling supply vent)","COVID-19 transmitted in aerosol “in certain conditions” (like hospital during procedure, patient sneezes really hard, high concentration for a long time)- Arirang News (South Korea)-02/25/2020",2020-02-25 13:06:55,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9h7tl/covid19_transmitted_in_aerosol_in_certain/

Within the document itself there's links to other live documents. As it says in its executive summary it's a live document and is currently in use.The concept of activation is no longer used, the idea is that emergency plans are always active and now go through an escalation and escalation process that occurs through identified triggers. This means that there no longer has to be a formal activation of a plan, which used to be the case. The triggers are also more clearly articulated, for example one of the reasons that this new plan has been developed is to specify the exact triggers that will move the stage - declaration by WHO of a pandemic (or PHEIC) or sustained community transmission. The operation aspects in Part 2 have been translated to COVID19 response from the AHMPPI so they are more specific to this disease.When reading this the thing to remember is that Australia started as 6 colonies becoming a Federation and powers were deliberately kept seperate in most areas, including Health. So the Federal Government has very little control over State Health. This means that each State uses the AHMMPI as a basis for their own Pandemic Influenza Plans. The new COVID19 Plan allows them to work off the existing AHMPPI framework without having to recreate all their own detail - the COVID19 plan fits neatly over existing emergency structures.We know the actual structures, independent of the political structures, work because we've dealt with numerous natural and human disasters that have effectively operationalised the plans as the Pandemic Plans work within the EMPLANs (Emergency Plans). The Pandemic Plans change the lead response agency from the Firies or the Police to Health. All the structures and processes stay the same - there are still Operational Centres but these now operate under Health lead with involvement from the other agencies as support. During the recent bushfires the Ops Centres operated under the lead of the Firies with Health as a support agency.The parts of the Plan that are likely to change all the time, such as clinical guidelines or case definitions, are generally placed outside the plan but referred to within the plan - such as SoNGs (Series of National Guidelines). This allows them to be updated without having to constantly revise the main plan.",Australia activates emergency response plan amid rising concerns of coronavirus pandemic,2020-02-25 14:48:46,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9iuyy/australia_activates_emergency_response_plan_amid/

fis0mi7,0.81,0.34,"FAIRFIELD, Calif. — Four patients with newly confirmed cases of coronavirus [COVID-19] are now receiving treatment at Northern California hospitals, a CDC spokesperson confirms.These four patients are Americans who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and brought to Travis Air Force Base in Solano County for a 14-day period of quarantine. On Monday afternoon, CDC officials said test results came back positive for four of the evacuees staying at Travis. Hours later, they were taken to hospitals in Napa, Sonoma and Contra Costa counties.That brings the total number of Diamond Princess passengers evacuated to Travis Air Force Base who then tested positive for the coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, to 19. Of those 19, 15 patients — including the four newest cases — are in Northern California hospitals, spread over several counties. The remaining four were taken to medical facilities in the Spokane, Wash.CDC spokesperson Scott Pauley said patients are going to hospitals across several counties ""to make sure the burden doesn’t overwhelm Solano County’s"" health services and system. This also isn't impacting the number of beds for regular hospital patients.""COVID-19 patients require specialized isolation rooms where the average hospital patient would not stay,"" Pauley said. He also explained by spreading the patients across multiple counties, the CDC isn't expanding the risk of exposure because every hospital, ""has CDC protocols in place."" ""Nobody in the community or hospitals are at heightened risk,"" Pauley added.The CDC expects more test results soon from those who were evacuated to Travis AFB",Four new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Northern California; the patients include Americans who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and brought to Travis Air Force Base in Solano County for a 14-day period of quarantine.,2020-02-25 15:50:25,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9jspz/four_new_cases_of_coronavirus_have_been_confirmed/

Some additional testing is performed at selected state and other public health laboratories, with confirmatory testing at CDC. CDC is developing a serologic test to assist with surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the U.S. population. The test detects antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig]G, IgA, and IgM) indicating SARS-COV-2 virus exposure or past infection. In addition, CDC laboratories are developing assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and antigens in tissue specimens. Finally, following CDC’s establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture, CDC shared virus isolates with the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository to securely distribute isolates to U.S. public health and academic institutions for additional research, including vaccine development.So a total of 1007 people have been tested in the US.","As CDC warns of US COVID-19 spread, labs frustrated over lack of tests",2020-02-25 16:28:27,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9kc8c/as_cdc_warns_of_us_covid19_spread_labs_frustrated/

The tweet from BNO does not state a source or how many are critical vs serious based on the previous designations we have heard, though I imagine it is from the NHK article posted earlier. Unfortunately that article is also vague in its determination of serious vs critical. Based on the [tweets from the Minister of Defense](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9a5f4/statistics_from_japan_minister_of_defense/) there were 14 confirmed to be in what we would call ""critical"" condition, however there are also 39 unknown. Unfortunately without knowing the details of those remaining 39 its hard to tell what this number really means.The good news is that even if they are all in critical condition, that puts us only at 5% rate of critical condition, in line with what we have seen before. Beyond that though there is quite a bit of evidence to support these 50 representing both serious *and* critical cases, meaning that both serious and critical case rates are significantly lower than previosly reported (5% and around 1-2% respectively). And this is among a cohort of primarily elderly patients. That all sounds a bit too good to be true, especially based off a few tweets, but is something to consider. Unfortunately it is *also* quite early and we still have more individuals getting sick-- we may see some people make a turn for the worse in the next few weeks inflating these numbers.","NEW: At least 50 people with coronavirus in Japan are seriously ill, including 36 people from the cruise ship - NHK",2020-02-25 16:28:41,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9kcc9/new_at_least_50_people_with_coronavirus_in_japan/

In dire shortage situations, masks can be reused and worn more than once. While this in not ideal at all, it can be done if you're extremely careful not to infect yourself taking them on and off. In addition, UV-C light can be used to treat masks and help kill viruses on them as well (note: these are the same kind of mercury bulbs used for water treatment). When used on masks, these do deteriorate the masks and performance a bit over time, but actually affects the straps more than the masks.

All that I have heard about their response has been what I think an intelligent group of scientifically minded people would do to stop the spread.  Kudos, Singapore.  I wish the rest of us could have done so well.  Instead Trump proposed a budget which cuts funding to the CDC a few weeks ago during the budding phases of the outbreak during which he routinely under quoted the number of cases in the US (example if it was 5 and a 6th case had been announced earlier in the day he would not mention the 6th.  Either was not being briefed or deliberately understated.  Either reason is worrisome).  About 12 days ago, Trump also talked to Xi (supreme communist leader or whatever in China) and said China will win against coronavirus on Twitter.  Why the hell was advising him?  Granted I have a doctorate, but I am no genius, and I have been predicting this shit based on science and poor containment for weeks.  Who the hell is advising our president?  I am so tired of the “it’s just like the flu.”  Or Trump saying the virus is under control just yesterday.  It is clearly not. I’m not suggesting we panic, but approach it like Singapore.  They even told their people when the numbers were climbing that there was a possibility (and they were not there yet) of it becoming so widespread that they would ask people well enough to stay home allowing those who needed emergent care to be at the hospital.  The beauty of truth and science.  God, I love it.The irony here is that this virus isn’t the end of the world, but the response to it has shown some serious problems we have dealing with large problems that require working together, an interdisciplinary approach, and intelligence.  Singapore has done this, but most of the world has failed to.","Covid-19 beyond containment, but Singapore's efforts will slow the spread: Harvard",2020-02-25 17:27:28,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9l5we/covid19_beyond_containment_but_singapores_efforts/
fishf6x,-0.862,0.0,"Full article below:SINGAPORE - The coronavirus outbreak has gone beyond the point of containment, said a Harvard don.""I think the virus is already spreading rapidly and actively in many places,"" said Professor Marc Lipsitch, director of the Centre for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.He told The Straits Times: ""It seems extremely unlikely that the virus will be contained.""More than 80,000 people worldwide have been infected in the Covid-19 outbreak and about 3,000 have died. This is already far more than the previous two coronavirus outbreaks - severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) - combined.Covid-19 infections already spread to more than 30 countries worldwide so far.For other countries, it’s a matter of “when and not if” they will be hit, said visiting professor Tikki Pang at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore. “I think the genie is out of the bottle and containment is out of the question,” he added. “It’s now a matter of how more widely it spreads and having countries not yet affected be prepared for appearance of cases.”While he thinks the outbreak has peaked in China and Singapore, it “may just be the beginning” for countries like Italy, Korea and Iran. Numbers have exploded recently in countries like South Korea and Italy, with more than 900 and 200 infected respectively. Both countries have had seven deaths. Prof Lipsitch thinks this may happen in other countries too. He said: ""In most countries, there is not much testing of infections unless they have connections to known cases or to China.""His team from the school had upset Indonesian authorities by suggesting in a paper published earlier this month that countries like Indonesia and Thailand are probably missing cases, as the number reported are below expected levels, given their connection with China, and the number of infections that have been picked up by Singapore.The team had used Singapore as the upper limit of case detection capacity, and said other countries' detection ranged from 11 to 40 per cent of Singapore's efforts.The paper, which has not been peer reviewed, concluded that for each detected case outside of China, 1.8 cases go undetected.Singapore now has 90 cases, and close to 3,000 people who may have been infected by these patients have been put under 14 days of quarantine in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.Travellers returning from China are also required to comply with a 14-day stay-home notice.Prof Lipsitch had predicted earlier this month that the virus is out of control and about half the world's population will likely be infected within the coming year, though many will have the disease in a mild form.Asked if all Singapore has been doing has been is a waste of effort if the virus cannot be contained, Prof Pang gave an emphatic “definitely not” in response. “The key priority is to control the situation in Singapore - the global spread is a natural consequence of these kinds of events and there is nothing Singapore can do about it. At the same time, Singapore’s experience will provide valuable lessons for other countries.”Concurring, Prof Lipsitch said Singapore’s efforts will slow the spread, and “delay is good”. He explained that delaying the spread of the virus in the country is good for at least four reasons:- Fewer individuals get infected in total in a slower-moving epidemic;- The burden on the health system is spread out, with lower peak demand for scarce resources;- We will know more as time goes by, on about how to care for patients. So it is better to get the disease late than early;- If we can slow the spread long enough, there may be new drugs, vaccines, or other countermeasures to aid in preventing and treating infection.Prof Pang said he is particularly worried about hidden cases in countries with fragile healthcare systems such as Africa. Singapore and the rest of the world can take steps to prepare countries with weak healthcare systems for introduction of the virus. ","Covid-19 beyond containment, but Singapore's efforts will slow the spread: Harvard",2020-02-25 17:27:28,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9l5we/covid19_beyond_containment_but_singapores_efforts/

fiskwsg,0.8992,0.0,"There are definitely pro-China people on here, but there are also people just trying to be reasonable. I live in Beijing (have for 10 years) and if you aren’t here or haven’t done intense research you can’t really know the situation on the ground. People have been on lockdown since Chinese New Year (late January). If you come back to Beijing from out of town you are not allowed out of your community, you have to go to the local community police station and register to prove you have been here 2 weeks and then you can get a card which allows you to leave your community. No one goes out at all, bars, restaurants, movie theaters, etc are all closed. People who are not allowed out have help from the community in delivering groceries to their doors. While the amount of confirmed cases is suspiciously low, I believe it is not only due to underreporting (of which there surely is some) but rather because many people are either asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. A friend of mine in wuhan had it and had what felt like a cold, so I assume many cases go undiagnosed. Surely the Chinese government could have dealt with it better at the beginning, but a lot of that is due to the disconnect between localities and the central government. Unfortunately the way the system works is that it is often better for localities to hide problems than report them, which gets everyone into trouble if it spirals out of control. However, once the central government gets involved they normally want to go in and do damage control and in this case they have. Do I believe there were 0 cases in Beijing for the past couple days? Probably not. Do I think there are thousands of cases in Beijing daily? Also no.

(Not sure what this allowance is though)2. Make sure recognition of work injuries is prompt and under no scrutiny so they get insurance payment in time.3. Fast track of professional title advancement. For those who are not familiar with the professional title system in China, this is actually significant. A freshly graduated medical undergrad need *at least* 15 years to become a Chief Physician(5 years for an MD). For people participating in fighting this virus, this policy takes one year off that and put them on the top of the list.4. Provide them and their families with decent food, supply and residence (which is long overdue I believe).5. Provide them with sufficient essential PPE (also long overdue). And treat the infected healthcare workers with the best treatment possible.6. Rotate shifts. 7. Provide psychological intervention.8. Provide (financial?) assistance to their families.

(Patients sometimes panic and attack the doctors.)One may think this doc is too general and does not provide any detail for implementing these policies.

fisjc9k,0.8659,0.0772,"Great question. This is at the top of many of our minds.  It's frustrating when you post a reasonable observation and you just get the same irrelevant response over and over (""if you aren't testing..."").There has certainly been some unknown community transmission within the US and Canada.  It appears that any clusters thus far have either not been self-sustaining or not prolonged enough to trigger enough serious cases that are caught through hospital surveillance (as you point out, a cluster of pneumonia without influenza).My opinion is that it is still too premature to answer you question. In January, it seemed like we would know by the end of February but we still don't....  It's frustrating, isn't it? I thought the same and we just have to be patient. If anything, not having an answer about which way this will go does give me some reassurance.

fiska65,0.5106,0.5994,"China has done the impossible and curbed a highly infectious disease early, something even experts have had trouble believing until they went and saw it themselves. According to Bruce Aylward, China has a 5 point system that they applied throughout their health system when the outbreak was declared, based on some key concepts of quarantine, containment, contact tracing, and social distancing:1. Lateral organisation - every part of the system, from the national to state to the district and local, was reformed and organised to fight the coronavirus. New guidelines and manuals are published every single week in how to best to tackle the virus, and individuals on the ground are adapting it to their local situations.2. Multi-institutional “war” footing - the state reacted as if in a war, and mobilised their entire bureaucracy to dealing with the virus. Different ministries that had different expertises or different access to goods or materials were included to best utilise resources and simplify delivering on targets and goals. Hospitals are put up in weeks, beds and equipment rolled out all over, masks being made, etc.3. Radical technology - China has been utilising the latest in technological innovations, such as complex AI that does statistical modelling and analysis. The entire country is online, which has enabled them to isolate millions of people yet still provide them with services and information. Massive logistical undertaking utilising the ubiquitousness of smartphones and 4g/5g. As a result, they and healthcare workers get almost live updates and information, as well as advanced data modelling and being able to fully understand the virus and how it operates. Instead of seeing it as “SARS” or as “Flu”, China is seeing it for what it is: a novel, never seen before, unknown coronavirus. China has also been at the forefront of utilising big data on contact tracing.4. National unity - Chinese citizens have willfully complied with quarantine and lockdowns. Everyone is “in” on preventing this virus spreading and acting together as a society. This quarantine is unprecedented in world history and speaks to the discipline and mentality of the Chinese that they all willingly stayed home to defeat the virus. Social distancing is also keenly applied which people are following, where you keep 2 meters apart at all times. Aylward worries that social unrest and the public not following along with the government is more likely in other countries than in China, where the key to success was a compliant citizenry who accepted the situation. 5. Adaptability/Flexibility - While there are central guidelines updated weekly, and a structure and organisation from the top-down, what struck Aylward repeatedly was how everything is flexible enough to be adapted on the local level to local needs. Instead of exhausting the medical system by having the same response throughout the country, each district was essentially tailored to utilise parts of the guidelines that were needed for their own situation. This was found throughout, a high degree of flexibility so not everything followed a rigid system. The basics and fundamentals were all there throughout the different healthcare systems that were looked at, but highly tailored.Hope this summary helps.",What does it look like inside Wuhan right now?

fisw1be,0.9852,-0.8205,"I think what you need to do when you find yourself panicking is to take a step back, breathe, count to 10, and then re-assess the situation. The way how I handle this situation is to break it up into different steps from best case scenario from what we know to worst case.  Step 1 is how to mitigate what you know is coming.  Do you know there will be a supply shortage or people mass-buying out of fear?  If so, you may want to get some necessities that you need to have for the next 3-4 weeks. These are the absolute must-haves, like medicines, or diapers, or formula (if you use that).  If you have running water and it seems to work fine, I wouldn't concern yourself with blowing your budget on bottled water.  The threat itself is not poisoning your water source, so there's no need.  Toilet Paper though?  I'd make sure you have enough to cover you and your family for a month at a minimum.  Also you might want to get disinfectant spray and hand sanitizer. I'm sure you already have some in your house but good to have enough to keep your frequently-touched surfaces sanitized daily throughout a month.I think when you have those needs fulfilled, it will be easier to sleep at night with this around. Make sure your family is aware of the changes and to reinforce good hygiene practices.When you get to this time, you should be thinking about how to react if you need to step up your game and take more precautions to prep (such as buying bottled water, storing of foods to stay at home for a x-length of time, etc).  When that moment is about to come and you sense it is on the horizon with what news you have, then take that leap and start preparing for that situation.  Once that is done, repeat the process and think about reacting to the next higher level of problematic situation with this coronavirus.This way, you only spend your money on the important things to keep you calm and mentally fit for the current situation you find yourself in.I hope this helps.",Should Canadians start prepping for the worst?

Beans are protein, rice is carb. If you can buy a family pack of chicken breasts you can boil the breasts in water, use a fork to shred them, and freeze a lot of that to pull out portions to add to your rice. Buy a bottle of italian salad dressing, put some of that on top. You could do this whole paragraph for about 15 dollars max. Do you know how to bake? If you don't then look up recipes online. Bisquick is super simple to work with, buy a bag of sugar, a big bag of frozen fruit, you can make cobbler for weeks with this. You can do this paragraph for about 10 dollars, depending on the kind of frozen fruit you buy. So it depends on what you want to eat, but you should do the beans and rice if that's all you have funds for because you don't need dessert to survive.

For over the counter medicines, get an extra bottle of a fever reducer/pain med like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Grab guaifenesin (Mucinex) or a cold/flu multisymptom product that includes it (whatever you normally get if you take that kind of stuff). Get a thermometer for taking your temp at home if you don't have one already (assuming you do with kids, but just in case). Grab an extra pack of toilet paper, extra tube of toothpaste, etc. Extra diapers, etc for the kids.For food, the best thing to do is try to stock up on nonperishable food that you usually eat. Stuff like rice, beans, crackers, peanut butter, canned/frozen veg, cereal are all great things. You can start by just buying one extra or double the amount you usually do for each trip to the grocery store. Also don't forget to toss in some comfort/snack food!That's it!

The agencies are saying they aren’t effective for containment on a population level, this is because coronavirus is highly transmissible and people will mostly face transmission through surface to face transmission / poor use of disinfectants / not limiting exposure. Expert view to masks ineffective: coronavirus protein capsid is 0.125um size, smaller than masks can filter, but this is wrong. Coronavirus is a membrane encapsulated virus, meaning it exits through the cell’s endoplasmic reticulum / golgi and maintains a membrane outside the protein capsid. Hydrophobicity on this scale means the membrane will be surrounded by water. Yes these droplets are small enough to become airborne, or aerosolized. However, they are large enough to be stopped by masks. A mask will stop coronavirus on almost all counts, you just need to wear it properly and accompany it with proper disinfection and sterilization procedures as you take it off. Buy nitrile gloves, triple glove and disinfect layers as you disrobe, and then disinfect the mask, it will save you if you do it properly.","CDC's guidance for reusing N95 masks, because I've seen people say they are one-use only",2020-02-25 21:31:31,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9oey4/cdcs_guidance_for_reusing_n95_masks_because_ive/

Idk the best way as it really isn’t a researched topic (usually just say to throw it out for sterility, but that won’t be the real world situation in a crisis when masks are limited). I can’t give an educated best answer about the materials science behind it, but I’d lean toward soaking in 0.5% bleach or gentle washing in warm water with gloves on. It’s not a great option in the long run as it will degrade, but for maybe a week+ with no other options it should stay effective. I have a P100 reusable respirator, but I would wear a bandana over it to minimize contamination as the bandana is easier to clean. Will still sterilize the respirator, but if you need to reuse a mask it should help to have a layer over it that you can decontaminate in stronger fluid and minimize damage to the reusable mask by catching most contamination on the outer layer. Again, this is speculation given BSL2 and decon training and a lack of real studies, so I cannot give you a sure answer, this is just what I would do.","CDC's guidance for reusing N95 masks, because I've seen people say they are one-use only",2020-02-25 21:31:31,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9oey4/cdcs_guidance_for_reusing_n95_masks_because_ive/

fit4tza,0.9011,-0.3182,"(Seoul: Yonhap News) Reporter Yang Jung-Woo has alleged that the explanation of the Shinchonji Jesus Christ Evidence Tabernacle (Shincheonji) that there is no church in Wuhan, China, where the new coronavirus infection (Corona 19) originated, was false.  On the 26th, the YouTube channel 'Mamallon Office' released the sermon transcript of the James of Busan, one of the 12 tribes of the Sincheonji General Assembly, through a video called 'Inquiry for the arrest of the Shinchonji leadership'.  Busan's James tribe is known as the place of management of Wuhan, China, in Shinchonji.According to this transcript, James said in a sermon to Shincheonji believers on September 9, saying, ""You have Wuhan pneumonia. That's where our local church is."" ""Over 700 people died in China. ""The source is where our local church is located."" Then he said, ""But our saints didn't take one."" The supposed believers shouted ""Amen"" and cheered and applauded. The tribe emphasized, ""Thank you. If we stand right, if we stand in faith in faith, God will protect and protect us.""Shincheonji has a church in Wuhan where believers have come into Korea and the corona 19 infection has spread.  Even after the Xintiandi General Assembly data on the 235 Xintiandi Church members in Wuhan were released, the group has maintained that ""the saints are right,"" but ""the Chinese government did not authorize the church.""  The apocalyptic office urges, 'Intentionally concealing and distorting the information, causing confusion in the government's response, and requesting the arrest of the Shinchonji leadership who is indifferent to the safety and life of the Korean people.'
