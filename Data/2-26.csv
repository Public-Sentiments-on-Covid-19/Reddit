fitey49,-0.8856,-0.3875,"Once anger and disbelief subsided I started to think about it. We almost habitually think of Iran's leaders as idiots and criminals. I guess this is a bit of cognitive bias, because even being a criminal doesn't imply being an idiot and surely not everyone in the leadership of a great nation like Iran is intellectually deficient. So lets for  a moment put emotions aside and consider it with an assumption that this is a coldly made decision that seems rational to whoever took it. Maybe their thinking goes as  follows: this virus kills less than 2% of people, mostly elderly and already not in their best health. Trying to contain it by strong quarantines like ones we see in China or Italy would seriously disrupt the country (already suffering economic problems due to sanctions). This in turn could lead not only to other deaths and suffering, but also to unrest and regime change. Therefore, not implementing such measures - effectively allowing the virus to spread fast - would just lead to some deaths, possibly fewer deaths than from other causes within same time span, but the country would continue to operate. This logic is raising my hair with its cruelty, but nevertheless it is logical. So it might be more than them just being stupid, it might be a calculated gamble that the country - and therefore the regime - would be better off with the infection that it would have been with the countermeasures.",Iranian President Rouhani: We will not quarantine any city and the people should not care about rumors,2020-02-26 02:19:41,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9r72v/iranian_president_rouhani_we_will_not_quarantine/

In countries where more cases are confirmed in a reactive manner (likely sicker patients further into disease progression) the discharge rates would understandably be lower because the cases are simply sicker on average.

fityyk4,0.8693,0.5511,"Not mixing the two up but this virus has the worst of everything. it seems to be extremely long lived on surfaces at room temperature. It's airborne as well. it's easily absorbed through the mucous membranes or the eyes. It's highly transmissible. 25% of a cruise ship under cabin lockdown for some of that period got infected. This thing travels and it does suggest airborne is a significant means of infection. Yes you didn't  say soap was the magic medicine but worth pointing out that you're as or more likely to get it from the air. Just as effective as washing hands would be avoiding touching surfaces you don't have to, including people, or surfaces that other people touch, like door handles. then any form of touching the face, which people do many times an hour on average, should be avoided. If you're not touching your face then washing your hands before eating or handling things that will go near your face like food should be effective.  But just on a physical level I'm not convinced that washing with any amount of soap or water would remove *all* viruses from a surface. It doesn't remove all bacteria. These are very small things and there are many places they can hide and stick on a craggy surface like skin.   I read the link but it doesn't appear to be written by a doctor, could be a 20 year old intern.

fitnqn6,-0.993,-0.5994,">Some medical institutions in Japan have been rejecting possible COVID-19 patients under the strict but ambiguous testing guidelines currently in place, leaving many patients shunted from hospital to hospital.>Experts point out that the vague criteria have caused confusion among medical staff.>According to the health ministry, eligibility for the test is limited to two groups of people; those who have come into close contact with patients confirmed as infected with the new virus, and those who have traveled recently to infected areas in China, have a fever of at least 37.5 degrees Celsius and have pneumonia-like symptoms that require hospitalization.>But the final decision on whether to test a patient is also “up to the doctor’s overall judgment.”>A government worker in his 30s who lives in Tokyo visited a hospital after his temperature rose to 39 degrees on Feb. 17. When he mentioned that he had recently visited Taiwan, he was advised to go to a dedicated COVID-19 consultation center.>The center told him that visitors to Taiwan were not eligible for the test. After being refused by two more hospitals due to reasons such as inadequate facilities, he was finally seen by a doctor at a general hospital where he took a lung X-ray. He was given the all-clear.>“I suppose it couldn’t be helped” with the ongoing spread of the virus, he said.>A 29-year-old male company employee in Tokyo called the COVID-19 consultation center after developing a fever of 39 degrees on Feb. 12 as well as feeling lethargic and having diarrhea. He had recently been in contact with a person who had traveled to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.>The center told him to visit a local hospital because he had not had close contact with the individual with Wuhan travel history. He was then refused by a hospital in Tokyo, but was later able to see a doctor at a hospital that specializes in treating infections.>Symptoms of infection with the novel coronavirus may be difficult to distinguish from those of other illnesses, and it is said that most cases of infection do not become severe.>“It’s likely that many people have recovered without even realizing they’d been infected,” said an official at a disease control authority in Chiba Prefecture.>A Chiba woman in her 70s who on Feb. 20 was found to have been infected had previously been told to note her symptoms, but had not been tested.

Dispute with hospital if anything doesn’t look right on their end. Make sure everything is coded correctly. Ask about bill pay assistance. Ask for a payment plan, tell them how much you can pay a month instead of letting them tell you how much you should pay a month. Ask for a discount for putting down a down payment on a payment plan. Ask for a discount or make an offer for paying in full immediately (ex offer $1,200 on the $1,400 bill). If you require medications, always talk to the dr about options. Sometimes, it’s better to ask the dr to prescribe you the newest drug available if the manufacturer is offering copay assistance. Ex. You need a medication and dr prescribes you an older generic. It’s costs $40/month. Dr. Prescribes newer medication that costs $60/month, but they have a copay card where you only pay $10/month. Depending on your insurance plan, the entire $60, even though you only paid $10 counts toward your deductible and out of pocket expenses if your plan counts copays. Not all plans do. - Warning with this, even if your insurance plan counts copays towards your deductible, some insurance plans are moving to where if you use a copay card, what the drug manufacturer pays with the copay card doesn’t count toward your deductible or out of pocket expenses. So they would only count the $10 you pay, not the $50 the drug company paid. Drug manufacturers are getting around this by offering a debit card in your name - ask for for this option if your insurance plan has moved to a “co-pay accumulator plan”.","Man receives $3,500 medical bill for coronavirus test after returning to US from China",2020-02-26 06:04:55,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9toq0/man_receives_3500_medical_bill_for_coronavirus/

I'd imagine that jobs will be lost, bills not paid, and homes may be lost..  it's terrible to think about the implications.But, I will say that I've never been happier to be a Dave Ramsey nut than right now.   My wife and I are 100% debt free for the last 3 years now using his plan.  I always felt it would be good insurance in case of job loss or another recession.  Its also given us some freedom to do what we want to do.    But, that said, I never ever envisioned this sort of thing coming...    Over the last 7+ years we've been made fun of by friends and some family members treat us as pariahs for how we choose to live frugally without debt, but I guess this event might make many realize just how important keeping your financial house in order really is.That said, we will be fine no matter what happens.    We are 100% debt free with a paid off house and cars, no credit card debt, a 6 month emergency fund in the bank, an account fully funded for property taxes, and what utility bills we have are paid in advance at least a month or two.   We have 3-6 month supply of food and necessities on hand for us as well as all our pets so we can wait this out if we need to and resume life like nothing happened out the other end of this. If God forbid one of us gets sick and doesnt make it, the survivor will never have to work again with insurance we've taken out on each other.  Years ago, I wanted to make sure that no matter what, my loved ones would be cared for, and I can't begin to explain the peace of mind this brings me right now.I highly recommend that everyone takes a close look at the principles and methodology that Dave Ramsey teaches and look into applying them to your daily lives.

I know surgical masks are most useful for protecting others from oneself so that was nice. (They provided the masks right up front by the door.)My daughter and I avoided touching anything we didn't absolutely have to and refrained from touching our faces.

Very generally speaking, the R0 is a value that describes (in a mathematical model) the potency of an infection to spread through a model population. It can vary somewhat from population to population, depending on customs like kissing on greeting or use of packed subways, but it's generally fairly constant and not subject to change. The R0 is different from the R, or actual reproduction value. This is the resulting reproduction value of an infection where human interventions (like quarantine, temperature checks, etc) and natural immunity come into play.Dr Campbell (doctor of what exactly? I hope not medicine) keeps using the R0 value when he is talking about the R value, for instance when he is describing the R0 value in China to have dropped  to 1.2 (a number he seems to have pulled out of a dark orifice) because of the quarantine. There are more examples in the video but that one popped out the most.Another example of incompetence is his inability to interpret non peer reviewed articles. His insistence on drawing conclusions from papers that don't support those conclusions and then not adding a sufficient (or any!) disclaimer.Please don't use his rambling as an actual credible source.",Dr. John Campbell's videos covering COVID-19 is a good source of evidence based tracking of the disease.,2020-02-26 07:35:53,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9uzld/dr_john_campbells_videos_covering_covid19_is_a/

Wuhan of course) and also stopped issuing temporary travel visa to any Chinese. However, they continue to permit Chinese nationals who already had valid visas (working or student or etc) from other parts of the mainland China to enter into Korea. They also created a separate entrance for Chinese flying into Korea.While not imposing harsh travel ban was not helping growing fear among Korean citizens, there are only 6 Chinese confirmed patients in Korea up to date and Chinese neighborhoods are free of the outbreak.Honestly, the conservative party is using this blame to shift attention away from their dirty association with Shincheonji Cult.[https://news.joins.com/article/23695864](https://news.joins.com/article/23695864)","Meanwhile in SK, over 730,000(870,000 now) people signed on the petition calling for the impeachment of president Moon, blaming the Coronavirus situation on him, especially for not banning Chinese.",2020-02-26 07:45:04,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9v4f3/meanwhile_in_sk_over_730000870000_now_people/

Her and her husband have been getting worse and worse, they went to the hospital this weekend, they were tested for a BACTERIAL infection even though they have a bad cough and shortness of breath and a fever. They were both sent home because its not bacterial. She came to work, Monday and said she felt terrible, she came to work Tuesday and said she felt worse and everyone in the office made her go home.

fiun8j5,-0.7252,0.6124,"Wow, this is great anecdote that I can't help but call out as completely made up.Tested for bacterial infection? How would they go about doing that? And why would they, its flu and cold season. If they suscepted a bacterial infection was causing a fever and cough they would warrant a pneumonia diagnosis and hospital time, not send them home lol.Likely they weren't tested for anything (if said people even exist) because, as maybe you forgot, we are in flu season. Cough and fevers are a dime a dozen. You go to a doctor with a flu symptoms you will be treated like you have flu and sent away. Only those with severe signs of corona like viral pneumonia of the upper and lower tracts would be tested, but again we haven't seen those cases yet.Are you really suggesting we start testing everyone that comes in with a cold for corona?

fivdu6d,-0.9506,0.6124,"Well, if you look at my post history you can get a pretty clear understanding that I am not one to post a lot or fabricate stories for karma points. And you dont have to be such a condescending asshole about your analysis - you actually dont know everything about everything so settle down there buck, you are making a lot of assumptions and you are not good at it. I didnt ask her how they went about testing, because believe it or not she was sick and really wasnt into talking and spilling her guts about her doctor visit. I asked her on Monday if she had been to the doctor to get medication because she was getting worse, and she said she went this weekend with her husband, ""but they just tested me for some bacterial infection and I didnt have anything so they just sent me home."" Those were her words, now she is not the smartest person on the planet so perhaps she just mis-spoke and meant to say viral but she didnt which is why I though the whole thing was weird to begin with - which is why I capitalized that part because it makes no sense. It seems no one is using common sense ...Keep in mind the US transferred people who tested positive for the virus but weren't showing any symptoms WITH the people who tested negative and for some reason the ""experts"" thought this was ok - so it's not it's not a stretch that swamped LPNs in a minute clinic might make mistakes too. My confidence on the abilities of medical staff in general have dwindled. My co-worker also said they had a ridiculous amount of people in the waiting room and they had to wait for hours, so I am assuming they arent getting great care because the hospital is already swamped. Now no where in my post did I say they should be testing everyone with cold or flu like symptoms. But when you have been sick for over two weeks and are getting sicker, AND prior to being sick you were on a boat with people from all over the world including China, I just think you are at a higher risk than people that just have cold symptoms and I think that those people should be tested. It is cheaper to test people and prevent spread than to have to treat 20% of the people who contracted for pneumonia. And I dont even know what costs have to do with anything I said - but with your assumptions and poor analysis skills, you should look into working for WHO, I am sure they would love the help.",The US has started human testing of a drug to treat the novel coronavirus,2020-02-26 07:47:46,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9v5uz/the_us_has_started_human_testing_of_a_drug_to/

He believes that he can hear a pattern in it, but none of his older colleagues can hear it. Taylor's younger sister, Joyce Taylor (Kirsten Dunst), plays the tape and enjoys the sound so much she plays it at a rave. When Devon finds her at the rave, everyone there is infected with skin deformities. All the teens are quarantined at a hospital, but when they are separated from the music on the tape they all experience severe pain and withdrawal symptoms. Devon and his superiors are left with no choice but to let the patients listen to the tape until they can figure out the rest of the transmitted message. It is later discovered that a dying alien world had transmitted this audio in order to save other planets from a dire fate: their sun had shifted to the ultraviolet spectrum, and all their world's inhabitants would have died if they had not figured out how to alter their own physiology so that they would resist the effects of the changed sun. They detected that Earth's sun would also undergo the same change and sent the audio signal to Earth so that humanity could prepare. In the end the rest of humanity either transforms by the transmitted sound (developing new, hardened skin) or chose to remain as they were. Any humans who did not change would have to avoid the sun at all times since the new sun's radiation would be fatal to anyone who did not change..",The coronavirus seems unstoppable.

fiubusy,-0.9817,-0.6142,"  I believe most of the blame is that of governments, which are obsessed with the ""Don't panic message"", instead of helping people cope with a likely grave situation. People follow blindly what their being told, precisely because it's what they wish that was real. They buy the ""It's less than the flu"", ""Everything is fine"", because they don't want to be scared, and would rather believe a happy lie than the harsh reality.  I get their stance that chaos is generally bad, but I believe that their downplay will prove to be not only ineffective, but will backfire spectacularly. Because of the general trends of communication, right now the population has to cope with a sharp change in discourse in a matter of days, even hours.   My analysis for most countries is that they have 2 communicative phases, as follows:1. Very few testing done --> Extremely low detection sensibility --> Low or no infected detected --> ""We're fine""/""We don't have covid-19 deaths""/ ""No reason to panic""2. Undetected infected builds up --> Sustained clusters develop --> First deaths --> Testing greatly enhanced --> Lot's of ""new"" detections --> Quarantine and drastic measues --> ""This is serious, you can't leave your house"" / ""We need to ban gatherings"" / ""Stop working""Thus, people is exposed to a very reassuring message at first, and then governments must take drastic measures and are forced to tell the truth and put things into perspective. At that point, the drastic shift in communication will only confuse people, create unwanted panic and anger.   I hope that history will put governments in the right place some day, but sadly, right now most countries seem to follow the same pattern.","""People go into denial because they don't feel entitled to be afraid.

fiueqbq,-0.5702,0.0,">Chinese medical staff request international medical assistance in fighting against COVID-19On Jan 24, 2020, we came to Wuhan, China, to support the local nurses in their fight against the COVID-19 infection. We entered the Wuhan isolation ward as the first batch of medical aid workers from Guangdong Province, China. The daily work we are doing is mainly focused on provision of oxygen, electrocardio-gram (ECG) monitoring, tube care, airway management, ventilator de-bugging, central venous intubation, haemodialysis care, and basic nursing care such as disposal and disinfection. The conditions and environment here in Wuhan are more difficult and extreme than we could ever have imagined. There is a severe shortage of protective equipment, such as N95 respirators, face shields, goggles, gowns, and gloves. The goggles are made of plastic that must be repeatedly cleaned and sterilised in the ward, making them difficult to see through. Due to the need for frequent hand washing, several of our colleagues’ hands are covered in painful rashes. As a result of wearing an N95 respirator for extended periods of time and layers of protective equipment, some nurses now have pressure ulcers on their ears and forehead. When wearing a mask to speak with patients, our voices are muted, so we have to speak very loudly. Wearing four layers of gloves is abnormally clumsy and does not work—we can’t even open the packaging bags for medical devices, so giving patients injections is a huge challenge. In order to save energy and the time it takes to put on and take off protective clothing, we avoid eating and drinking for 2 hours before entering the isolation ward. Often, nurses’ mouths are covered in blisters. Some nurses have fainted due to hypoglycaemia and hypoxia. In addition to the physical exhaustion, we are also suffering psychologically. While we are professional nurses, we are also human. Like everyone else, we feel helplessness, anxiety, and fear. Experienced nurses occasionally find the time to comfort colleagues and try to relieve our anxiety. But even experienced nurses may also cry, possibly because we do not know how long we need to stay here and we are the highest-risk group for COVID-19 infection. So far 1716 Chinese staff have been infected with COVID-19 and nine of them have unfortunately passed away. Due to an extreme shortage of health-care professionals in Wuhan, 14 000 nurses from acrossChina have voluntarily come to Wuhan to support local medical health-care professionals. But we need much more help. We are asking nurses and medical staff from countries around the world to come to China now, to help us in this battle. We hope the COVID-19 epidemic will end soon, and that people worldwide will remain in good health. We declare no competing interests.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The x-ray would most likely show something if it was present and the CT would not be necessary. There's a (probably small) group that have findings on CT and x-ray would be negative, and in those cases they would only do a CT if they were sick enough for admission.CTs and CT scanners are expensive, and most sites don't have CT scanners sitting around idle to scan tons of flu patients that are walking through their doors. I suspect China has locally made CT machines that are cheap and they therefore have a lot of them handy to use, the US doesn't have that.CT scans have substantial radiation dose, ~7 mSv. As always, the [helpful xkcd diagram](https://xkcd.com/radiation/) shows this pretty well. Chest CT is the 2nd biggest green block in the upper right.

If the goal is to diagnose as many people as you can reach on in order to minimize the spread of the virus - then its not a solution. You would probably  find nothing in asymptomatic patient's scan, as time is needed to develop the changes in lungs. And if you will find some changes in the lungs - it's difficult to say just from the scan pic what exactly are those changes about. It might be sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, basically - anything. And you can't just misdiagnose so many people.. And you can't put someone with sarcoidosis or tuberculosis in quarantine without actual treatment. I don't see why it might be a reasonable option.

fiuqagv,-0.9776,0.3182,"In addition to what other people mentioned, some general information about the biosafety level classification: Risk assessments (and the resulting biosafety levels) are not exactly inherent to the pathogen, but also dependent on the relative risk to the population during outbreak, not only the individual. Pathogens that might be BSL-2/3 in some countries can be BSL-4 in others (e.g. Junín virus in [Argentina](https://ris.org.in/sites/default/files/article4_v8n1.pdf) vs the [world](https://my.absa.org/Riskgroups)), because only Argentina has 1) a locally licensed vaccine and 2) it is endemic there, therefore the relative risk to the community from a laboratory-acquired infection is lower. The BSL classification is a balance between the potential risks of pathogen break-out and laboratory worker infection (which will take priority), but also the risk of not having enough labs to work on it. For SARS-CoV-2 the current classification means that diagnostics and experiments on inactivated virus can be performed in **BSL-2 facilities**, while virus isolation, propagation and experiments on live virus require **BSL-3 facilities** (as the risk of worker infection is higher while handling more concentrated virus). For further reading here is an overview of risk groups and biosafety levels:https://research.uncc.edu/departments/biosafety/risk-assessment-and-biosafety-levels> Additional pertinent information regarding a pathogen is needed to help answer worst-case scenario questions such as:>-    How can workers be exposed to the biohazard?-    Is there a high probability of infection if exposed?-    Are there any other potentially harmful effects associated with the biohazard (reproductive pathogen, tumorigenic material, potential effects to the cell cycle)-    Are others outside the laboratory (close contacts) at risk in the event of an Laboratory Acquired Infection (LAI)?-    How long will the biohazard survive if it is released outside of primary containment or outside of the laboratory?-    How difficult will it be to inactivate the biohazard upon completion of work or in the event of a spill or release?",CDC Classifies Novel Coronavirus as a BSL-3 Pathogen,2020-02-26 11:04:16,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9y9pr/cdc_classifies_novel_coronavirus_as_a_bsl3/

The 16% number is correct, but leaves out a bunch of details.  As I understood from the base article, the money is still there for health, but is being redistributed focusing more on individual diseases.It's a fairly long and detailed article, but this small quote gives an idea of the moving around of funds.  From the original WP article:>Although the budget reduces overall funding for global health, from $571 million to $532 million in 2021, officials carved out an extra $50 million for global health security, which are measures aimed at disease detection and emergencies. That bump comes at the expense of international HIV/AIDS programs, which is being cut by about $58 million. And even that is a bit incomplete, because later in the article:>The president’s other health priorities include more funding for Trump’s initiative to nearly [wipe out HIV transmission in the United States by 2030](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/trump-administration-pushes-efforts-to-wipe-out-hiv-amid-stalled-progress/2019/12/03/30e606b2-15ed-11ea-8406-df3c54b3253e_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_25&itid=lk_inline_manual_25), which would receive $716 million, shared by several agencies, in his 2021 budget. I'm not defending him or the budget here.  I only wanted to point out that Forbes might have simplified the message a bit too much.  The links are there to follow, for anyone who cares to dig a bit.

And responses to that would be graded based on how reasoned out their response is - whether it's critical of the New Deal or supportive of it.

fiur247,-0.9868,-0.34,"I am not sure I am allowed to post this - but here you go:A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday as several other countries also confirmed new cases and deaths, and President Trump called for a 6 p.m. news conference with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others to discuss the spread of the virus. He accused the media of stoking panic about financial markets.The Dow Jones industrial average endured its worst two-day slump in four years Tuesday. On Wednesday, it was up 300 points shortly after open.On European and Asian financial markets, economic alarms continued to flash, however, with cases spreading and little sign that the epidemic was relenting after the CDC warned of the “inevitable” spread in the United States of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, which has been designated as SARS-CoV-2.France reported the first death of a French citizen from the epidemic as cases grew rapidly across Europe, with Spain confirming eight new cases in the past 24 hours and new infections reported in Germany, Greece, France, Croatia, Austria and Switzerland. A new case in Brazil marks the first known case in Latin America. Although China announced a decline in new confirmed cases on Wednesday, the number of infected people soared in South Korea to more than 1,200, with more expected in the coming days as the state attempts to test 200,000 people.Here are the latest developments:● A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday, bringing the country’s total to 15.● France reported the first coronavirus death of a French citizen amid a dramatic uptick in cases within Europe. Most new cases are connected to an outbreak in northern Italy, still the largest on the continent.● Brazil confirmed its first case, which also marks the first known case in Latin America.● Europe’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index was down 0.6 percent in midday trading Wednesday, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed down 0.7 percent and Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed down nearly 0.8 percent, as the coronavirus’s rapid spread in Italy, Iran and South Korea seemed to reinforce investor fears that the worst is yet to come.● Statistics released by the Chinese government showed a decline in the number of new cases in mainland China; an additional 406 cases were reported Wednesday morning, along with 52 deaths. All but five of the new cases and all of the new deaths were in Hubei province.● South Korea reported 284 additional cases of the coronavirus Wednesday, raising the national tally to 1,261. That number is expected to rise in coming days as the country begins the mass testing of more than 200,000 members of a messianic religious movement at the center of an outbreak in the city of Daegu.","New coronavirus case confirmed in U.S. as outbreak spreads; Trump calls news conference, accuses media of ‘panicking markets’",2020-02-26 11:45:36,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9yxuy/new_coronavirus_case_confirmed_in_us_as_outbreak/

fiw7wfx,-0.5565,0.0,"While mainstream scientists continue to perform mental gymnastics to insist that the new coronavirus wasn't man-made, new research from scientists in China and Europe reveal that the disease happens to have an 'HIV-like mutation' which allows it to bind with human cells up to 1,000 times stronger than the Sars virus.Recall that at the end of January, a team of Indian scientists wrote in a now-retracted, scandalous paper claiming that the coronavirus may have been genetically engineered to incorporate parts of the HIV genome, writing ""This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019- nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,"" meaning - it was unlikely to have occurred naturally.Fast forward to new research by a team from Nankai University, which writes that COV-19 has an 'HIV-like mutation' that  allows it to quickly enter the human body by binding with a receptor called ACE2 on a cell membrane.For those confused, what the latest scientific paper claims is that whereas the Coronavirus may indeed contain a specific HIV-like feature that makes it extremely infectious, that was the result of a rather bizarre ""mutation."" However, since the scientists did not make the scandalous claim that Chinese scientists had created an airborne version of HIV, but instead blamed a mutation, they will likely not be forced to retract it, even if it the odds of such a ""random"" mutation taking place naturally are extremely small.As a reminder, the running narrative is that the new coronavirus lie dormant in bats somewhere between 20 and 70 years, then 'crossed over' to humans through and unknown species - possibly a Pangolin - before it emerged at a Wuhan, China meat market roughly 900 feet from a level-4 bioweapons lab.And what were they researching at said lab? Among other things - why Ebola and HIV can lie dormant in bats without causing diseases.All perfectly ""natural.""","Coronavirus more likely than Sars to bond to human cells, scientists say",2020-02-26 11:55:20,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9z3hn/coronavirus_more_likely_than_sars_to_bond_to/

""We are at the beginning of a corona epidemic in Germany"", said Spahn on Wednesday. ""The chains of infection are partly - and this is a new quality - incomprehensible."" Against this background it is questionable whether the current strategy to contain the virus and end the infection chains will continue to work.In view of the spread of the virus, the Federal Government is forming a crisis management team. Spahn and Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer wanted to provide information on Thursday in Berlin about the establishment of the joint crisis team of their ministries, they said in an invitation on Wednesday. According to a spokesperson, the crisis committee already met for the first time on Wednesday.Spahn spoke out in favor of testing more often if symptoms are present. It should not fail because of money. He said that Germany was still in the phase provided for in the pandemic plan to detect possible infections early and isolate contact persons. However, the phase could also come when this no longer works and not all contacts can be identified.It is not yet clear how the pathogen came to NRWIn Baden-Württemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia, patients had previously been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus for the first time. According to the authorities, the condition of a man from Erkelenz in North Rhine-Westphalia is critical, but has not deteriorated overnight, said Professor Dieter Häussinger, the hospital director in charge. His wife also tested positive for the virus. She is a kindergarten teacher, said North Rhine-Westphalian Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann. Now an attempt is being made to undermine possible chains of infection.The authorities do not yet know where the couple was originally infected. A business partner of the man, who was initially considered a suspected source after an alleged trip to China, was not, District Administrator Stephan Pusch said on Thursday.Recently it had turned out that the patient had still attended a carnival session in his home town of Gangelt. The participants of the session should watch out for symptoms, said Pusch. The pathogen was detected on Wednesday in a soldier stationed in Cologne, who, according to information from the German Press Agency, allegedly took part in the carnival session in question. He is being treated at the Bundeswehr Central Hospital in Koblenz.The man had also been treated at the Cologne university hospital last week. He may have infected people there as well.There, ten employees of the university hospital and 31 patients have now been identified as contact persons. A staff member of the university hospital in Cologne shows symptoms of illness. The result of the coronavirus test is still pending, said Florian Klein, Director of Virology at the University Hospital of Cologne, on Wednesday.After the infection of the kindergarten teacher, all children of the affected institution should also be tested for the virus, said NRW Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU). The children from the facility and their parents had been asked to stay at home. According to the German Press Agency, the infected woman worked in the kindergarten until last Friday.The first confirmed infection with the corona virus has also been found in Mönchengladbach. This is reported by the Rheinische Post and is based on official circles. This brings the number of known infections in NRW to four. Details of the case are not yet known.Four cases in Baden-WürttembergIn Baden-Württemberg, three more people have since become infected with the coronavirus. According to the Ministry of Social Affairs, two of them are the travel companion of a 25-year-old from Göppingen who had fallen ill earlier, and her father. The two are ""in good condition and feel well"", said Nisar Malek, Medical Director of the clinic. The older patient had ""almost no symptoms"", his daughter only had a slight sore throat. All contact persons of the two patients from the past days are known and informed.The 25-year-old from Göppingen returned from a stay in Milan on Friday, 21 February, together with his girlfriend, got a cough on Sunday noon and contacted the Health Office on Tuesday morning, said Stefan Brockmann, head of the Competence Centre for Health Protection at the State Health Office (LGA), on Wednesday in Stuttgart.The third patient is a 32-year-old woman from the district of Rottweil, who also came from the risk area in Italy, according to the Ministry of Health in Stuttgart on Wednesday evening.

This list also includes passengers who were close to his seat on the flight that brought him to Brazil. According to Mandetta, that number could be 50 to 60 people who will be contacted. The goal is that these people can quickly report to the health system if they present symptoms of the disease"" - See more at [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnoticias.uol.com.br%2Fsaude%2Fultimas-noticias%2Fredacao%2F2020%2F02%2F26%2Fempresario-de-61-anos-e-o-primeiro-caso-de-coronavirus-no-brasil.htm](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnoticias.uol.com.br%2Fsaude%2Fultimas-noticias%2Fredacao%2F2020%2F02%2F26%2Fempresario-de-61-anos-e-o-primeiro-caso-de-coronavirus-no-brasil.htm)","Brazil’s first coronavirus COVID-19 case, a 61 year old businessman, was sent to home in a questionable strategy to contain this virus",2020-02-26 14:17:41,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa1f3u/brazils_first_coronavirus_covid19_case_a_61_year/

The Federal government sent a document for all medical personal, this doc is also free to download online, where they set a protocol to when a case is confirmed in Brazil. To sum it up, if you have no serious symptoms the recommended course of action is to go home and stay in self quarantine until you don't have any signtoms.

Then the perfect scenario would be each time someone new gets infected the clock would reset and wait another 14 days, so people would stay there for how long? What ended up happening is people got infected inside the cruise ship and then left for Japan under the impression they were in the clear and then they started infecting the general population. If you already know there's multiple people who are sick on this plane/boat it makes sense to test them and then evaluate if you are going to send them home or keep them in the hospitalThe point is, at this stage of the epidemy there's no point on keeping people locked up at bay since there's a huge chance people will get inside with the virus one way or the other. The overall number of infected world wide is too wide to do this sort of stuff and so far it's proven to be ineffective. CDC who are rigidly enforcing borders already said that this is futile and the virus is going to spread inside the United States one way or the other, people need to be ready for it. If it's inevitable that the virus is going to get in, from what I've read and people who are far more knowledgeable on this than me have said, the best way is to keep the spread of the virus by minimizing the chance of contamination to the general population.

According to Osaka Prefecture, the woman, together with the bus driver from Nara, was on the bus in Japan that carried passengers from Wuhan, China, and was confirmed to be infected with SARS-COV2 in January.    Jan 12-17 Tour bus guide for tourist group from Wuhan, China  Jan 29 Tested positive  Feb 1 Symptoms resolved, discharged (without PCR testing), began self-quarantined at home  Feb 6 Cough, and in a PCR test the same day tested negative  Feb 13 Symptoms disappeared  (from Yahoo)  Feb 19 Persistent throat discomfort and chest pain, went to hospital.  Feb 21 - 25 Returned several times to the hospital she was discharged from  Feb 26 Chest pain did not improve, tested positive    After her initial discharge, she wore a mask and self-quarantined at home. She did not return to work. She had no close contacts.    Expert says: ""Don't know the details yet, but our bodies produce antibodies against a viral infection, so usually we don't get reinfected by the same virus. However, if not enough antibodies were produced, it could result in reinfection, or repopulation by the remaining virus latent in the body.""    Another expert: ""There is a possibility that not enough antibodies were produced, and the virus could not be eliminated from the body. In this case, even though she had no symptoms, it might have turned into a persistent infection. The virus might have repopulated in organs other than the lungs or GI tract, and returned to a level detectable by testing.  This case shows that vigilance is required even after symptoms resolve. If the virus returns to detectable levels, it means that the cases may infect people around them. The national and local governments have to continue careful monitoring of cases even after they are discharged.""    (from Nikkei) As the 3 medical institutions she visited did not have confirmed cases of SARS-COV2, Osaka Prefecture is considering the possibility of reinfection as low.  (from Jiji) Head of Osaka Health and Medical Office(?): ""Virus was not at a detectable level in her throat, but virus latent elsewhere in the body might have reemerged.""",Further details about Osaka tour bus guide in her 40s that retested positive.,2020-02-26 15:24:43,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa2ggo/further_details_about_osaka_tour_bus_guide_in_her/

fiwdgkx,-0.9759,-0.5719,"The fact that you called them publicly built condos instead of just public housing is quite indicative on the gov’s level of competence. The newer public housing buildings does look a lot like condominiums lol, minus the security & amenities like swimming pools. Real condos do exist and are definitely more expensive, but considering how its public housing that gets the benefits like sheltered walkways all the way to the bus/train stations... Public housing in Singapore is nowhere near the same as in other countries where it’s utter shit in comparison so it makes sense why many would turn their noses at the sound of it. I’m from Singapore and can totally agree on a lot of why my country’s so undemocratic. It’s an autocracy pretending to be a democracy. It’s stuck in a dynasty running the country. State media is controlled. Politics is preposterous with gerrymandering and so on. Chewing gum. Caning. Disneyland with a Death Penalty. Etc. But when I go to other countries and see people standing on the roads with signs begging for money, or when there was the time I almost ran over some homeless dude who tried to get money out of my insurance by running in front of my car... I rather that these people at least have a roof over their heads more than anything else, and that needs government intervention for large scale impact. It’s illegal to be homeless, but I think that law functions more as a way to enable police intervention in order to get these people to the services they need to improve their situation. About the racial quotas, their main purpose is in preventing enclaves from being created - which in turns avoid the past problems of riots breaking out between enclaves. Can be a good or bad thing. America boasts a lot about its diversity, but imo its so easy for people to stay in their own groups if they stay outside of the cities. Also I wouldn’t be writing this if I was really severely restricted on free speech. Probably also because I’m also some small fry redditor who isn’t creating waves so it’s not worth the trouble suing the shit out of me. Sorry about the rant. I have a lot of problems with my country, but I do like some parts of it and it’s kind of annoying seeing the good parts get framed in a bad way based on different perceptions of the same thing. But yes it is impossible for the whole world to be like Singapore. So many people will complain at the amount of CCTVs all over the place to begin with lol. And it would a logistical nightmare with anything bigger than a city state for the government. So too bad I guess.","In Singapore: contact tracing registries in every dentist, clinic and bank branch so every potential case can be tracked in detail.

fiweqi1,-0.9415,-0.5719,"Actually been seeing this in a few threads. Singapore’s system is by no means perfect and political freedom can arguably be improved. But I don’t see how dynastic-like rule or dominance by a party (which has brought the country much progress and benefits) can be a problem, much less a factor when it comes to dealing with this crisis. We have consultations and involvements by experts on these matters, and a whole government approach towards crisis management, and people are cooperative in managing the crisis. That’s the focus that other countries, if they are looking at Singapore, should be concerned with. Our system has not been a reason or a motivation for our actions (we still have not locked down whole districts, or forcibly removed people from homes or anything of that sort that might scream violation of human rights) As a singaporean my life is.. per normal. That it can be largely per normal is probably a strong testament to the competency of the government’s actions. Let’s not confused political opinions with how the government has done its job. We may disagree with the system but the results are a separate matter altogether.","In Singapore: contact tracing registries in every dentist, clinic and bank branch so every potential case can be tracked in detail.

fiw2nnz,-0.9869,-0.4767,"I am an ER Physician and I worked some of the protocols for Ebola when it was in Texas. I understand this may seem cruel to people, for hospitals to turn away people but it makes a lot of sense and is in US protocols.  There are several reasons to do this.  First, it means all the patients are in one place so all the experts can go to one place.  There’s no reason for 10 hospitals in an area try to hire specialists or try to test investigational drugs. Keep all the patients in one place and you have less confounding variables. Also, keeping things in one place makes solving problems once instead of over and over. With the Ebola patient the garbage guys refused to pick up trash at that hospital.  Garbage started building up until they found someone willing to take it.  Now multiply that across many hospitals and it becomes a waste of time and energy.  Second, it prevents panic and keeping the community invested in the hospital. When Ebola came out at Presbyterian, people started checking out their family members or bypassing the hospital in an emergency. That creates even more problems. And I completely understand it. No woman wants to delivery a baby at a plague hospital. Some hospitals are the only access points for hundreds of miles around. It is inappropriate to remove a critical access hospital serving thousands because of one patient.  The protocol we used involved keeping the patient in the ambulance, which was already contaminated, and then calling for a CDC evac. They patient would never interact, except over the phone, with ER staff and the ER could stay functional.Lastly, realize we may not be able to do anything for you at the hospital.  With Ebola there was to be no CPR, no intubation, nothing but supportive care. If you code we note the time, turn off the machine; tag, bag, and reload the next patient in to dead guys bed. That’s the reality of crisis medicine. All the while your family is being kept away for their safety.  Sometimes going home is the best choice.","With the new coronavirus continuing to spread in Japan, many patients are being passed around from hospital to hospital as some medical institutions refuse to see patients suspected of having the virus",2020-02-26 18:51:42,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa5bkv/with_the_new_coronavirus_continuing_to_spread_in/

fiw1kb8,0.9382,0.0,"The new coronavirus is spreading in more countries and is likely to be declared a pandemic in the coming days, prompting infectious disease experts to say Canada must take immediate steps to ensure the country is ready to handle it.Governments should issue clear directives to health-care institutions on all aspects of managing a pandemic, they say, from the appropriate use of isolation rooms and masks to the safe transfer of patients between hospitals to the guidance given to family health teams and walk-in clinics.“We are trying to do as much as we can to try and prepare at the hospital level,” said Janine McCready, an infectious diseases physician at Michael Garron Hospital in Toronto. “That window is closing on us.”Dr. McCready said officials need to begin immediately to do what is known as sentinel surveillance to detect COVID-19, the disease the virus causes.This would involve testing a large number of people, such as patients who visit clinics in major cities, those who go to the hospital with unexplained severe respiratory illness, or those who test negative for the flu, Dr. McCready said. Doing that would help determine if and when COVID-19 starts spreading in Canada, and could help prevent the type of situations unfolding in Iran and Italy, where the disease is being widely transmitted and health officials are struggling to figure out how it started.“We definitely want to be ahead of it and we don’t want to be playing catch up,” Dr. McCready said.Currently, most COVID-19 tests are done on people who have a cough, fever or other symptoms who recently travelled to China or other affected countries, including Singapore, Iran, Italy and Japan.Another crucial issue is a potential lack of ventilators, said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. If the virus starts spreading freely in Canada, ventilators will be important in the treatment of patients, particularly those over the age of 65, who appear to experience the worst effects, he said.“There aren’t enough,” said Dr. Fisman, who is also an attending physician at Toronto Western Hospital. “There’s not a lot of clarity and there’s not a lot of leadership and there’s not a strong voice … in terms of how do you prepare in hospitals.”Dr. McCready said she believes hospitals may have enough ventilators, but need guidance on how to make difficult choices about how to assign priority to patients who are critically ill with COVID-19.“We need to be thinking about these decisions now, before I have 10 people in my emergency department who range from 30 to 90 years old who all need a ventilator and we only have five ventilators,” she said.Evidence shows the coronavirus spreads through droplets from such things as sneezes or coughs. Health professionals can protect themselves by wearing surgical masks, gowns, gloves and eye guards. Precautions against airborne transmission include disposable respirator masks, known as N95 masks, and isolation rooms.Dr. McCready said Ontario health-care institutions should stop using airborne precautions against the virus and move to droplet precautions.Without such a change, N95 masks and isolation rooms, which are needed in many areas of health care, could be in very short supply soon, which is why hospitals need to use them wisely, Dr. McCready said.David Williams, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, said the province is looking at increasing its testing capacity and whether it has enough supplies, such as protective equipment, ventilators and beds. Ontario announced its fifth case of the virus on Wednesday, in a traveller from Iran. It’s Canada’s 12th, and the third linked to Iran.Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu said on Wednesday that Canadians should prepare for a possible pandemic by ensuring they have an adequate supply of food and their prescription medications and follow advice about frequent hand washing and staying home when sick.Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases physician at Toronto General Hospital, said it’s important to remember that, based on the existing data, most cases of COVID-19 will be mild.“There’s reacting to this situation and then there’s overreacting to this situation,” he said. “We will have to live our lives, but we also have to be prepared for this as well and appreciate this might have some disruption in our day-to-day life.”For Dr. Bogoch, preparing doesn’t mean stockpiling food. Rather, it means people with chronic conditions should ensure they have enough medication and are getting their health issues managed.Health-care officials must also consider how they would handle an influx of new patients, considering most hospitals are already overcrowded, he said. The good news is that flu season is winding down, and that should free up some capacity, Dr. Bogoch said.","Canada must take immediate steps to prepare itself for potential COVID-19 pandemic, experts say",2020-02-26 19:06:39,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa5iu7/canada_must_take_immediate_steps_to_prepare/

fiw5y7j,0.9771,0.0,"Experts eh?  I think they are more like propagandists Look back to what they said on CBC at the start of February.    They even have seasoned veterans of the Sars outbreak on tv - dodging any obvious logical questions, and instead talking about how risky it is to cross the street.  They insisted that that there was no asymptomatic transmission possible.   They apparently were confident enough to state that.  Now they are stepping back from that - probably over the next 5 tv appearances you’ll forget what they were saying initially.  They insisted that n95 masks were useless - while in the background shot there were pictures and video of Wuhan with everyone wearing masks.     But nope - not in Canada.   These experts on TV were mostly there to inflate their egos and disinform.   They’d say “thanks to our excellent health care system, blah blah blah”.   But the excellence in actual truth amounts to - don’t test anyone and the numbers will stay low.   Similar to USA perhaps.  No respect for docs who follow various “protocols” like a robot  - getting proper care in Canada can be a real battle.   Yes, they want to take pride in being science based - but they have largely lost any ability to practice common sense - it gets to be that the practitioners become gatekeepers more than caregivers.  that’s my opinion.   Sorry nurses and docs in Canada - that’s what I see, and probably not a lot of people want to tell you that in person.

fixc0i0,0.9916,0.0,"Read this before panicking or making inappropriate comparisons.   You must distinguish between biological latency and clinical latency. Only a handful of viruses, mostly herpesvirus, can establish biological latency, meaning that they disappear completely. All of us are EBV+ but almost none of us would test positive to an EBV PCR on our blood. To do so, they need mind-boggling complex genetics, that even if you are a layperson can judge by simply looking at the size of their genome: EBV is 170 kbp, HSV1 is 150 kbp. It's a lot. They need a lot of proteins and other genetic material to hijack host cells, hide from the immune system and so on.  Then there's clinical latency. It basically means that you don't show symptoms, but the virus is actively propagating throughout your body. This is the case of HIV and HCV, to name two of them. But the virus can always be demonstrated: there will always be a viral load. Just for comparison, HCV is 9 kbp. HIV is about the same. They need far less genetic products to do their gig and rely on other mechanisms to escape the immune system.  Now. The SARS-COV-2 is 80% similar to the 2003 SARS, which did not exhibit any latency whatsoever. There is no reason to suspect that this new virus, which is neither hyper-mutable nor has a very complex genome, is able to do so. All evidence points to the fact that when a sufficient immune response is built, the virus is cleared. Yes, there is the report that 14% still exhibit viral shedding from anal swabs, but it's 14% and they simply need more time. If there was a reservoir in the intestines, you'd have 100% of them turn positive. As a comparison, you can shed Norovirus (the etiological agent of the ""stomach flu"") for \_months\_ after you've gotten better! It's a very common phenomenon and nothing to be worried about.  There is no reason whatsoever to think that this might be ""an airborne HIV"" or whatever. People would consistently test positive - just like untreated HIV -, not become negative, because there would be continued viral replication in their system. So, it's simply impossible. What has happend to this unlucky lady, then? In all likelihood, she never recovered completely and suffered a relapse.   We do not know how long the immunity lasts, but from all we know about all the human diseases, at least SOME time, at least a few months, with partial protection after that. So I rule out re-infection as well.   Also, while I am at it. The Antibody-Dependant Enhancement (ADE) is a very poorly understood mechanism that has been brought in to explain the behavior of one single viral haemorragic tropical fever, the Dengue fever. However, it must be clearly stated that a minimal amount of resources have been poured into Dengue, which is what they call ""a neglected disease,"" and it's widely assumed that there is much more to it than that. ADE is believed to occur for many diseases, like HIV or Ebola.  However, the immune system adopts a multi-pronged approach and has other weapons at its disposal. In fact, you can heal from Dengue and Ebola, even if untreated. Viruses are astute, but our immune system is even more so.  Even our scientists are quite astute. While both Dengue and Ebola use ADE, we also have vaccines for both of them. Despite what initially seemed like enormous biological hurdles, we now have an Ebola vaccine that works perfectly fine (ZEBOV). There is also a working Dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, albeit it's imperfect as it's recommended - had more money been poured into it, and trust me very little of it has been invested as it's a tropical disease, I'm sure we'd have a better one. Due to biological characteristics unique to them, we do not have a HCV or HIV vaccine BUT 1) we have extremely effective medications that keep them contained indefinitely 2) these biological characteristics are not shared by SARS-COV-2.Also. People are bringing up the previous SARS/MERS vaccine trials and saying that they failed because of ADE reactions, so we're all doomed. No, they didn't. They ""failed"" because of a completely different phenomenon called TH2 hypersensitization. It has NOTHING to do with ADE. In fact, when scientists tried [another way](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4135953/), they managed to obtain protection without the drawback of lung damage. I must add, back in the day SARS was a forgotten disease and there was exceedingly little research done about potential vaccines, with extremely few resources.   Now that there will hopefully be billions of dollars thrown at COVID, scientists will have all the money they need. Again, from a purely biological perspective, an Ebola vaccine was a much higher mountain to climb, but they worked their magic and did it just fine. And, since you like it so much, they had to defeat ADE in the process.  All we need is 1) TIME (we won't start jabbing people tomorrow, sorry. Anyone who tells you less than 3 years for a widespread vaccination effort is lying) 2) MONEY.","Japanese woman confirmed as coronavirus case for second time, weeks after initial recovery",2020-02-26 19:56:21,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa66f4/japanese_woman_confirmed_as_coronavirus_case_for/

fiwi2ta,0.759,0.0,"**This from the Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)****If clinical severity is low** The majority of cases are likely to experience mild to moderate clinical features. People in at-risk groups and those with comorbidities may experience more severe illness. Strategies to support at-risk groups, once they are identified, may be required (e.g. people with underlying illness, people with immunocompromised conditions, aged care, infants, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, remote communities). At the peak of the outbreak, and increasingly when transmissibility is higher, primary care and hospital services may become stretched in areas associated with respiratory illness and acute care. Existing legislation is likely to be sufficient to support activities. The level of impact on the community may be similar to severe seasonal influenza or the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.  **If clinical severity is moderate** People in at-risk groups may experience severe illness. As the number of cases grows the number of people presenting for medical care is likely to be higher than for severe seasonal influenza and primary care and hospital services will be under severe pressure, particularly in areas associated with respiratory illness and acute care. Non-urgent procedures and activities may need to be scaled back. Surge staffing and alternate models of clinical care, such as cohorting and/or establishment of flu-like clinics may need to be employed to cope with increased demands for healthcare. Pressure on health services will be more intense, rise more quickly and peak earlier as the transmissibility of the disease increases. Healthcare staff may themselves be ill or have to care for ill family members, further exacerbating pressures on healthcare providers. Additional strategies to support at-risk groups may be required (e.g. people with underlying illness, people with immunocompromised conditions, aged care, infants, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, remote communities). New and/or existing health emergency legislation may be needed to support outbreak response specific activities.   **If clinical severity is high** Widespread severe illness will cause concern and challenge the capacity of the health sector. Areas such as primary care, acute care, pharmacies, nurse practitioners and aged care facilities will be stretched to capacity to support essential care requirements. Heavy prioritisation will be essential within hospitals to maintain essential services and mortuary services will be under pressure. The demand for specialist equipment and personnel is likely to challenge capacity. Pressure on health services will be more intense, rise more quickly and peak earlier as the transmissibility of the disease increases. Healthcare staff may themselves be ill or have to care for ill family members, further exacerbating pressures on healthcare providers. Secondary care services, such as blood services and diagnostic services will be challenged to maintain capacities and the community focus will be on maintaining essential services. Health emergency legislation may be needed to support outbreak specific activities. The level of impact may be similar to that of the 1918 H1N1 ‘Spanish flu’. These scenarios characterise the impact on the Australian community as a whole.","Australian Government moves forward with CV action, virus has entered pandemic Phase.",2020-02-26 21:44:24,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa7fxe/australian_government_moves_forward_with_cv/

fiwh3ms,-0.9787,0.0,">and from a scientific point of view: corona viruses are ""new territory"" for the immune system. can it be that the immune memory simply needs longer time and several contacts to develop a kind of ""immunization""? vaccinations work according to this principle?One absolutely different thing to consider is possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry for coronaviruses, there was some quite recent and serious academical science study on such phenomenon:> ADE has been observed for coronaviruses. Several studies have shown that sera induced by SARS-CoV spike enhance viral entry into Fc-receptor-expressing cells. Further, one study demonstrated that unlike receptor-dependent viral entry, sera dependent SARS-CoV entry does not go through the endosome pathway.> Additionally, it has long been known that **immunization of cats with feline coronavirus spike leads to worsened future infection due to the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies**. However, detailed molecular mechanisms for ADE of coronavirus entry are still unknown.https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/5/e02015-19.longWhat it might mean in practice:> > It’s highly possible to get infected a second time,” one of the doctors, who declined to be identified, told the outlet.> > The physician said that medication used to treat the virus can have negative side effects on patients’ heart tissue, making them more susceptible to cardiac arrest.> > “A few people recovered from the first time by their own immune system, but the meds [sic] they use are damaging their heart tissue, and **when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn’t help but makes it worse**, and they die a sudden death from heart failure,” the doctor said.https://nypost.com/2020/02/19/whistleblower-doctors-say-coronavirus-reinfection-even-deadlier/amp/?__twitter_impression=true&utm_source=reddit.comSo initially most cases may be so mild that most people in US will just brush it off as bad, but simple flu and then get reinfected with way worse consequences. It will take some time inevitably to really confirm such turn of events, but in China reinfection already has become semi-official thing:> A previously recovered novel coronavirus patient in Chengdu, Sichuan province was re-hospitalized after testing positive for the virus on Wednesday, the city’s health administration told the Beijing Youth Daily on Friday. The patient had previously recovered from the disease 10 days earlier.https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/21/WS5e4fc442a31012821727963c.html",Japanese woman reinfected with coronavirus weeks after initial recovery,2020-02-26 21:44:41,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa7g1i/japanese_woman_reinfected_with_coronavirus_weeks/

fiwezbk,-0.9914,0.2748,"The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.  1. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)] .  2. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)] . This makes it much more difficult to control.  3. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)]. 4. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)] . 5. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.  6. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21). Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. This virus is potentially devastating if containment measures fail.

fix88yr,-0.9844,0.0,"Today, February 27, 2020My university classes are shut down for the day, so I did some digging. This is the results of my research today, written to be easily consumed.This novel coronavirus is very infectious and spreads very rapidly. It remains undetected at first, with mild symptoms. However, Sars-Cov2 (its proper name) is antibody enhancement dependant.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31826992What this means, is that non-neutralizing antiviral proteins facilitate virus entry into host cells, leading to increased infectivity in the cells. Some cells do not have the usual receptors on their surfaces that viruses use to gain entry. The antiviral proteins (i.e., the antibodies) bind to antibody Fc receptors that some of these cells have in the plasma membrane. The viruses bind to the antigen binding site at the other end of the antibody. ADE is common in cells cultured in the laboratory, but rarely occurs in vivo except for dengue virus. This virus can use this mechanism to infect human macrophages, causing a normally mild viral infection to become life-threatening. This also allows for reinfection later, with a much more deadly second wave, once someone comes in contact with a second serotype. As noted prior, this only occurs with one other virus, dengue. Additionally, we know that this means that vaccines will only worsen the situation, due to research into a vaccine for Sars-Cov1Prior immunization with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid protein causes severe pneumonia in mice infected with SARS-CoV. J Immunol. 181:6337-48https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18941225https://www.jimmunol.org/content/181/9/6337.longTe et al., 2012. Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology on challenge with the SARS virus. PLoS One 7(4)https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382Tseng et al., 2012. Double-Inactivated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Vaccine Provides Incomplete Protection in Mice and Induces Increased Eosinophilic Proinflammatory Pulmonary Response Upon Challengehttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3209347/Additionally, the governments of the world are purposely miscalculating the correct Case Fatality Rate (CFR). According to Battegay Manue et al., the current CFR being published in the media is incorrect.https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20203Similarly, during the first SARS outbreak in the early 2000's, the media published a CFR of 3%, until after the outbreak finished and it was revealed that the true CFR was 9.6%. According to Ghani et al, one of the proper methods to compute CFR during an outbreak is to divide deaths during a period by the number of deaths plus recoveries of a period.CFR estimate = Deaths/Deaths+Recoveredhttps://academic.oup.com/aje/article/162/5/479/82647Using this method, we get 2,814 (deaths) / 33,272 (recovered) + 2,814 (deaths) = 7.80% (official numbers for today, February 27, 2020, it is likely that the death number is understated due to the motivations of Chinese officials to downplay the number of deaths, but this CFR is far more accurate then the 3% number)For comparison, the flu normally has a CFR of 0.1% or one in a thousand.In conclusion, this Sars-Cov2 or COVD-19 is far more dangerous and deadly, when compared to the flu, or in fact, almost any virus in the world today. When you realize that it is far more infectious compared to, for example, a mosquito born virus like dengue, far deadlier than the flu, and is antibody enhancement dependant, similar to dengue, but unique in its widespread transmission, the severity of the situation becomes clear.*All of the sources cited here are scientific, and most are peer reviewed, some were published under review, due to the urgent nature of their findings and the ongoing situation.",Even if the Coronavirus is contained and this all blows over...,2020-02-26 23:45:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa8o4x/even_if_the_coronavirus_is_contained_and_this_all/

The US government wiped out the entire supply chain january first. 90 million masks from 3M alone.You can still get hooded/booted tyvek, but thats because there isn't one universal size. Theres small to 6x (biggg bois).You can still get half respirators and organic vaper cartridges, till about 2 this afternoon from granger and other safety suppliers. After 2 everything is alocated to state and local government.This is from 3M products and is affordable. Mask are about 15 bucks each and the filters are 7 for a pair. Half mask respirators you will want you will have to size to your face, please dont need remove them from the package and try them on, and then out it back if it doesnt fit. That's gross and spreads contamination. But they are 6100 for small, 6200 for medium, 6300 for large. Full face masks are.out of stock, and thanks tonthe trade war, 225 dollars a pop, and another 35 usually because they have to be fitted to your face, if your male you have to be clean shaven or you will fail the test and be denied sale of a mask. Filters. They are pink and round. They are called the 2091 organic filter. They have a micron filter capable of handling organic matter, some virus's. Not all because those shits are tiny but most, ands its been proven that masks are not completely effective, but it does help. The filter will last a month with constant use. If your sparing and sane you can make it last six months. After they expire, and you can tell when they do, you will be able to smell normal things through them, lay the filters out in the sun and soray them with lysol. And then burn them.Now that said.You people need to understand how things work. This stuff takes time to make. It always has. It doesnt grow on tree's. Hard to fill orders when the item doesnt exist. Oh yea, btw are you aware we closed our borders to china? We cant get anything from there right now because they have no docks open. No cargo planes arriving. A lot of safety apparel and PPE come from china. Kinda hard to comply with your demands when, you know, they complied with your demands and sealed all traffic from china till april.You demand something from the government but what are you doing? Oh your prepping. Ok cool. Thats fucking selfish you are only prepping for yourself. How dare you not prep for everyone in your neighborhood. You should have just done it, because thats what good people do right? They demand it of you. wait whats that? You cant get something because it hasnt been made yet? Dont have the money? Dont care! You should have known better.This all started two months ago. You think that we have the power to toss up fully functioning hospitals complete with fully trained medical staff on a what if? We don't. You want care? Holy crap do you really want a dude who trained for a month to try and put you on a ventilator should you need it? Where are you gonna find the people willing to learn that? You? You know basic first aid. Obviously you should be a surgeon by now, google is right there.See its pretty unreasonable isnt it. Thats what people are asking of the government.Finally. Loads of fear here. If some prof uses this site as a case study, it will be used to see why the general puplic should never be told anything. The amount of conspiracy and controversy here is staggering. I am ashamed of my countries people for the amount of fearmongering and rumor milling done.Yes this virus is gonna be bad. Its super infectious. However you all are.taking the fatality rate and ballooning it into 1000 times deadlier. Thats messed up. Thats nonsense. You do realize of it was that bad, the governments of the world would have been shooting planes out of the sky and drowning ships to keep it out? Are you aware of that? Extreme I know. But if it had the get it and your dead kill rate you people say it does, the governments wouldnt be just buying ppe. They would be blowing shit up. Chinese everywhere would be gathered up and tossed into camps. Any who were found to be from wuhan would have been executed. Sounds familiar? Its what we did to the japanese in ww2.Its okay to be afraid. Its not okay to blow things so out of proportion, that someone ignorant seeing it, will believe it. And hurt themselves and others in their ignorance.Prepare? Yes. Panic? No. Be reasonable. Be safe. And most of all remember this one last fact.
