There are main carnival events, with organised teams with unique costume concepts, which take place in big parades around the central streets of the cities. At the same time, people go to clubs and bars around the city, that are open all day long at the carnival period. The carnival is very popular for young people, kids and especially college and university students. I lived in the city of Patras as a student for 5 years and i have participated in the main carnival event many times. I am sure that this was a hard decision for the Greek government because this canchelation will affect many businesses that rely on the carnival period (bars, clubs, restaurants, private busses, hotels, airbnb appartments, travel agencies).

fiwvdm4,0.4596,0.1877,"Finally a post about Lithuania. I wanted to post my opinion but i created an account just yesterday so i can't post a thread. Anyway here is situation in Lithuania in my opinion:  I follow corona virus outbreak since it started in China and Lithuanian government does not take any preventive or preparation measures. From January 23 till February 11 220 Chinese nationals came to Lithuania also last weekend we had 15 planes from Italy after the outbreak in the north and still no confirmed cases. Right now government only gives recommendations: if you have been in China or North Italy and have symptoms you should call 911 if you have symptoms but you have not been in north Italy or China you should go to med clinic. Also no travel warning from/to Iran although Estonia, Kuwait, Iraq and more countries reported their first cases from people who came from Iran. Moreover in the capital of Lithuania with 500 k. + population we have only 100 beds and 4 ICU prepared in the main hospital and you can't be tested from corona virus even for money unless you have symptoms. Taking into conclusion how infectious this virus is and that most infective cases are asymptomatic it is unbelievable that we don't have a single case to this day. Latest news are also quite disturbing. We have upcoming Euroleague match Žalgiris vs Milan in Kaunas, health ministry recomended to postpone the game but Žalgiris decided to play with fans present.

fix04n1,-0.8535,0.0,"Confirmed deaths / confirmed cases is NOT an accurate measure of CFR while an outbreak is occuring!  You cannot mix resolved and unresolved cases.  In other words, if:confirmed cases - recoveries - deaths != 0, then you cant use this to determine CFR.  Or more specifically, the larger that result is, the more inaccurate it will be.When you compute this, your denominator includes cases that have not resolved, and thus could go either way.  For example, imagine 100 cases, 5 deaths, and 32 recoveries.  Tempting to say the CFR is 5%, but 63 cases have not resolved!A more accurate estimate is: deaths / (deaths + recoveries), or 5/(5+32) in that example, = 5/37, or 13.5%.Even still, that method can be fairly inaccurate, due to inaccurate reporting, insufficient knowledge, small sample size, etc, so if you use this method on some of the numbers right now, you might see much higher CFR, but sample sizes could still be far too low, or we just dont know enough yet.See: [Methods for Estimating the Case Fatality Ratio for a Novel, Emerging Infectious Disease](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/162/5/479/82647)",Italy confirms 75 new cases of coronavirus and 2 new deaths; total of 528 cases and 14 deaths,2020-02-27 04:05:08,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fab3xz/italy_confirms_75_new_cases_of_coronavirus_and_2/

fiwzjdf,0.7543,-0.3071," Government guidelines are telling quarantined Chinese students to “walk quickly” past members of the public under loose rules that could potentially spread the deadly coronavirus.Hundreds of Chinese Year 11 and 12 school students hosted by Aussie families are expected to arrive in Australia shortly to continue their studies but they will have to be in home isolation for 14 days after arriving from China.The students will be living in the same household as Australian families who are allowed out into the community to go to work and to school every day – even though they are cohabiting with someone who potentially has the coronavirus.The slack quarantine rules recommend the Chinese student stays in their own room and to “walk quickly “if they have to cross commonly used spaces in the hosts home.If possible they should use their own bathroom but this is not compulsory.“If the student lives in an apartment it is also safe for them to go outside into the garden while wearing a surgical mask. They should, however, go quickly through any common areas on the way to the garden. They should wear a surgical mask if they have to move through these areas,” the guidelines said. State and federal governments last week agreed to lift the travel ban to allow Chinese students enrolled in Year 11 and 12 courses in Australia into the country because of strict rules that require them to physically attend school to gain their qualification.Students from Hubei province in China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, will not be allowed into Australia under the relaxation of the rule.Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan estimated around 760 Chinese students could be allowed into Australia if they met strict criteria including being tested for the virus before they left China and again when they arrived here.They must then undergo home isolation for 14 days before being allowed to attend school.Victoria’s Education Minister James Merlino has said there are 389 Chinese students enrolled in the state’s VCE that could come to Australia as a result of the rule change.In New South Wales the number is around 153 and other state and territories have a smaller number.Victorian Government quarantine rules state the families that host these students do not have to quarantine themselves from the community nor do they even have to wear a mask while in the community.“Other members of the household are not required to be isolated unless they have also travelled to mainland China in the past 14 days, or have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. Other members of the household do not need to wear a mask at any time,” the guidelines issued by Victoria’s Department of Health state.Federal Department of Health guidelines for students say students in isolation only need to wear a mask when they develop symptoms of the virus and when this happens should try to use a separate bathroom.“Do not see visitors. Where possible, ask others such as friends or family, who are not required to be isolated, to get food or other necessities,” the federal guidelines state.Griffith University Infectious diseases exert Paul Van Buynder said the guidelines were working on the principle that the virus was only transmitted once a person began displaying symptoms.“It’s totally dependent on how well we are monitoring them,” he said.“If they can’t transmit until they have symptoms it is safe.”","Questions over home isolation rules for Chinese students returning to Australia.

If the virus causes mild infection that mimics a bad cold/flu (during peak flu season at that), most people will initially only think it's just that and buy some tylenol and dayquil while going about their days until symptoms worsen or abate. If they worsen, it may take them a week or more to get concerned about it and in that time they'd be spreading it in their communities. If symptoms get bad enough to warrant a doctors visit/ trip to the ER, the first instinct of many doctors would be to rule out influenza and only then would they become weary of a possible nCov infection. After that, they'd have to wait until their samples are tested and confirmed by the CDC which admittedly is underequipped to handle more than a few hundred tests a day.2. Most people with mild infections won't seek treatment due to cost, and will only seek help when things get severe. At the same time, many low wage service employees can't afford to take days off and will take some tylenol and work through their illness just to so they can pay the rent.

The  patient was transferred to the medical center from another hospital in  Northern California with a suspected viral infection, and was already on  a ventilator upon arrival, according to the letter.“Upon  admission, our team asked public health officials if this case could be  Covid-19,” the letter said. The medical center requested testing from  the C.D.C. “Since the patient did not fit the existing C.D.C. criteria  for Covid-19, a test was not immediately administered. U.C. Davis Health  does not control the testing process.”",Coronavirus Patient in California Was Not Tested for Days,2020-02-27 04:52:40,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fabnn6/coronavirus_patient_in_california_was_not_tested/

fix9jml,0.8875,0.0,"*While previously dismissed, there may actually be some validity to the links to COVID19 and HIV/Eboloa viruses according to new research and papers to be published. From the article:*The new coronavirus has an HIV-like mutation that means its ability to bind with human cells could be up to 1,000 times as strong as the Sars virus, according to new research by scientists in China and Europe.The discovery could help to explain not only how the infection has spread but also where it came from and how best to fight it.Scientists showed that Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) entered the human body by binding with a receptor protein called ACE2 on a cell membrane. And some early studies suggested that the new coronavirus, which shares about 80 per cent of the genetic structure of Sars, might follow a similar path.But the ACE2 protein does not exist in large quantities in healthy people, and this partly helped to limit the scale of the Sars outbreak of 2002-03, in which infected about 8,000 people around the world.Other highly contagious viruses, including HIV and Ebola, target an enzyme called furin, which works as a protein activator in the human body. Many proteins are inactive or dormant when they are produced and have to be “cut” at specific points to activate their various functions.------------In a follow-up study, a research team led by Professor Li Hua from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, Hubei province, confirmed Ruan’s findings.The mutation could not be found in Sars, Mers or Bat-CoVRaTG13, a bat coronavirus that was considered the original source of the new coronavirus with 96 per cent similarity in genes, it said.This could be “the reason why SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than other coronaviruses”, Li wrote in a paper released on Chinarxiv on Sunday.Meanwhile, a study by French scientist Etienne Decroly at Aix-Marseille University, which was published in the scientific journal Antiviral Research on February 10, also found a “furin-like cleavage site” that is absent in similar coronaviruses.======**Edit**: Raising a point [someone else raised](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fadbwi/coronavirus_far_more_likely_than_sars_to_bond_to/fixa7eh/) in this thread, a number of viruses that have jumped to humans take advantage of ""furin-like cleavage"" meaning it's not necessarily unique/notable that it has this behavior, or as clear evidence of being related to another virus.[Twitter Discussion on furin-like cleavage](https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen/status/1233024055730675714)","Coronavirus far more likely than Sars to bond to human cells due to HIV-like mutation, scientists say",2020-02-27 07:02:23,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fadbwi/coronavirus_far_more_likely_than_sars_to_bond_to/

fixjwf9,-0.9853,0.0,"This is research I have done, specific comments on why reinfection is possible included below.This novel coronavirus is very infectious and spreads very rapidly. It remains undetected at first, with mild symptoms. However, Sars-Cov2 (its proper name) is antibody enhancement dependant.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31826992What this means, is that non-neutralizing antiviral proteins facilitate virus entry into host cells, leading to increased infectivity in the cells. Some cells do not have the usual receptors on their surfaces that viruses use to gain entry. The antiviral proteins (i.e., the antibodies) bind to antibody Fc receptors that some of these cells have in the plasma membrane. The viruses bind to the antigen binding site at the other end of the antibody. ADE is common in cells cultured in the laboratory, but rarely occurs in vivo except for dengue virus. This virus can use this mechanism to infect human macrophages, causing a normally mild viral infection to become life-threatening. This also allows for reinfection later, with a much more deadly second wave, once someone comes in contact with a second serotype. As noted prior, this only occurs with one other virus, dengue. Additionally, we know that this means that vaccines will only worsen the situation, due to research into a vaccine for Sars-Cov1Prior immunization with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid protein causes severe pneumonia in mice infected with SARS-CoV. J Immunol. 181:6337-48https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18941225https://www.jimmunol.org/content/181/9/6337.longTe et al., 2012. Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology on challenge with the SARS virus. PLoS One 7(4)https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382Tseng et al., 2012. Double-Inactivated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Vaccine Provides Incomplete Protection in Mice and Induces Increased Eosinophilic Proinflammatory Pulmonary Response Upon Challengehttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3209347/Additionally, the governments of the world are purposely miscalculating the correct Case Fatality Rate (CFR). According to Battegay Manue et al., the current CFR being published in the media is incorrect.https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20203Similarly, during the first SARS outbreak in the early 2000's, the media published a CFR of 3%, until after the outbreak finished and it was revealed that the true CFR was 9.6%. According to Ghani et al, one of the proper methods to compute CFR during an outbreak is to divide deaths during a period by the number of deaths plus recoveries of a period.CFR estimate = Deaths/Deaths+Recoveredhttps://academic.oup.com/aje/article/162/5/479/82647Using this method, we get 2,814 (deaths) / 33,272 (recovered) + 2,814 (deaths) = 7.80% (official numbers for today, February 27, 2020, it is likely that the death number is understated due to the motivations of Chinese officials to downplay the number of deaths, but this CFR is far more accurate then the 3% number)For comparison, the flu normally has a CFR of 0.1% or one in a thousand.In conclusion, this Sars-Cov2 or COVD-19 is far more dangerous and deadly, when compared to the flu, or in fact, almost any virus in the world today. When you realize that it is far more infectious compared to, for example, a mosquito born virus like dengue, far deadlier than the flu, and is antibody enhancement dependant, similar to dengue, but unique in its widespread transmission, the severity of the situation becomes clear.*All of the sources cited here are scientific, and most are peer reviewed, some were published under review, due to the urgent nature of their findings and the ongoing situation.",Japan confirms reinfection.,2020-02-27 08:11:31,/r/Coronavirus/comments/faecv9/japan_confirms_reinfection/

Nearly 3,000 deaths. More than 81,000 cases. Six continents infected.But government officials and medical experts, in their warnings about the epidemic, have also sounded a note of reassurance: Though the virus can be deadly, the vast majority of those infected so far have only mild symptoms and make full recoveries.It is an important factor to understand, medical experts said, both to avoid an unnecessary global panic and to get a clear picture of the likelihood of transmission.“Many people are now panicking, and some actually are exaggerating the risks,” said Dr. Jin Dongyan, a virology expert at the University of Hong Kong. “For governments, for public health professionals — they also have to deal with these, because these will also be harmful.”Much about the virus remains unknown, and the danger could intensify as it travels through the rest of the world. But based on existing information, here’s what experts say about the severity of the virus.More than 80 percent of cases are mild, one large study in China found.ImageMedical staff transferring a coronavirus patient in Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak, last week.Medical staff transferring a coronavirus patient in Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak, last week.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesOf the 44,672 coronavirus cases that were confirmed in China by Feb. 11, more than 36,000 — or 81 percent — were mild, according to a study published recently by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Cases were considered mild if they did not involve pneumonia, defined as infection of the lungs, or involved only mild pneumonia, the authors wrote in the study, which is among the largest to date of the new coronavirus.There were two other categories of cases, severe and critical. Severe cases featured shortness of breath, low blood oxygen saturation or other lung problems. Critical cases featured respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction.Just under 14 percent of patients were severe, and just under 5 percent critical.The overall fatality rate in China was 2.3 percent. But that number was inflated by the much higher fatality rate in Hubei Province, of 2.9 percent, compared with a rate of just 0.4 percent in the rest of the country. The seasonal flu, by comparison, has a mortality rate of about 0.1 percent.The true fatality rate could be even lower, given that many mild or asymptomatic cases may not have been reported to the authorities.A mild case may look like the common cold.Mild cases are inherently difficult for scientists to describe, because those with limited symptoms may not seek medical care. Scientists have also said that people can be infected but not show any symptoms at all.For many with mild infections, the coronavirus could be virtually indistinguishable from the common cold or seasonal flu, said Dr. Jin of the University of Hong Kong.Interactive PromoCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the OutbreakThe virus has infected more than 82,400 people in China and at least 46 other countries.“Some of these patients, they just go unrecognized,” he said. “It could be just as small as a sore throat. Then one day, two days, it’s gone.”Even among patients who do go see a doctor, “it could still be very mild, just like a flu,” he added.As the Chinese Center for Disease Control’s study showed, some mild cases may involve pneumonia. They may also include mild fatigue and low fever, according to a treatment plan released by the central Chinese government.A small study of 99 confirmed coronavirus patients in Wuhan, published in the medical journal, The Lancet, found that most of the patients had fever or cough when they were admitted to the hospital, and some had shortness of breath or muscle ache. The study did not distinguish between mild, severe and critical cases.Most people with mild infections recover.ImagePatients recovering from the coronavirus last week at a temporary hospital in a gymnasium in Wuhan. Patients recovering from the coronavirus last week at a temporary hospital in a gymnasium in Wuhan. Credit...Chinatopix, via Associated PressThere is no doubt that the virus can be dangerous, especially for critical cases. Of those patients, 49 percent died, according the study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control.But critical cases made up just a tiny fraction of the total caseload in the study.By Thursday, of the 78,487 confirmed cases in China, 32,495, or 41 percent, had been discharged from the hospital, according to China’s National Health Commission. About 8,300 of the remaining patients were in serious condition. More than 2,700 people have died in China.Many of the deaths have occurred in Hubei Province, where the outbreak began, and where the demand for care has overwhelmed medical staff. The high mortality rate there could have dangerous implications for developing countries. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, has warned repeatedly of the toll the virus could exact in places with weak health systems.But for mild cases, the virus is likely “self-limiting,” Dr. Jin said, meaning that symptoms will go away on their own, as with the flu and common cold.But the plethora of mild cases can make containment more difficult.ImageA public security volunteer checking temperatures at the entrance to a village in the Beijing district of Tongzhou on Friday.A public security volunteer checking temperatures at the entrance to a village in the Beijing district of Tongzhou on Friday.Credit...Wu Hong/EPA, via ShutterstockThe number of mild cases, though, creates its own complications for curbing the virus’s spread.Those with mild or no symptoms may not know they have contracted the virus, or may pass it off as a seasonal cold. They may then continue in their daily lives — traveling, kissing, coming into close contact with others — and spread the virus without anyone knowing.“In this manner, a virus that poses a low health threat on the individual level can pose a high risk on the population level, with the potential to cause disruptions of global public health systems and economic losses,” a group of five scientists wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine last week.There are, broadly speaking, two possible outcomes of the current outbreak, Dr. Jin said. The new virus could, like SARS, another well-known coronavirus, become less and less transmissible as it spreads around the world, eventually dying out.Alternatively, the new coronavirus could become well established in humans, becoming a kind of recurring, seasonal nuisance, like the flu, Dr. Jin said. In that situation, people would learn to live with it, and sometimes would contract illnesses from it; but the virus would most likely also lose some of its dangerousness as time went on. Experts could also develop a vaccine, Dr. Jin added.Even mild cases could provide immunity from future infection.ImageThe Hong Kong subway on Tuesday. “Anyone recovered from the infection should have useful antibodies,” one expert in Hong Kong said.The Hong Kong subway on Tuesday. “Anyone recovered from the infection should have useful antibodies,” one expert in Hong Kong said.Credit...Isaac Lawrence/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesSeveral medical experts have said that those who have been infected with the coronavirus will not become infected again, as their bodies will produce antibodies that provide immunity.“As long as the virus doesn’t evolve, there is no chance of being infected again,” Dr. Lu Hongzhou, a public health professor in Shanghai, said on Tuesday in an interview with Beijing News.And that immunity should extend even to those who had mild or even asymptomatic infections. “Anyone recovered from the infection should have useful antibodies,” Dr. Jin said.The body’s natural immune response is the reason the Chinese authorities have asked recovered patients to donate blood plasma, in the hopes that their antibodies could be used to treat sick patients. The government has also prescribed antiviral drugs and traditional Chinese medicine as treatment methods.","NYT: The coronavirus can be deadly, but 80% of cases so far seem to be mild.

fiy0521,-0.9831,0.0,"Full article translation (cursory proofread of Google Translate):Several new cases of corona have been confirmed in Sweden, the Public Health Agency reports on Thursday evening. There are five new cases around Sweden. Three have been infected after travel abroad, two have been infected in Sweden.Another five people in Sweden have been detected infected by the coronavirus. This applies to three people in Västra Götaland, one person in the Uppsala Region and one person in the Stockholm region, the Public Health Agency writes in a press release on Thursday evening.Two of the people in Västra Götaland have had close contact with the person who was previously found infected during Wednesday. The third person in Västra Götaland has been infected during a trip in northern Italy.A person in Uppsala has been infected during a trip in Germany. That person is now receiving care.One person in the Stockholm region was infected during a trip in Iran and is now treated in isolation at the Karolinska University Hospital's infectious clinic.Now we work according to our routines. The patient receives care and we carry out infection tracking to reach any persons the patient may have had contact with. It is important to emphasize that what we have now confirmed is a case of a person who has been infected outside Sweden and not here in Stockholm, says Per Follin, Infectious Disease Surveyor at Infectious Diseases Stockholm in a press release.In total, there are now seven cases of corona in Sweden.The public health authority now estimates that the risk of more people being discovered in Sweden infected by the new corona virus abroad is high.It was expected that we would receive new cases of infection in Sweden. So far, all cases of covid-19 are connected to travelers, directly or indirectly through close contact with an infected person and we currently do not see any general spread of infection out in the community, says Britta Björkholm, Head of Department at the Public Health Authority in a press release.The Public Health Authority will hold a press conference at 20:00.",Sweden just got five new cases,2020-02-27 10:51:02,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fagtb5/sweden_just_got_five_new_cases/

Realistically they are probably one of very few countries that can enforce strict quarantine on millions, build entire hospitals in a couple of days, manufacture 1000s of pieces of new equipment as it's needed etc. And yes, this is probably in part due to their disregard for human rights and whatnot. China were slow in the beginning, but when this goes big in countries like Afghanistan and India it's hard to imagine them being able to contain it.

fiyaqbl,-0.9939,-0.4754,"Far more dangerous than the flu. From /u/HafomengThe virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.  1. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)] .  2. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)] . This makes it much more difficult to control.  3. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)]. 4. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)] . 5. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.  6. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21). Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. This virus is potentially devastating if containment measures fail. Far worse than the seasonal flu.",I have read everything from “this is apocalyptic” to “it’s just a bad flu”.

This pretty much means that they are only testing cases that need extraordinary intervention... But it will not even come close to identifying or stopping spread by any means. As a matter of fact this one requirement before testing pretty much GUARANTEES that this is going to become something that will spread like wild fire. The doctor from China was warning last week that this thing was going to spread to 60% of their population and they were welding people into their homes. We are not even willing to test people with symptoms that fail testing a Flu panel.THIS should be the standard: If you look like you have the flu, but a Flu test shows negative... Test for the damn COVID-19 virus immediately! Because until you do, there is NO urgency to quarantine.This whole emergency response plan is being  run by people who have the wrong priorities... This whole thing is going to go off the deep end, not because we couldn't have stopped it but because the CDC and DHHS are making it impossible to stop it. The one case of P2P unknown source only happened because a army of doctors threatened the CDC... And now they change the rules, but only enough to give us enough data to be unable to make a difference in the spread.

The 15-19 age group is the largest in Mongolia; in 2009 about 40% of the population was under 19 years old. The crux of the matter is that, if the government didn’t enact these strong measures, the reality is a large proportion of the children population would be at risk.

The whistleblower’s lawyers provided a copy of a redacted 24-page complaint to The Washington Post. A spokesman for the Office of the Special Counsel said he could not comment on complaints filed with the office.The complaint alleges that HHS staff were “improperly deployed” and were “not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation.” The complaint also alleges that the workers were [potentially exposed to coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-updates/2020/02/22/72dd19de-54ea-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_9&itid=lk_inline_manual_9) because appropriate steps were not taken to protect them, and staff were not trained in wearing personal protective equipment, even though they had face-to-face contact with returning passengers. The workers were in contact with passengers in an airplane hangar where evacuees were received and on two other occasions: when they helped distribute keys for room assignments and hand out colored ribbons for identification purposes.“We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act. We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time,” HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said.In her complaint, the whistleblower states that “appropriate steps were not taken to quarantine, monitor, or test \[the workers\] during their deployment and upon their return home.” The repatriated Americans were [among those evacuated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-americans/2020/02/20/b6f54cae-5279-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_13&itid=lk_inline_manual_13) from Wuhan and [quarantined on military bases in California and Texas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/for-americans-a-nightmare-escaping-wuhan-then-14-days-of-quarantine/2020/02/05/d303daca-4859-11ea-8124-0ca81effcdfb_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_13&itid=lk_inline_manual_13) because they were considered at high risk for contracting the flu-like illness.About 14 ACF personnel were sent to March Air Force base in Riverside County, California, and another team of about 13 ACF personnel were sent to Travis Air Force in Fairfield, California, according to the complaint and the whistleblower’s lawyer, Ari Wilkenfeld. Several people within HHS voiced objection to sending the ACF personnel to receive passengers, according to a person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.A second person familiar with the situation said the workers were not tested for coronavirus because none of them met the criteria for testing, which only calls for testing people who had recent travel to China or contact with a confirmed case. The workers also did not exhibit any symptoms, the person said. If they had, appropriate protocol would have been followed.The deployments took place Jan. 28 to 31, around the time when the first planeload of evacuees arrived at March, and Feb. 2 to Feb. 7, during the time when additional flights were arriving at Travis. The planes each carried about 200 Americans who were repatriated from Wuhan.After their deployments, the workers returned to their normal duties, some taking commercial airline flights to return to their offices around the country, the lawyers said.“Our client was concerned that ACF staff — who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus — were allowed to leave quarantined areas and return to their communities, where they may have spread the coronavirus to others,” said Lauren Naylor, one of the whistleblower’s lawyers.The whistleblower is also seeking assistance from the office of Rep. Jimmy Gomez, (D-Ca.), a member of the House Ways and Means committee and vice chair of the House Oversight Committee, according to a Gomez spokesman.During a hearing Thursday, Gomez asked Azar whether any employees from the Administration for Children and Families could have been sent to help with the repatriation of Americans from Wuhan, China without any training in emergency response. Azar replied that some ACF employees were involved.Asked what sort of health and safety training the personnel received, and whether any of them were exposed to high-risk evacuees from China, Azar said: “They never should have been without P.P.E,” referring to personal protective equipment.Continued in next comment:","U.S. workers without protective gear assisted coronavirus evacuees, HHS whistleblower says",2020-02-27 13:19:56,/r/Coronavirus/comments/faj5r7/us_workers_without_protective_gear_assisted/

fiyspvj,-0.974,-0.34,"One of my degrees is International Security and Intelligence.  My focus was on infrastructure and resource (including people) security. This was really early when the degree was first offered, so many people still had the Cold War on the brain; and so rather than dealing with things like cyber security, WMDs were seen as the serious threat. First: The flu is NOT worse. information is sketchy, but the mortality rate for healthy persons under 60 seems to be about 1%, or roughly ten times more lethal the a 'normal' strain of the flu, and over three times more lethal than the often hyped H1N1. It is true that the various strains of the flu have killed more people so far this year, but they have also already infected orders of magnitude more.Second: The infection rate is only slowing down in China, and nowhere else. And they are taking extreme measures to ensure this happens. Since China has so far had the vast majority of the cases, this can cause an ill informed parson to believe that the infection is slowing down, when in most of the world it is only beginning.Third: Last I checked there have been infections in thirty countries on four continents. That is true it is mostly a problem in SE Asia, for now. But that doesn't mean that will always be the case.Last: My post sounds kind of doom and gloom, but you shouldn't take it that way. I am railing against your professors who are sticking their heads in the sand. The truth is this virus is bad, but it is not apocalyptic bad. The world will not end and society will not crumble. Honestly it's lethality rate is low enough that, even in a worst case ""everybody-in-the-world-gets-it"" scenario, over the next few years more people will have died from natural causes then CORVID-19.If my post sounds schizophrenic, I apologize.

fizadl4,-0.9931,0.0,"U.S. Health Workers Responding to Coronavirus Lacked Training and Protective Gear, Whistle-Blower SaysTeam members were not properly trained, lacked necessary gear and moved freely around and off military bases where Americans were quarantined, a complaint says.By Emily Cochrane, Noah Weiland and Margot Sanger-KatzFeb. 27, 2020Updated 8:33 p.m. ET229WASHINGTON — Federal health employees interacted with Americans quarantined for possible exposure to the coronavirus without proper medical training or protective gear, then scattered into the general population, according to a government whistle-blower who lawmakers say faced retaliation for reporting concerns.The team was “improperly deployed” to two military bases in California to assist the processing of Americans who had been evacuated from coronavirus hot zones in China and elsewhere, according to a portion of a narrative account shared with Congress and obtained by The New York Times ahead of a formal complaint to the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent government agency that handles federal whistle-blower complaints.Staff members from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families were sent to Travis Air Force Base and March Air Reserve Base in late January and early February and were ordered to enter quarantined areas, including a hangar where coronavirus evacuees were being received, the complaint said. They were not provided safety-protocol training until five days into their assignment, said the whistle-blower, who is described as a senior leader at the health agency.Without proper training or equipment, some of the exposed staff members moved freely around and off the bases, with at least one person staying in a nearby hotel and leaving California on a commercial flight. Many were unaware of the need to test their temperatures three times a day.“I soon began to field panicked calls from my leadership team and deployed staff members expressing concerns with the lack of H.H.S. communication and coordination, staff being sent into quarantined areas without personal protective equipment, training or experience in managing public health emergencies, safety protocols and the potential danger to both themselves and members of the public they come into contact with,” the whistle-blower wrote. House Democrats said on Thursday that the official who voiced concerns to superiors about the situation was subjected to professional retaliation.In a statement on Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged the complaint, which was first reported by The Washington Post, without elaborating.“We take all whistle-blower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act,” said Caitlin B. Oakley, a deputy assistant secretary and a national spokeswoman for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. “We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time.”A former department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that two senior officials there who were directly involved with the situation believed the whistle-blower was making the accusations in an effort to protect their job after being told they would be reassigned. The officials involved contended that the teams were not in any danger, the person said, and that testing was not done because none of the personnel showed symptoms of being sick.The account surfaced as President Trump seeks to play down the danger of a domestic coronavirus outbreak amid bipartisan concern about a sluggish and disjointed response by the administration to an illness that public health officials have said is likely to spread across the United States. The first American case of coronavirus in a patient with no known contact with hot zones or other coronavirus patients emerged this week near Travis Air Force Base.The complaint raised questions about whether the Trump administration had taken adequate precautions in its handling of the virus, and whether Mr. Trump’s minimization of the risks had been mirrored by other top officials when confronted with potentially disturbing developments.The workers who were sent to the scene were not medical professionals and usually help low-income Americans returning to the United States from foreign countries during crises.In a narrative prepared for Congress, the whistle-blower painted a grim portrait of staff members who found themselves suddenly thrust into a federal effort to confront the coronavirus in the United States. The whistle-blower said their own health concerns were dismissed by senior administration officials as detrimental to staff “morale.” They were “admonished,” the complainant said, and “accused of not being team players,” and had their “mental health and emotional stability questioned.”After a phone call with health agency leaders to raise their fears about exposure to the virus, the staff members described a “whitewashing” of the situation, characterizing the response as “corrupt” and a “cover-up,” according to the narrative, and telling the whistle-blower that senior officials had treated them as a “nuisance” and did not want to hear their worries about health and safety.A separate team not connected to the whistle-blower complaint was dispatched to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego to help coronavirus evacuees from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak, according to two people with direct knowledge of the effort. One of those people said they also lacked protective gear.At Miramar, one of the people said, guidelines were unclear and sometimes contradictory, and different teams appeared to be following different protocols. Professional cleaning crews in full protective gear — eye and respiratory protection and gloves — cleaned the quarantine area at the same time that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doctors wearing business suits interacted with evacuees at close range.Standards were lax at first, this person said, but once patients appeared to become sick, workers began wearing personal protective equipment. One member of the team is now back at work and has yet to be tested for coronavirus exposure, the person added, although the C.D.C. sends daily texts checking in on whether they have symptoms.Representative Jimmy Gomez, Democrat of California, whose office received the whistle-blower complaint, appeared to allude to it on Thursday morning at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing with Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services.To your knowledge, were any of the A.C.F. employees exposed to high-risk evacuees from China?” Mr. Gomez asked Mr. Azar.“They should never have been,” Mr. Azar responded, unless they had special suits designed to protect against infection. “To maintain quarantine, that should be the case.”Mr. Gomez said his understanding was that the teams sent to March and Travis air bases faced a “chaotic” situation.“I would not accept your proposition that it was chaotic at all times,” Mr. Azar said. “I am not aware of any violation of quarantine or isolation protocols.”March air base in Riverside, Calif., housed 195 people evacuated from Wuhan, China, for 14 days beginning in late January, while Travis in Northern California has housed a number of quarantined people in recent weeks, including some of the nearly 400 Americans on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that had docked in Japan.At a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee after the accusations surfaced, William A. Walters, a top medical official at the State Department, denied that any protocols had been broken.“Every precaution has been taken,” said Dr. Walters, the head of operational medicine at the department’s Bureau of Medical Services. “I can say unequivocally that everyone involved with those evacuations were properly equipped and trained.”Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the complaint appeared to be part of a pattern of ineptitude and mistrust of civil servants by the Trump administration.“The president has spent years assaulting our health care system, draining resources from key health programs, and showing utter disdain for career federal employees who are the backbone of our government,” Mr. Neal said in a statement provided to The Times. “It’s sadly no surprise we’re seeing this degree of ineptitude during a terrible crisis.”Mr. Neal and Mr. Gomez requested additional information on Thursday evening from Mr. Azar, from the inspector general’s office at the Department of Health and Human Services and from the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, citing the concerns raised in the whistle-blower report.In a pair of letters, Mr. Neal and Mr. Gomez formally requested a briefing from Mr. Azar within a week, saying that they were “deeply troubled that H.H.S. seems to have ignored valid public health concerns” as well as reports that the agency had retaliated against the whistle-blower instead of taking action.In the letter to the Government Accountability Office, they expressed concerns that “management decisions at H.H.S. could have contributed to the spread of the virus within the United States.”Michael D.

fiyuadv,-0.9864,0.0,"Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sent more than a dozen workers to receive the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak,without proper training for infection control or appropriate protective gear, according to a whistleblower complaint.The workers did not show symptoms of infection and were not tested for the virus,according to lawyers for the whistleblower, a senior HHS official based in Washington who oversees workers at the Administration for Children and Families, a unit within HHS.The whistleblower is seeking federal protection, alleging she was unfairly and improperly reassigned after raising concerns about the safety of these workers to HHS officials, including those within the office of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. She was told Feb. 19 that if she does not accept the new position in 15 days, which is March 5, she would be terminated.The whistleblower has decades of experience in the field, received two HHS department awards from Azar last year and has received the highest performance evaluations, her lawyers said.The complaint was filed Wednesday with the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal watchdog agency. The whistleblower’s lawyers provided a copy of a redacted 24-page complaint to The Washington Post. A spokesman for the Office of the Special Counsel said he could not comment on complaints filed with the office.The complaint alleges HHS staff were “improperly deployed” and were “not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation.” The complaint also alleges the workers were potentially exposed to coronavirusbecause appropriate steps were not taken to protect them and staffers were not trained in wearing personal protective equipment, even though they had face-to-face contact with returning passengers. The workers were in contact with passengers in an airplane hangar where evacuees were received and on two other occasions: when they helped distribute keys for room assignments and hand out colored ribbons for identification purposes.In some instances, the teams were working alongside personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in “full gown, gloves and hazmat attire,” the complaint said.“We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act. We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time,” HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said.The whistleblower, in her complaint, states that “appropriate steps were not taken to quarantine, monitor, or test [the workers] during their deployment and upon their return home.” The repatriated Americans were among those evacuatedfrom Wuhan and quarantined on military bases in California and Texas because they were considered at high risk for contracting the flu-like illness.About 14 personnel from the Administration for Children and Families, or ACF, were sent to March Air Force base in Riverside County, Calif., and another team of about 13 ACF personnel were sent to Travis Air Force in Solano County, Calif., according to the complaint and the whistleblower’s lawyer, Ari Wilkenfeld. In Solano County this week, the first U.S. patient was confirmed to be infected with coronavirus who did not travel to a region where it is spreading or have known contact with someone diagnosed with the disease.Several people within HHS voiced objection to sending the ACF personnel to receive passengers, according to a person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.A second person familiar with the situation said the workers were not tested for coronavirus because none of them met the criteria, which was restricted at that time to people with symptoms and either a recent trip to China or close contact with a person confirmed to be infected with covid19. If the workers had exhibited symptoms, appropriate protocol would have been followed.The deployments took place Jan. 28 to 31, around the time when the first planeload of evacuees arrived at March, and Feb. 2 to Feb. 7, during the time when additional flights were arriving at Travis. The planes each carried about 200 Americans who were repatriated from Wuhan.After their deployments, the workers returned to their normal duties, some taking commercial airline flights to return to their offices around the country, the lawyers said.“Our client was concerned that ACF staff — who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus — were allowed to leave quarantined areas and return to their communities, where they may have spread the coronavirus to others,” said Lauren Naylor, one of the whistleblower’s lawyers.The whistleblower is also seeking assistance from the office of Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), a member of the House Ways and Means committee and vice chair of the House Oversight Committee, according to a Gomez spokesman.During a hearing Thursday, Gomez asked Azar whether any employees from ACF could have been sent to help with the repatriation of Americans from Wuhan without any training in emergency response. Azar replied that some ACF employees were involved.Asked what sort of health and safety training the personnel received and whether any of them were exposed to high-risk evacuees from China, Azar said: “They never should have been without P.P.E,” referring to personal protective equipment.Asked whether any protocols may have been broken, given the urgency on the ground, Azar replied urgency was never a reason for breaking safety protocols.“I don’t believe that has taken place,” Azar said said, adding that health and safety protocols “should always be followed.” He said he did not personally know the names of the team, but other department officials did. Pressed by Gomez what the department would do if untrained employees were exposed to the virus, Azar said: “I’d want to know the full facts, and we’d take appropriate remedial efforts.”The whistleblower said she received an email Jan. 25 about a potential deployment within ACF to support repatriation of the evacuated Americans, according to her lawyer. She initially supported the efforts because they had the “appearance that this was within ACF’s scope,” Naylor said. But later, she discovered the teams were dispatched without her knowledge by other senior officials at HHS. It was part of the agency’s “all-hands-on-deck” mission, Naylor said, but it broke agency protocol about what kinds of employees should respond to health emergencies. The whistleblower said she later found out about the deployment when she heard directly from some employees and other senior officials at HHS.Some workers expressed concern about the lack of protective gear to the ACF team leader on the ground. That person joined ACF in September and had “no training or experience in any federal emergency management, public health emergency response, or safety or operational protocols to run the mission,” the complaint states.ACF personnel typically deal with supporting people recovering from natural disasters, such as floods and fires, and helping victims apply for temporary assistance, all of which are under the category of human services, the whistleblower’s lawyers said. HHS officials broke established protocols for emergency support by sending ACF workers to a health emergency for which they have no training, Naylor said. ACF, which has about 1,300 employees, has been criticized in recent years because of its role in sheltering and taking custody of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border who were separated from family members by the Department of Homeland Security.The workers’ concerns about potential exposure to coronavirus were not addressed, the whistleblower’s lawyers said.“She was involuntarily assigned to a position in a subject matter where she has no expertise,” Wilkenfeld, her lawyer, said in an interview Thursday. The agency said the reason for the reassignment was “necessary to meet the needs of the department,” according to a memo she received. “If I did not accept involuntary reassignment, I would be terminated from federal service through adverse personnel action,” according to her complaint.Amy Goldstein contributed to this report.",US Workers Without Protective Gear Assisted Coronavirus Evacuees HHS Whistleblower Says,2020-02-27 14:51:16,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fakk9a/us_workers_without_protective_gear_assisted/

fiz0x9t,-0.7388,0.4019,"Quant here. There is substantial risk to the economy even from a mild epidemic.There is something called a 'supply chain' which is the process raw materials go through to become finished goods. Your cell phone started out as raw materials under ground and gradually through incremental improvements by thousands of companies everything came together into the phone in your pocket.For the last 40 years the world has been going through something we now call 'Globalization' which basically just means that the average goods and services a person receives are increasingly coming from diverse parts of the world.Also about 40 years ago something called 'Just in Time Manufacturing' was developed which essentially created very efficient supply chains by eliminating the need for factories to hold input materials in stockpile. Instead, factories started coordinating the delivery of needed materials to arrive just in time for production.The combination of these two economic innovations have created a massive amounts of market efficiency resulting in unprecedented growth and wealth creation. No longer does one country need to manufacture all the goods it's citizens consume, it can specialize and trade for the difference. The world has become completely interconnected and optimized for efficiency but the reality is that all of this is at the expense of stability.Supply chains are lean and far reaching but unstable. A disruption at a factory making axles in China suddenly prevents a car assembly plant in Detroit from continuing work which causes dealerships to miss deliveries and on and on the disruption ripples through the economy. Along the way some companies unable to work start missing debt payments then bankruptcies that pile up suddenly cause bank failures and so on and so on.Our modern Globalized economy has NEVER faced a disruption like this before and no one knows how it's going to play out.

fiyy6ho,-0.9232,-0.25,"Something I've thought of before... Visibility can be very scary in times like these. Imagine people could asses real-time odds of failure of, say, popular machinery of transportation, i. E. cars, planes, bikes etc while they're being used. When using public transportation, we all deal with odds that can turn against us at the spur of the moment. Sometimes it just comes down to something as simple as a screw being loose. With this virus it could be someone coughing, and the only difference between the two is that we have a certain merit of definite knowledge on the virus. Being aware of such hypothesized "" odds of failure"" the way we're aware of sick people right now would make people think twice about things like driving their car on the highway. It's just that we mostly live in some sort of blissful and faithful (and important) state of ignorance, hoping that the 100 people who assembled your car did so in good faith, whilst the odds of someone being lazy in the process can actually very realistically turn against you at the wrong time. While some risks can definitely be avoided, we often also have to continue our merry way and put faith in things that are not always up to us to decideThe odds of catching COVID19 might not reflect this idea well, but due to the fact that people are so tightly focused in on the virus and its symptoms to somewhat objectively asses the danger of contracting,  the whole ordeal suddenly becomes very scary and real. Yet, at the same time, we willingly expose ourselves to potential dangers in our day to day lives to achieve something as simple as cutting down travel time by taking an Uber instead of walking. Even though the odds might not match up comparing a virus infection to an Uber driver that drives into a tree, and I'm definitely not trying to downplay the virus by saying the following, we should be mindful of danger and death as we're more often than not surrounded by it.

fiz0eev,-0.3164,0.0,"I had asked a similar question as I am on biologics too for my Psoriasis, an autoimmune disease. (My drug, Tremfya is a biologic like your Humira) I'm copying this from a previous post.It's important to note that biologics typically target a specific protein. For example cosentyx targets inf-17. Stelara targets il12 and 23 and TREMFYA is il-23 Each of these cytokines plays different roles in the immune response (check out the first link below to see specific examples). In the link below you can see that people with il-17 are at higher risk for fungal infections like candida while il-6 blockers are more likely to get other infections.It seems that we have specific sections of our immune system which are compromised but that is different than say someone with diabetes. High blood sugar among other complications from diabetes lowers overall immunity. It has a much greater impact on many parts of the immune system. The second link is a well sourced explanation of all the ways diabetes impacts the immune system.So as you can see if we compare our suppression of one protein to the effects of diabetes there is clearly a difference. So while I think it would be prudent to avoid being sick I don't believe we are in the same extent immunocompromised as people we see dying from the coronavirus . Should it start to spread elsewhere in the world as significantly as it is in China then you could come off your meds for a bit but I don't think you have to worry about being in a high risk class where death is more likely. Obviously I'm assuming you have no other ailments and are otherwise a healthy individual.Hope this helps!https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5481723/http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/diabetes-mellitus-and-infectious-diseases-controlling-chronic-hyperglycemia/",Autoimmune Patients,2020-02-27 15:47:02,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fald00/autoimmune_patients/

fiz76mm,0.9538,0.4767,"Pence’s new mission on coronavirus: A controlled messageBy Paul Waldman Opinion writerFeb. 27, 2020 at 4:33 p.m. ESTIf you’re confused by the fact that President Trump keeps saying that the coronavirus is nothing to worry about while officials who actually deal with infectious diseases keep warning of a potential public health crisis, don’t worry. Now that Vice President Pence has taken over the coronavirus task force, he’s making sure the flow of information will be curtailed.The New York Times reports:>The White House moved on Thursday to tighten control of coronavirus messaging by government health officials and scientists, directing them to coordinate all statements and public appearance with the office of Vice President Mike Pence, according to several officials familiar with the new approach.Here’s the goal of this reorganization:>The vice president’s first move appeared to be aimed at preventing the kind of contradictory statements from White House officials and top government health officials that have plagued the administration’s response. Even during his news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Trump rejected the assessment from a top health official that it was inevitable that the coronavirus would spread more broadly inside the United States.>Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the country’s leading experts on viruses and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told associates that the White House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.Two things. First, Fauci is probably the most respected public health official in the United States; there is no one better equipped to explain what is happening with the coronavirus, what is likely to happen, and how we should react to it. Now, he’s been muzzled.Second, while one certainly wants to avoid contradictory statements from the government, the reason this happens is that Trump keeps saying things that are either blatantly untrue or simply absurd.This is a persistent theme of the Trump presidency: He says things that are false or ridiculous, and then everyone who works for him has to scramble to either retcon them into existence or just pretend that he’s right and the moon is made of green cheese.Just last week, we learned that the national security adviser sometimes begins meetings “by distributing printouts of Mr. Trump’s latest tweets on the subject at hand” so officials can “find ways of justifying, enacting or explaining Mr. Trump’s policy, not to advise the president on what it should be,"" as the Times reported.Trump’s news conference on Wednesday showed this in action. Trump bragged about the economy, attacked Democrats, displayed mind-boggling ignorance about how the government works, and said boosterish things that directly contradicted warnings from experts.Something else was notable as well: a stark difference in the comments from Pence and Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar on one hand, and Fauci and Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the other.Here are some remarkable excerpts from Azar’s comments:>Thank you, Mr. President, for gathering your public health experts here today and for your strong leadership in keeping America safe. ... The President’s early and decisive actions, including travel restrictions, have succeeded in buying us incredibly valuable time. ... The President’s actions taken with the strong support of his scientific advisors have proven to be appropriate, wise, and well-calibrated to the situation. ... Because of this hard work and the President’s leadership, the immediate risk to the American public has been and continues to be low.I guess if you want to keep your job, that kind of commitment to flattery is what you have to show in an administration currently embarking on a purge of disloyal officials.But when it was time for the career civil servants to speak, they addressed the issue without mentioning Trump at all. You could almost feel him seething in the background.In fact, Fauci directly contradicted Trump on one vital question. Trump claimed that a vaccine for this virus is right around the corner: “The vaccine is coming along well. And in speaking to the doctors, we think this is something that we can develop fairly rapidly.”But when Fauci spoke, he made clear that while they hope to identify a vaccine in the next few months, even if they do it will take at least a year before it could be verified to be safe and be ready to be distributed.“If this virus — which we have every reason to believe it is quite conceivable that it will happen — will go beyond just a season and come back and recycle next year — if that’s the case, we hope to have a vaccine,” he said.So we’re not going to get any more of that. If everything the government tells us comes through Pence, it will all be delivered amidst encomiums to the boundless majesty and perfection of Donald Trump.I’d like to give Pence the benefit of the doubt that he can manage the coronavirus response well. Some have said Trump should have chosen someone with a medical background, but while that might be helpful, you also need someone who understands the various agencies involved and has the authority to get people and organizations to follow instructions quickly.But the beginning of this effort is not promising. Pence announced on Thursday that he has added to the coronavirus task force White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, whose main job appears to be going on television to praise Trump’s economic genius. What Kudlow could contribute to a public health crisis is unclear, but this suggests that political considerations — in other words, the aggrandizement of the president — are among the highest priorities.It’s entirely possible, if not likely, that the need to protect Trump politically will lead to the sidelining of key professionals, less accurate information reaching the public, and a less efficient response. If the government handles this challenge well, it may be in spite of, not because of, the White House’s efforts.Let’s hope the consequences aren’t as dire as we fear.",All U.S. Public Health Officials Required To Get Approval From Vice President Mike Pence Before Any Public Statements Concerning Coronavirus,2020-02-27 16:29:52,/r/Coronavirus/comments/falyde/all_us_public_health_officials_required_to_get/

[note past tense saying we did a good job to close borders from certain areas....did not say our borders are very secure from virus] 2. but I really want to be responsible for this country. If it means placing a very strong situation on the border so people can’t come into our country from a country that is infected, we’re doing that and we’ve already done it with numerous countries [note: in this instance I agree he suggests that we have placed a very strong situation (which I guess means secure but word not used) in relation to border.  So one instance so far be suggest we have placed strong measures on birder]. 3. Our borders are very controlled. Our flights in from certain areas that we’re talking about are very controlled. [he says our borders are controlled. Not that our borders “are very secure from this virus”. Just that we have controlled borders which presumably will help in fighting to keep virus out]4. I think that we’re doing a really good job in terms of maintaining borders in terms of letting people in, in terms of checking people, [again he does not say our border is very secure from this virus just that we maintain a good border and check people].

The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28\[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)\] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3\[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)\] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.2. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%\[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)\] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%\[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)\] .3. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms\[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)\] . This makes it much more difficult to control.4. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention\[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)\] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu\[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)\].5. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month\[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)\] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days\[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)\] .6. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2\[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)\] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.7. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. *See*, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21).Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations.These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medicalintervention.***If they still insist it's nothing, then stop bothering to convince them.",I’m going mad,2020-02-27 19:24:25,/r/Coronavirus/comments/faoavr/im_going_mad/

This is what's happening in Iran (10.6%) now.If you get overwhelmed because you don't have enough hospital beds, then instead of half (2.5%) of the critical dying, you get all (5%) of the critical dying, because they need a ventilator to breathe.

Outside of Wuhan, the death rate is much lower.Italy (2.5%) is late to the game and playing catch up with testing.Also, there are some academics that estimate that for every 1 person that is mild/severe/critical, there are 1-3 people that are asymptomatic.

Problem- 80% of cases can be mild so people don’t even realize they have it. Another problem let’s say you are a nurse and you get tested for coronavirus because you treated someone with viral pneumonia you have 4 days until you get the results back, in the meantime you are going about your daily life and potentially spreading it to others. Also while you self quarantine at home, cdc says your kids can go to school & no need to notify the school about potential risk. This is what is happening in California right now.

fizr73p,0.7522,0.3612,"I’ll give you a brief history:We originally imported 15 cases from Wuhan. People travelling together (family/tour groups) were infected in small clusters, but it seems this may have occurred prior to arriving in Australia. There was no community transmission and no human to human transmission outside of the clusters who travelled here together. One Wuhan couple, who travelled here to see their daughter, were both infected but she didn’t catch it from them. All of these 15 cases all recovered.We now have 9 further cases from the Diamond Princess. One of those is the case mentioned in this post. She is the wife on another patient but it’s believed she caught it while on the ship, rather than after arriving in Australia. None of these patients have recovered yet. 1 is in serious condition.There has been no cases where origin is not confirmed, and no cases that didn’t have a history with Wuhan or the cruise ship.It was hot during the time of initial 15 infections, but we are two days away from autumn now so it will be interesting to see if that changes with the newer cruise ship cases. In Melbourne right now it is 20 degrees, which puts us in ideal temperatures for transmission. Some of the other states are a bit warmer than us (eg Queensland) so if the temperature hypothesis is correct, they would be more protected.",AUSTRALIA NEW CASE: The wife of the first WA coronavirus victim has been confirmed positive for the virus today.

fizoesk,0.7958,-0.9118,"From a [NYT article about the study](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/health/17flu.html) :> When the Spanish flu reached the United States in the summer of 1918, it seemed to confine itself to military camps. But when it arrived in Philadelphia in September, it struck with a vengeance.> By the time officials there grasped the threat of the virus, it was too late. The disease was rampaging through the population, partly because the city had allowed large public gatherings, including a citywide parade in support of a World War I loan drive, to go on as planned. In four months, more than 12,000 Philadelphians died, an excess death rate of 719 people for every 100,000 inhabitants.> The story was quite different in St. Louis. Two weeks before Philadelphia officials began to react, doctors in St. Louis persuaded the city to require that influenza cases be registered with the health department. And two days after the first civilian cases, police officers helped the department enforce a shutdown of schools, churches and other gathering places. Infected people were quarantined in their homes.> Excess deaths in St. Louis were 347 per 100,000 people, less than half the rate in Philadelphia. Early action appeared to have saved thousands of lives.[...]> Dr. Hatchett, who is a researcher at the National Institutes of Health, said the findings might hold lessons for the 21st century. “When multiple interventions were introduced early, they were very effective in 1918,” he said, “and that certainly offers hope that they would be similarly useful in an epidemic today if we didn’t have an effective vaccine.”> A two-week difference in response times, according to the researchers, is long enough for the number of people infected in an influenza epidemic to double three to five times.> Dr. Martin Cetron, director for global migration and quarantine at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, found reason for optimism in the study results.> “The thing I find encouraging about the Hatchett paper,” he said, “is that when you look back to 1918, you find that those who used nonpharmaceutical measures effectively were able to mitigate the impact of the severe pandemics, and this is consistent with some of the 21st-century simulation models.”","Why was Philadelphia’s death rate double that of St Louis during the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak?

fizu91h,0.0,0.6408,"Note that SARS exhibited a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement, which meant that in the presence of antibodies, it became able to infect immune system cells through the Fc family of receptors in addition to the standard ACE-2 entry route.  Many other coronaviruses can also do this, but not all of them.  Immunization actually makes some coronavirus-caused diseases worse.If SARS-CoV-2 exhibits the same ability, this will be common as antibodies are produced in the first round of infection, antibody levels drop as the acute phase is passed, but the virus isn't completely eradicated.  I think this is incredibly important because it means vaccination might actually be actively harmful and re-infection more dangerous than the initial infection because the immune system(expressing the Fc receptors) would be heavily compromised.

fizpu9i,-0.9707,0.0," CODOGNO - The Italian outbreak of the coronavirus was smoldering ""at least since mid-January"".  From  this conclusion, the task force of epidemiologists, researchers, law  enforcement officers and investigators at work in Milan and within the  red area of ​​the infection is ""one step away"".  Thanks  to genetics, few confirmations separate scientists from the  reconstruction of the link between ""the main epicenter of the epidemic"",  identified between the ten isolated municipalities in the Lower  Lodigiano area and the one called ""secondary"" of Vo ', in the Paduan  area.  A week after the first diagnosis in the Codogno hospital, the identification of the ""patient zero"" remains uncertain.  According  to those who follow the dossier, however, it is in particular that the  hypothesis that the employee of the Unilever of Casalpusterlengo is the  ""patient one"" is wavering.   The  man, 38 years old from Castiglione, spread Covid-19 in the hospital of  the first hospitalization in Codogno and among those who attended for  days once infected, at work and doing sports.  The  hunt for those who involuntarily transformed the area now sealed in  Lombardy into a sort of ""Italian Wuhan"", which then spread to the rest  of the region, in the neighboring areas of Emilia and Northern Italy,  registered a turning point thanks to doctors, operators retirement homes  and pharmacists in centers where the origin of more than 90% of  positive cases is concentrated.  After  the explosion of the emergency between Codogno, Castiglione d'Adda and  Casalpusterlengo, the health professionals reconnected dozens of  patients, not only the elderly, who since mid-January ""have been  affected by strange pneumonia, very high fevers and flu syndromes  associated with unexplained complications ».  Until  February 20, the day on which the first case was ascertained in the  Codogno hospital thanks to the intuition of an anesthesiologist, no  Italian without direct or indirect relations with China had tested  positive.   In the lower Lodigiano area already in January there was a boom, not unnoticed, [of influences and pneumonia.](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&pto=nl&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=it&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.repubblica.it/salute/medicina-e-ricerca/2020/02/25/news/_influenza_8_mila_decessi_all_anno_ma_e_sbagliato_paragonarli_al_coronavirus_-249546412/&usg=ALkJrhjV8nUkTLI0-RZZm3lzT92gIvWJFg)  Unfortunately, no element foreseen by the international health protocols has led him ""to factors unrelated to seasonality"".   «We were all convinced - says Alberto Gandolfi, a general practitioner  in quarantine in Codogno with various infected patients - that those  pneumonia were favored by cold and absence of rain.  Revealed by the plates, they have been treated with the usual antibiotics ».   Now the picture has changed and the truth emerges from medical records  and pharmaceutical recipes of all the patients in the red zone, who for  over a month have been treated for ""normal"" influences and pneumonia.  The majority recovered, but traces of the antibodies against Covid-19 remained in the blood.   After the isolation of the ""Lombard strain"" of the coronavirus in Milan, these are now genetically crossed with each other.   In the laboratory, also in Rome and Pavia, an ever more precise network  of personal relationships, even undeclared, or that the infected  themselves do not remember, takes shape.   ""Between Thursday 20 and Monday 24 February - explains one of the  researchers - we suddenly went from zero to over 200 coronavirus cases  among 50 thousand people in a single territory.   Effect of carpet swabs, but such an acceleration is unprecedented even  in China and is not reflected in the incubation times of Covid-19 "".   For this reason, the ""silent spread"" of the contagion in the Lodi area  is backdated in the last few hours and anyone looking for the truth  about the epidemic in Italy tends to conclude that the ""patient one"",  stable and still intubated at San Matteo in Pavia, may not be such .   Only ""with several unconscious infected in circulation for several  days"" do we explain ""spread, speed and transversality"" of the infection  finally discovered on Thursday 20 in the current ""red zone"".   An area that, although with increasing derogations to allow a partial  recovery of companies and services, isolation could continue.

fizslso,0.6867,0.4767,"so the problem lies with the fact that a lot of people who prep just have bad anxiety and are prepping to quell their anxieties - and it works! for a little bit. every thing you prep then won’t be enough, there will be always something you need to buy until it’s no longer financially feasible (but some do go into debt) i think inherently the stigma around prepping is that a lot (but certainly not all) the people who do it have unchecked mental problems, which the prepping exacerbates but doesn’t cure. for example, if i have OCD and am afraid of leaving the stove on, i might take a picture of it before i leave. this might make me feel better the first time i do it, but eventually it will not be enough, perhaps i will no longer believe my pictures or every timei pass the stove i must take another “just in case something changed” and the fact that i have to take a picture to feel better in the first place is not solving any problems to why i feel like that originally. it’s sort of the same idea with prepping and anxiety. it starts with rice and beans but (if you have the means) could end in a bunker in an extreme case. BASICALLY; prepping can be great. and super helpful: but we must not let ourselves get carried away with it. and always remember that other preppers who are swayed by anxieties will always want other people to follow suit, as it makes them feel less “wrong” if other people are doing it too. also selfish prepping re:buying every mask on the shelf, ends up doing a disservice to the community at large leaving more people will less protection and will probably end up spreading the disease more due to selfishness (but we don’t wanna talk about that here god forbid)","I hope I’m wrong, even if it means me being the guy that gets made fun of.",2020-02-27 22:39:36,/r/Coronavirus/comments/faqle8/i_hope_im_wrong_even_if_it_means_me_being_the_guy/

We supply to one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in China called XiuZheng pharmaceutical group 修正集团 and have sold millions of our n95 respirators to them. We also supply millions of n95 respirators to Xiaomi 小米, the phone company. We've had clients export to Russia, HK and US, though I'm not quite sure the exact logistics they went through. Some clients use freight forwarding companies.The material costs have tripled in the last month alone so our masks are currently more expensive than usual, but people are nonstop purchasing due to the shortages. Hopefully we can help you get what you're looking for.

This does not include shipping cost by SF Express which will be Cash on Delivery. It also does not include 10% taxes if applicable. Please keep in mind that material prices are constantly shifting so this may be out of date when you see this.
