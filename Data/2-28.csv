The infected person is a 49-year-old man from France who works in Switzerland. His wife may also have been infected, as it says in a media release.So far, it has been an exception in Switzerland because it does not appear to have been infected in Italy. It is not known where the man is currently, whether in his home country of France or at the University Hospital in Lausanne.The government of Vaud wants to speak at a press conference on the case on Friday at 11.30 a.m. There is no cause for concern, she says. The infected was isolated very quickly.The other seven coronavirus cases in Switzerland, in the cantons of Aargau, Basel-Stadt, Geneva, Graubünden, Ticino and Zurich, were all in northern Italy before they returned to Switzerland.Trace to France?In the case of the sick in the canton of Vaud, the trail could lead to his homeland France. There, the number of infected people increased from 18 to 38 on Thursday. There were also two new cases in the Haute-Savoie department, with a total of four infected people reported there. The region borders on Geneva, Lake Geneva and the Valais.According to the French daily Le Parisien, the source of the infection in Haute-Savoie comes from a 64-year-old man. He returned from Lombardy and infected his wife. The two were hospitalized last Monday. The couple's daughter and friend were also reported infected on Thursday.However, it is not clear whether there is a connection to the Vaud case. The authorities only announced today at noon where the Frenchman comes from, as they told the French daily Le Dauphiné libéré.","New case in Vaud, Switzerland",2020-02-28 00:17:57,/r/Coronavirus/comments/farjwr/new_case_in_vaud_switzerland/

They also put every person who had contact in quarantine for up to 14 days or until they tested 2 times negativ. I really hope this measurement will contain the virus.

fj050jv,-0.9824,0.0,"Great essay in Unherd today on societal shifts from pandemics. [Will coronavirus change the world?](https://unherd.com/2020/02/how-coronavirus-will-change-our-culture/) Lots of discussion on what changed socially after the Black Death (the end of surfdom! Printing press! Mistrust of the Church!), and then what the author (Ed West) expects from this pandemic:“Perhaps it will increase pressure for reform in China and Iran, for example, or speed up the decoupling of the global economy. In the US universal healthcare may become a more urgent issue, especially if the country is badly affected and the prohibitive cost of testing is implicated.More generally, it may spark more irritation with the sort of complacent, high-status, FT-reading brahmins who comprise our modern clergy, the sort of people who like to explain how the world is divided into open vs. closed —because they’re the least vulnerable to open systems.Their complacency on this issue arguably echoes their complacency about globalism generally, and an inability to see what really matters. From the time the virus first emerged, we’ve heard the same sort of platitudes we’re told about everything else: how the biggest danger facing us is ‘prejudice’ — not the actual fatal disease — and that the coronavirus “knows no borders”.By contrast, those on the outside Right have noted how open societies seem especially vulnerable to a disease of globalisation, and the political alignment of a worldwide pandemic becomes obvious.Contagious diseases historically raised fear of the outgroup, and already we have seen low-level violence against east Asians in Italy. We’re not going to get pogroms now, partly because children are largely unaffected — the fatality rate for the 0-9s in China still 0 per cent of the 416 confirmed cases —and that’s what really drives terror, but plagues do draw out our most atavistic fears. There is a theory that xenophobia is an evolutionary response to pathogens, since strangers are more likely to carry diseases that the in-group has no immunity to, and that’s why conservatives respond more strongly to disgust and value purity and cleanliness.If the disease spreads, due to a failure to take measures quickly enough, then it will only increase people’s problem with globalisation. Alternatively, the lesson might be, as with aircraft safety, that well-co-ordinated international groups of experts are pretty effective at dealing with major problems, and should therefore be given more power. Although a pessimistic Tory, I’m certainly hoping for a Pinkerite Whiggish outcome.One important change might be the way we see the least valued members of society. Our economy is especially vulnerable because, with three-quarters of children having two working parents, once the schools are shut then a huge chunk of the workforce needs to become “economically inactive”, as the government describes childcare. With communal clubs not an option, people my age would normally recruit their parents into babysitting duties, but for an illness that kills maybe one in six old people, that’s too much of a risk.Perhaps, just as the Black Death perversely raised the value of the peasantry, so coronavirus will do the same for the elderly. Already people up and down the country are checking up on parents to make sure they’ve got alcohol spray, masks and gloves, and protect themselves from the virus. Already the illness has brought about a small cultural change.”",Coronavirus as societal shift,2020-02-28 00:37:14,/r/Coronavirus/comments/farqad/coronavirus_as_societal_shift/

Everything is to move to video/tele conferencing whenever possible. Even so far as to take precautions to urge people to no longer shake hands or have any other bodily contact with people. Have everyone disinfect their work areas when they arrive and before they leave. Wash hands multiple times a day, etc.With telling my wife, I finally realized I can't talk to her any more about it because she believes it's all fake news to stop protesting in China and Japan and even here in the US. It's big govt taking back control and no one is in anymore danger than we were with things like the bird flu. She also thinks since the media is controlled by the left, it's an orchestration to make Trump look bad and blame him for the market crash. Upon just  now hearing those words, my frustration set in with her blowing this all off as if it's just another day and it doesn't impact our lives in any way.I'm not expecting her to panic, prep like crazy, but to just recognize, as I read here, that this may be something we have to live with for a while. I understand as one report came out, while not now, but prepare for the realization that schools across the US might close for an entire month, work might shut down for weeks at a time, this has the chance to interrupt our lives if it gets bad enough.I hope that the world takes this serious enough to stop it, to prove her right that it will be kept under control...but there's also a part of me that wants this to spread like wildfire and make this a way of living for a while until a vaccine can be created. A way of living being stay at home whenever possible, wear a mask if you have to go to work or buy food. Companies shutting down when enough people are sick to help stop the spread. I'd like to see a transition in our economy to take care of people, not just make the rich richer. I fear the world is still trying to hide just enough information to keep everyone working and going about theirs lives like nothing is going on when in reality no one has control of this virus and no one knows how to stop it.Best of luck to you all.",Why don't people take this seriously?,2020-02-28 03:10:09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fat5wo/why_dont_people_take_this_seriously/

With the death of dr Li and the ever intensifying crackdown on freedom in light of this epidemic, Chinese people and the its millennial and gen z in particular, have become completely disillusioned and cynical with the ruling communist regime. When young people resign themselves to a life of cynicism, they won't work nearby as hard as their parents and are giving up their dreams and ambitions and relegating themselves to a life of mediocrity with no hope for advancement. This will cut right into China's productivity and  growth as the Chinese economy and society become stagnant.

The best example I think is in Ningbo where a man contracted COVID-19 without a travel history to Wuhan and without any direct or close contact with any other known infected person (he had been at home, only went outside briefly to buy vegetables). His case was a complete mystery, until Chinese government used the extensive surveillance network with facial recognition technology cross-referenced with the face data of all confirmed cases of those who had the virus. Eventually they found out that while buying vegetables he stood in the same spot as someone who was later found to be infected by the virus for around ~15 seconds a few minutes after they had left that spot. The point is that in any other country in the world that would not have been possible. People on this board praise Signapore's contact tracing measures but China is really on an entirely different level when it comes to this stuff.

The Mexico City case is a man in his 30’s who visited Northern Italy two weeks ago, and returned to the country last Saturday. According to federal health authorities he started developing symptoms the next day after he returned and didn’t seek medical attention until yesterday. He is currently admitted at the facilities of the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases locates in Mexico City, where (according to doctors) he is in stable conditions. As for the individual in Sinaloa state, we are completely in the dark. We know nothing besides a local lab confirmation and that he is currently being isolated at an “hotel room” somewhere in the state (I’m thinking  in the cities of Culiacán, Mazatlán, Los Mochis and Topolobambo, as these are the most important for the Sinaloa state. This is a conjecture of mine based on my limited knowledge of the Sinaloa state and the little information currently available). My source is Milenio.com, website for Milenio newspaper (in Spanish).

China right now is definitely the best place to be if you catch the virus. They are well prepared, have a mot of experience, tried a lot of method. And the most important thing is that they actually take this thing very serious. Plus, your family is there with you, so still, not the best situation, but at the bright side I think you have the better chance than the rest of US and UK2. This is just my opinion, but I think the reason you have to quarantine for 14 days is mainly because you returned from Korea. Right now Korea is the biggest virus hot spot outside of Wuhan, and even Chinese gorvement have some kind of travel limited between 2 countries. The chances of catching the virus from your short flight over there is still remains, but is probably for caution than actual threat.Long story short, I still think you are doing fine, try to ease your mind with other leisure, this is a time for soap opera or start a book, its better than over think about the situation.Cheer and best luck for you from Viet Nam",My journey as an American living in China,2020-02-28 05:22:36,/r/Coronavirus/comments/faumpd/my_journey_as_an_american_living_in_china/

I have actually read the prospectus for these bonds and the purpose of them is to provide surge funding to poor countries PRIOR to the new dieses becoming a WHO declared pandemic.  I am 100% sure there is no requirement for a pandemic to be declared by WHO before these catastrophe bonds have to pay.  There are other events and tests that must happen (certain number of deaths worldwide and 20 deaths in IDA (think really poor) countries).  And some other test about increasing number of cases and certain rolling death average. But all hard coded into deal.  NO pandemic has to be declared. As I said purpose of deal as written is to attempt to avoid (by giving money to really poor countries early on) a pandemic.  Therefore the following in article are simply fake news and clickbait: “Though such concerns are valid, there is also evidence that a particular class of bonds issued by the World Bank that are closely related to official declarations of pandemics may also be responsible for having steered WHO and CDC officials away from using this term”In June 2017, the World Bank announced the creation of “specialized bonds” that would be used to fund the previously created Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) in the event of an officially-recognized (i.e. WHO-recognized) pandemic.”Both of those are lies.",Is Wall Street Behind the Delay in Declaring the Coronavirus Outbreak a “Pandemic”?,2020-02-28 05:24:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/faunjn/is_wall_street_behind_the_delay_in_declaring_the/
fj0fgqh,-0.8602,-0.3182,"In fact if you don’t believe me or the prospectus here is a John Hopkins article that explains at least one reason the deal can’t be contingent on WHO subjectively declaring a pandemic or a PHEiC:  “The bond, like any insurance contract, specifies very precisely in advance the conditions under which the investors (insurers) would lose money. In order to eliminate legal uncertainty and allow the risk to be accurately priced, the triggers for the claim—that is, the definition of the pandemic—need to be very specific and numeric. The definition cannot be anything like “whenever the WHO declares an event a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC),” because that condition is based at least in part on human judgment. If investors knew that they would lose their money whenever an organization makes a judgment call, they would not want to buy the bond.”So instead of relying on WHO to declare something, they have put in metrics (number of deaths, rolling averages, growth rate, geographic regions, deaths in IDA countries) so that the deal (and the investors) can do the computations and verify the numbers, etc.  No private investor would agree to pay millions based on whether the stupid WHO does or does not declare a pandemic.

A coronavirus or Ebola pandemic that kills 2,500 or more people means they lose everything, and the World Bank gets $95 million.

fj11mep,-0.9715,0.0,"This is something that should have happened years ago.  They need to be realistic about relocating supply chains though.  It will take a least a decade to move them to other locales.  It is a complex process with a lot of moving parts to consider. Labor, developing expertise, sourcing materials, finding places to locate factories, etc. takes time.  It also raises the risk of destabilizing geopolitical balances of power, triggering wars in extreme situations.As it stands, we can expect at least two quarters of significant supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak as a baseline assumption, with possible major convulsions to the global financial system as business defaults escalate in affected areas, particularly those reliant on supply chains emanating from China. Leverage problems there can magnify problems moreso and spread it globally to places like Europe, whose banking system was on the precipice even before the outbreak.  It can definitely spiral into a liquidity crisis.The risk here isn't necessarily from mass deaths, unless if the virus isn't effectively contained, or if it leads to major political and social dislocations, or even war in more extreme scenarios. The immediate risk here is major disruptions to supply chains, especially as it spreads globally and quarantines are implemented, thus freezing economic activity throughout the world.China, which is the world's second largest economy, has been under lockdown for almost a month now. It has been the largest quarantine in world history, with almost 770 million people not able to go to work or out shopping at one point. Travel is restricted. Naturally this will have a ripple effect on the rest of the global economy, as so many essential goods, medicines, services and components are produced there. Economies are highly interconnected and China is at the center of major trade flows.Supply chains aren't necessarily linear in nature. If a factory is shut down for more than two weeks, it doesn't mean a two week delay in getting products to consumers. In many instances, if even one component is missing from a product that has hundreds of parts, like a car or a computer, the entire production process is moot. Many times auto parts are produced in multiple places along a supply chain. A component may come from China, another from Korea, another from Mexico or Europe. One disruption in that chain creates a huge problem, and many producers only have about 2 weeks worth of inventory on hand.This is known as just-in-time production. Companies source materials and components in a very strict timeline along multiple places along the supply chain. They do this to increase their operating margins by not having to maintain excess inventory on hand, which is a cost. When those timelines are disrupted, it creates major vulnerabilities and disruptions to global trade. That's why this thing isn't simply a one month hit to the economy. It will have a global effect that lasts for some time, depending upon how long the virus continues to spread and to what extent.Our global supply chains have always been weak and vulnerable. Now a real pandemic is exposing this situation. Effects could linger for years and it might very well change the structure of supply chains, making them shorter and closer to home markets.","US companies are shifting out of China, with 28 per cent polled saying they are setting up, or using alternative supply chains",2020-02-28 07:55:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fawr6z/us_companies_are_shifting_out_of_china_with_28/

Anyway, don’t want to fuel theories or spout misinformation, but it would certainly be interesting if this really has already propagated wildly around the world, but that we are just picking up on it now because of the global alarm and increased testing. Just my two anecdotal cents to add to the dialogue.

Countries still have time to mitigate spread which will buy time to prepare hospitals and supplies so the impact is less severe.

fj0u1jg,0.904,0.0,"Some information I found relevant:  >The Joint Mission began with a detailed workshop with representatives of all of the principal ministries that are leading and/or contributing to the response in China through the National Prevention and Control Task Force. A series of in-depth meetings were then conducted with national level institutions responsible for the management, implementation and evaluation of the response, particularly the National Health Commission and the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). To gain first-hand knowledge on the field level implementation and impact of the national and local response strategy, under a range of epidemiologic and provincial contexts, visits were conducted to Beijing Municipality and the provinces of Sichuan (Chengdu), Guangdong (Guangzhou, Shenzhen) and Hubei (Wuhan). The field visits included community centers and health clinics, country/district hospitals, COVID-19 designated hospitals, transportations hubs (air, rail, road), a wet market, pharmaceutical and personal protective equipment (PPE) stocks warehouses, research institutions, provincial health commissions, and local Centers for Disease Control (provincial and prefecture). During these visits, the team had detailed discussion and consultations with Provincial Governors, municipal Mayors, their emergency operations teams, senior scientists, frontline clinical, public health and community workers, and community neighbourhood administrators. The Joint Mission concluded with working sessions to consolidate findings, generate conclusions and propose suggested actions.**Routes of transmission**>COVID-19 is *transmitted via droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact between an infector and infectee*. *Airborne spread has not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence*; however, it can be envisaged if certain aerosol-generating procedures are conducted in health care facilities. Fecal shedding has been demonstrated from some patients, and viable virus has been identified in a limited number of case reports. However, the fecal-oral route does not appear to be a driver of COVID-19 transmission; its role and significance for COVID-19 remains to be determined. Viral shedding is discussed in the Technical Findings (Annex C).    **Zoonotic origins**  >COVID-19 is a *zoonotic* virus. From phylogenetics analyses undertaken with available full genome sequences, bats appear to be the reservoir of COVID-19 virus, but the intermediate host(s) has not yet been identified. However, three important areas of work are already underway in China to inform our understanding of the zoonotic origin of this outbreak. These include early investigations of cases with symptom onset in Wuhan throughout December 2019, environmental sampling from the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market and other area markets, and the collection of detailed records on the source and type of wildlife species sold at the Huanan market and the destination of those animals after the marketwas closed.**Household transmission**>In China, human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus is largely occurring in families. The Joint Mission received detailed information from the investigation of clusters and some household transmission studies, which are ongoing in a number of Provinces. Among 344 clusters involving 1308 cases (out of a total 1836 cases reported) in Guangdong Province and Sichuan Province, most clusters (78%-85%) have occurred in families. Household transmission studies are currently underway, but preliminary studies ongoing in Guangdong estimate the secondary attack rate in households ranges from 3-10%.    **Children**  >Data on individuals aged 18 years old and under suggest that there is a relatively low attack rate in this age group (2.4% of all reported cases). Within Wuhan, among testing of ILI samples, no children were positive in November and December of 2019 and in the first two weeks of January 2020. From available data, and in the absence of results from serologic studies, it is not possible to determine the extent of infection among children, what role children play in transmission, whether children are less susceptible or if they present differently clinically (i.e. generally milder presentations). The Joint Mission learned that infected children have largely been identified through contact tracing in households of adults. Of note, people interviewed by the Joint Mission Team could not recall episodes in which transmission occurred from a child to an adult.  **For the public**    * 1. Recognize that COVID-19 is a new and concerning disease, but that outbreaks can managed with the right response and that the vast majority of infected people will recover;* 2. Begin now to adopt and rigorously practice the most important preventive measures for COVID-19 by frequent hand washing and always covering your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing;* 3. Continually update yourself on COVID-19 and its signs and symptoms (i.e. fever and dry cough), because the strategies and response activities will constantly improve as new information on this disease is accumulating every day; and* 4. Be prepared to actively support a response to COVID-19 in a variety of ways, including the adoption of more stringent ‘social distancing’ practices and helping the high-risk elderly population.",The World Health Organization has released the report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus.,2020-02-28 08:16:21,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fax2v0/the_world_health_organization_has_released_the/

The government is trying to censor the internet like crazy but there are just so many netizens active on Weibo (China's twitter) that will call the government out for their wrong doing or incompetence. For example, China recently proposes to legislate on how foreigners may obtain permanent residency in China, which has been very difficult historically and the ultra-nationalists (China's MAGAs) have been flooding Weibo with their dissent.

fj1t3ec,-0.7457,0.0," In the first months of the 1957 Asian flu pandemic, the virus spread throughout China and surrounding regions. By midsummer it had reached the United States, where it appears to have initially infected relatively few people. Several months later, however, numerous cases of infection were reported, especially in young children, the elderly, and pregnant women. This upsurge in cases was the result of a second pandemic wave of illness that struck the Northern Hemisphere in November 1957. At that time the pandemic was also already widespread in the United Kingdom. By December a total of some 3,550 deaths had been reported in England and Wales. The second wave was particularly devastating, and by March 1958 an estimated 69,800 deaths had occurred in the United States.  The Asian flu outbreak caused an estimated one million to two million deaths worldwide.

It's pretty despicable, regardless of which side they are on.  Any politicians still playing that game at this point should not only not be reelected, but should be charged with negligence at this point.For anyone who thinks this is just a plan by China to ruin the US economy (yes, people are that stupid) or that it's not a big deal, consider that China basically risked destroying their own economy and have probably ceded some of their dominance because of this.  If they did this on purpose it would be the dumbest plan I've ever heard of.  Also, IOC is considering cancelling the Olympics.  Do you understand how much money that represents?  That is a MASSIVE amount of loss.  Countries are pulling all the stops to handle this.  The last thing we need is a politician telling people it's no big deal.  It's a VERY big deal.  It isn't the end of humanity or even society but people WILL DIE.  Right now the best thing our leaders can do is remain calm, inform people to remain calm and to reiterate that they need to take basic measures to ensure they don't help spread it.  Panic is useless and counterproductive.  People need to be told what actions must be taken and how to take them.Plans need to be put in place to deal with a large influx of patients.  Temporary hospitals and quarantine centers need to be set up, even if they don't have every piece of equipment.  The majority of people who get sick will live but there will still be a lot of people who are going to need help and who will need to be kept separate.  We aren't going to have enough medical care for everyone but it's not going to stop them from seeking help.  We will have to do what we can.Also, the comments on the vaccine were absolutely disgusting and very short-sighted.  This isn't just about the US anymore.

fj1b6tq,-0.9583,0.0,"There are a couple factors here. But first, it's worth noting an obvious issue with the current numbers: the government isn't aggressively testing for the virus. Unless you came into the country from an infected area or start displaying the more serious symptoms (which only manifest in about 15% of cases), chances are nobody's gonna test you.So there could be thousands of infections right now, and we'll have absolutely no idea until symptoms manifest. Which could take weeks to happen.**But...** as a counterpoint to that, it's been a good three months since the outbreak started, and we're only *just now* starting to see people get sick on American soil. Even without testing, that's a pretty solid indicator that the spread of the virus really is pretty limited here, even without hard data to confirm it. The lack of severe cases so far implies a lack of cases overall, at least until very recently.So what's keeping it at bay? I do have a few ideas about this.First, America was already braced for flu season when the virus started. The flu was particularly nasty this year; it really beat the crap out of a lot of people I know, and that made everyone in my social circle a bit paranoid. Many of us are already washing our hands frequently, less likely to go outside, etc. If enough people reacted the same way, that's probably slowing the virus down a tad.Second, drugs may also be playing a part here. Thanks to the flu, pharmacies are fully stocked with cheap cold medicine. Now, don't misunderstand me; that stuff can't kill the coronavirus or make it any less infectious. But it *does* alleviate the common symptoms, and lessens the impact it has on our daily lives. That may be why we've seen so few severe cases, even though the virus is clearly in circulation. The relevant medicine is freely available, and people are already taking it.Lastly, America just has far fewer vectors for the virus to spread. Outside of cities, population density is pretty low, making it less likely that we walk by an infected person on the street. Most of the country lacks widespread public transportation, limiting a virus's ability to infect large numbers of people at once. The prevalence of social media has made physical meetups between friends less common, screwing the virus out of even more potential hosts.I also think an underrated factor here is the fact that we have a very antisocial culture in general. I'm not sure how it is in the rest of the country, but here in New England, we're very averse to physical contact unless it's with close friends or family members. The more physical distance between us, the more difficult it is for a virus to spread within our social circle. And we New Englanders are a very cold people.Will all of this stop the coronavirus? Not a chance. But if we're lucky, it should make for a slower, more gradual burn through the population, with a lower kill rate overall.",Why is the Coronavirus not spreading more in the US?,2020-02-28 10:16:15,/r/Coronavirus/comments/faz032/why_is_the_coronavirus_not_spreading_more_in_the/

fj1caro,-0.1053,-0.4767,"THE FIRST CORONAVIRUS DRUG SHORTAGE — The FDA said late Thursday that it has identified the first known drug shortage caused by the coronavirus outbreak in China.The manufacturer had recently notified the agency of its shortage but it just became clear that it was related to disruptions in the production of its active ingredient in China, Commissioner Stephen Hahn said. He added the agency is working with companies to mitigate the shortage.FDA did not identify the medicine, but it updates its drug shortage list daily. New additions over the past few days included antibacterial infusion Avycaz and Mylan-made beta-blocker Pindolol, for which stock is low because of shortage of an active ingredient.FDA also shed light on possible challenges for device supplies. It announced that is knows of 63 manufacturers that utilize 72 factories in China to make ""essential"" medical devices — including many with worker shortages due to the coronavirus. No such devices are reported to be in short supply, but device makers aren't legally required to disclose if circumstances exist that could lead to shortages.Widespread shortages of personal protective equipment like masks, gloves or surgical gowns are not being reported, but FDA said it is aware of reports that health care providers are increasing orders of the protective devices to prepare for a potential severe U.S. outbreak. Some related supply challenges for certain devices have been reported to the agency.LIMITED CORONAVIRUS TESTING CAPACITY THREATENS U.S. RESPONSE — Federal officials are also scrambling to avert a public health crisis and reduce the odds of a full-fledged coronavirus outbreak.CDC announced the first potential case of community spread in Northern California on Wednesday night, shortly after President Donald Trump addressed the nation on the outbreak. A hospital memo revealed that stringent federal rules prevented testing of the patient for a full week, despite multiple requests by doctors.Public health laboratories have faced widespread challenges verifying CDC’s emergency diagnostic, and only a handful are actively testing for the virus. The agency’s Atlanta headquarters is only able to test 350 to 500 samples a day, according to agency Director Robert Redfield.The CDC chief said that other countries have been able to expand screening faster than the United States, blaming the delay on federal regulations that govern tests developed in-house by hospitals and laboratories. Redfield also said that FDA has been supportive of efforts to boost testing, POLITICO’s Brianna Ehley reports.The Association of Public Health Laboratories told POLITICO that even if all public health labs were able to test for the virus using the CDC diagnostic, they would only be able to analyze about 100 tests per day. That raises questions about whether the United States would be able to screen enough suspected cases in a large outbreak.“We haven’t looked widely enough to believe that it is not here outside the known cases,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “China tested 320,000 people in Guangdong over a three-week period. This is the scale we need to be thinking on,” he added.CDC EXPANDS TESTING CRITERIA — Redfield told lawmakers Thursday that doctors nationwide will now be allowed to screen anyone they suspect is infected with coronavirus.Earlier CDC criteria limited testing to people experiencing symptoms who had traveled from affected countries or had been in contact with someone known to have the virus.MORE CAPACITY ON THE WAY? — HHS Secretary Alex Azar told lawmakers Thursday at least 40 labs should now be able to test for coronavirus after FDA authorized a modified version of CDC’s diagnostic.But APHL senior director of public policy Peter Kyriacopoulos said it will likely take days for those labs to get testing up and running.“They are now working through the process of making certain that the science works in each of their operations, which is exactly what you want to do,” Kyriacopoulos said.FDA appears open to allowing labs to use a shared laboratory developed test under a standard protocol, according to a letter Commissioner Stephen Hahn sent to APHL.The public health labs still must submit the test to FDA for review, according to the agency — which says the law requires it to evaluate such tests in emergency situations.“FDA has developed a template to streamline the process to facilitate the protocol that you propose while ensuring FDA’s appropriate oversight,” Hahn wrote in the letter.Diagnostic maker Qiagen confirmed to POLITICO that it plans to ask FDA to grant an emergency use authorization for its coronavirus diagnostic by Monday at the latest.AZAR: WE CAN’T CONTROL A CORONAVIRUS VAX’S COST, BUT WE’ll TRY — HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a congressional hearing this week that the government can’t promise an affordable coronavirus vaccine when one eventually launches (which NIAID’s Anthony Fauci says is still at least a year away).“We would want to ensure that we work to make it affordable, but we can’t control that price because we need the private sector to invest,” Azar told the House Energy and Commerce committee Wednesday. The secretary softened his approach in a Ways and Means hearing the next day, telling lawmakers that the administration would “work to ensure that there are appropriate protections” to make federally funded vaccines — like the Moderna product with NIH, or the BARDA-funded Johnson & Johnson candidate — affordable.Drug pricing advocates and Democrats remain unimpressed. Any potential coronavirus vaccine ""should be available to everyone, not dependent on 'Big Pharma,’” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a press conference Thursday.The U.S. government is driving coronavirus vaccine research, Public Citizen president Robert Weissman pointed out in a statement that called for the government to commit to nonexclusive licensing of whatever vaccine is developed.It’s “not just a matter of justice and avoiding profiteering, it’s a matter of public health urgency,” said Weissman. “If the vaccine is not made affordable around the world, then it won’t work to stop what could turn into a global pandemic.”INDUSTRY: WE’RE DONATING COMPOUNDS, SUPPLIES IN CORONAVIRUS FIGHT — Drugmakers have donated compounds with the potential to treat coronavirus for emergency use and research, along with much-needed medical supplies, drug industry lobby PhRMA said this week. Several companies are also at work on vaccines or treatments, including Moderna, J&J and Gilead.PhRMA also said that its members are working hard to prevent or mitigate potential drug shortages, and have partnered with both U.S. and Chinese health agencies to focus on research that could speed up development of coronavirus therapies.",FDA identifies the first coronavirus-linked drug shortage plus new details on device risks,2020-02-28 11:02:11,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fazpww/fda_identifies_the_first_coronaviruslinked_drug/

fj1kd8p,-0.8398,0.0,"This is a table comparing the common symptoms and findings on imaging (x-ray, CT etc)  of MERS and SARS  (two previous coronaviruses that can cause severe respiratory symptoms) with the current disease COVID-19 . &#x200B;Not sure exactly what you want explained but I thought it might be helpful to some people to translate some of the more jargon-y medical terms: **Dyspnea:** shortness of breath or difficulty breathing**Malaise:** general feeling of illness/discomfort (pretty vague) **Myalgia**: muscle pain/muscle aches**Arthralgia**: joint pain**On imaging**: a common finding among all three viruses is ""peripheral multifocal airspace opacities,"" meaning multiple areas in the lungs that appear lighter-colored than they should be on imaging, which indicates that there is something denser than air (generally fluid, pus, blood, etc) in the lungs. There are some differences between SARS, MERS and COVID-19 in the patterns seen between the three viruses on follow-up imaging. A rarer complication of all three is **pneumothorax** meaning air in the thoracic cavity (chest area) outside of the lungs. This can occur due to lung disease that is severe enough to cause your lung to collapse; it can also be caused by mechanical ventilation or trauma to the chest wall (like a car accident), among other things. Air trapping means that there is air in the lungs that remains trapped abnormally in the lungs even during exhale (for example due to obstruction of an airway). Fibrosis is a long-term lung complication seen commonly in MERS and rarely in SARS (we don't yet know how prevalent it is with COVID-19). Fibrosis basically means the damaged lung tissue becomes thickened and scarred, which makes it less elastic/compliant and more stiff. &#x200B;Hope this helps! :)",Diagnostic Imaging for COVID-19 - Comparison of Clinical and Radiologic Features,2020-02-28 11:39:50,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fb0aqr/diagnostic_imaging_for_covid19_comparison_of/

He visited the hospital two more times asking to be tested, the last time to the emergency department as he was having trouble breathing. **36 hours after the last visit, he was finally tested and found positive!!** In the meantime, he had **definitely** infected eighteen other people (including his pregnant wife) and possibly more. Those infected went on to infect more which is how it spread in Lombardy and to many other places.It's not so much that countries aren't properly prepared to handle viral cases but that some doctors in countries with only sporadic or no known infections don't believe someone could be potentially infected. They've dropped the ball. It's only when the (possibly) few initial cases have multiplied that a country will then struggle to contain the spread.I know test kits can be expensive (and if the poor patient doesn't have to pay).

fj233qt,-0.9855,0.0834,"I addressed this in a similar thread, but I'll go over it again here.  First, let me ask a question:  does anybody here have experience in crisis management, or has anyone heard of the ICS (Incident Command System) or NIMS (National Incident Management System)?  These are standardized, universally-taught Command-and-Control management templates that are used in disasters and critical incidents in the United States.  First-responders, fire departments, military units, and disaster-response agencies at all levels (local, state, and Federal) use a standard template to establish and delegate responsibilities, assign tasks, and maintain chain-of-command in crisis incidents.   Everybody learns this, and it makes inter-agency operation MUCH easier, because everybody is operating off the same organizational chart.  One of the principles of ICS/NIMS is Unity of Command, and the assigning of responsibilities to specific people/groups.   One of these responsibilities is dealing with the media, and fielding queries from news agencies.  There is a specific Public Affairs Officer (or section) whose ENTIRE JOB is making sure that consistent, reliable, vetted/verified information goes out to the public.  Consistent messaging is critically important in ANY crisis, and especially for incidents where there is a possibility for a public panic.   Coronavirus is a perfect example of just such an incident.   Pence and the Government are doing exactly what they SHOULD be doing in an incident like this.   Consistent messaging cuts down on the noise, lessens the number of conflicting reports, stops inter-agency pissing contests, and generally gets everybody singing off the same sheet-of-music.   This is a good thing.  I highly doubt they're covering anything up.  Even if they wanted to, nobody in DC can keep their mouth shut for more than five minutes.

fj1ssgx,-0.0772,0.0,">So what does Warren Buffet, the third richest man in the world recommend?>Markets have fallen heavily because of the inevitable economic shutdown caused by the virus, it will return to normalcy once the virus is stabilized, this is a temporary shock – so hold your investments and don’t panic. What’s more, markets are even lower than usual, which is a great time to invest some amount of money.Terrible advice. Stock markets are already tanking before most of the impacts to the physical economy have kicked in. Supply chain disruptions arising from China's restrictions are *just* starting to seriously impact manufacturing outside of China. Consumer spending in the US and EU will plummet as more confirmed cases come out. Japan and South Korea are getting hit hard. We still have a loooooonnngggggg way to go down.Also keep in mind Buffet has a clear personal interesting in keeping the US stock market from going down more.",How a Virus Outbreak Affects the Global Economy,2020-02-28 13:20:18,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fb1u6e/how_a_virus_outbreak_affects_the_global_economy/

fj1ymgq,-0.9669,0.0,"It depends. You have to ask yourself if you are a speculator or an investor.If you are a speculator, sell, sell, sell. Speculators try to figure out where stocks are headed over the short-term by looking at a past price performance and then trying to predict the behaviour of the most irrational and emotional traders and make an investment choice based on that. I can't speak about how much money you'll make, but there are only a handful of successful speculators, the rest are playing catch-up. Waiting for things to settle down and then buy (usually high), but when do things ever settle down? The market doesn't ring a bell signalling that it's all clear. Okay, you can be a speculator and sell and use emotion of other people and your own to guide your decisions.Number 2. You can be an investor. This is a totally different animal, investors focus on the long term, you aren't just buying something that goes up and down on a chart, you are buying a piece of a company. Buffett will be turning 90 this August, the guy has been investing since he was 11. Ask yourself, has the 10 to 20 year outlook for American business changed in the last 24 to 48 horas? Not really. Headlines are always scary, that's how the media make money. So buy when stocks are cheap, avoid them when they are expensive, pretty sage advice. So, if you sell during times of panic you are selling it in a lower price guided by fear. You should be buying when things are cheap with extreme confidence.The financial crisis of 2008 was an emotional time, with the market falling as much as 50% and taking a year and a half to start to settle down and grow again. Most sold during the panic and never came back in, they missed a 300-400% rise over the next decade, which turned out to be the longest bull market in history, because they let fear make the decision for them. Don't let it do this for you, whatever might be the shock affecting the economy.Buy when stocks are cheap and sell when they are expensive. Doesn't get more simpler than that. You'll be doing extremely well over the next five years, while others will be playing catchup.",How a Virus Outbreak Affects the Global Economy,2020-02-28 13:20:18,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fb1u6e/how_a_virus_outbreak_affects_the_global_economy/

fj1wvdp,-0.6934,0.0,"Great read. Full text for anyone paywalled>Iran’s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, was pale and drenched in sweat during a press conference on Monday as he told reporters that the Islamic Republic had “almost stabilized” the country’s outbreak of coronavirus. He mopped his brow so often that an aide scurried to the lectern with a box of tissues. Harirchi dismissed as hype an Iranian lawmaker’s claim that fifty people had already died from COVID-19. “I will resign if the numbers are even half or a quarter of this,” he said, adding that Iran had only sixty-one confirmed cases, with twelve deaths. Iran opposed quarantines, he said, because they belonged to an era before the First World War—“to the plague, cholera, stuff like that.” The next day, Harirchi confirmed in a video—from quarantine—that he had contracted coronavirus.>Iran, a country of eighty-three million people, has now become one of the global epicenters of the coronavirus—with the highest mortality rate in the world. Based on official numbers, the mortality rate in Iran has fluctuated daily, between eight and eighteen per cent, compared to three per cent in China and less everywhere else. Iran is also unique, because a disproportionate number of confirmed cases are senior government officials. On Thursday, the Vice-President, Masoumeh Ebtekar—who gained fame in 1979 as Sister Mary, the spokeswoman for the students who seized the U.S. Embassy and took fifty-two Americans hostage—announced that she, too, had contracted the coronavirus. The day before, she had attended a meeting with President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet. Two members of parliament, including the chairman of the Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy, have also been infected, as has the mayor of a district in Tehran and a senior cleric who had served as Iran’s Ambassador to the Vatican. One of the lawmakers, Mahmoud Sadeghi, tweeted on Tuesday, “I send this message in a situation where I have little hope of surviving in this world.” The former Vatican Ambassador, who was eighty-one, died on Thursday. So did Elham Sheikhi, a member of the women’s national soccer team, who was twenty-two.> Iran’s official counts—three hundred and eighty-eight confirmed cases and thirty-four deaths, as of Friday—may be grossly underreported. In an early analysis published on Monday, six Canadian epidemiologists calculated that Iran probably had more than eighteen thousand cases of coronavirus. Their mathematical model was based on Iran’s official death toll, the disease’s infection and mortality rates worldwide, inflections in other countries traced to Iran, flight data, and travel patterns. “Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size,” they concluded. Because of the wide margin of error, the number of cases could range from as low as thirty-seven hundred to as high as fifty-three thousand. In the end, the Canadian epidemiologists settled on eighteen thousand three hundred, with a ninety-five-per-cent confidence rate. All of their estimates are many, many times higher than the figures that Iran has reported. Their model was published on medRxiv, which posts preliminary research that has not yet been peer-reviewed. >Kamiar Alaei, a widely recognized Iranian global health-policy expert who co-founded an innovative H.I.V. clinic in Tehran, also emphasized the tricky and still evolving mathematics of coronavirus contagion. “The mortality rate elsewhere is around one to two per cent, and three per cent in China,” Alaei, who is now a co-president of the Institute for International Health and Education, in Albany, told me. “Iran has announced thirty-four deaths, although some unofficial reports claim it is at least a hundred and thirty-four and even two hundred. So if the death rate is only one per cent, then the total number of cases would be between thirty-four hundred and ten thousand or even twenty thousand.”>The outbreak appears to have started in Qom, the conservative city of Shiite seminaries run by leading ayatollahs, about two hours from Tehran. It is also home to the Fatima Masumeh shrine—famed for its giant gold dome and intricate blue tilework—which draws pilgrims from all over the world. (For its historic beauty, I visit the shrine complex whenever I go to Qom.) The first mention of the disease by the government was a report of two deaths in the city on February 19th. Initial reports indicate that the carrier of the virus may have been a merchant who travelled between Qom and Wuhan, in China, where COVID-19 is believed to have originated. The outbreak is estimated to have begun between three and six weeks ago, which would mean that the two Iranians who died could have been sick and infecting others for weeks.>Within eight days of the first reported death in Iran, COVID-19 had spread to twenty-four of the country’s thirty-one provinces. The number of cases has roughly doubled daily since Tuesday. Instead of closing down public sites, a measure that public-health experts have taken in other countries, the head of the shrine in Qom called on pilgrims to keep coming. “We consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing. That means people should come here to heal from spiritual and physical diseases,” Mohammad Saeedi, who is also the representative of Iran’s Supreme Leader in Qom, said in a video. Cases traced back to Iran have been reported in Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Canada, Georgia, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. Many of these cases have been linked specifically to visits to Qom.Continued below",How Iran Became a New Epicenter of the Coronavirus Outbreak,2020-02-28 14:34:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fb2w2x/how_iran_became_a_new_epicenter_of_the/

The outbreak coincided with two major milestones—the anniversary of Iran’s revolution, on February 11th, and the parliamentary election, on February 21st. “The government didn’t want to acknowledge that they had a coronavirus outbreak because they feared it would impact participation in these two events,” he said. “So for weeks there was a huge silence.” Less than forty-three per cent of Iranian voters turned out for the election, the lowest rate of participation since the 1979 revolution. Both voters and poll workers were photographed wearing masks.>“It was the political decision that led to this outbreak in Iran,” Alaei said. “It’s very unfortunate, as Iran has a very well-established infrastructure for the health system and well-educated doctors.” Alaei was imprisoned in 2008 for “communicating with the enemy,” running espionage rings, and trying to “launch a velvet revolution” against the government in Tehran. He spent thirty months in the notorious Evin Prison. He moved to the United States after his release.The coronavirus is also becoming a new flashpoint between Iran and the United States. After the election, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused Iran’s enemies of exaggerating the threat of coronavirus to scare voters away from the polls. “This negative propaganda about the virus began a couple of months ago and grew larger ahead of the election,” he said. “Their media did not miss the tiniest opportunity for dissuading Iranian voters and resorting to the excuse of disease and the virus.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, countered that Iran was lying about “vital details” of the spread of the virus.>The timing of the epidemic is particularly dire for Iran’s economy. As part of President Trump’s “maximum-pressure campaign,” the U.S. reimposed economic sanctions on Iran—and any foreign company or country that does business with it—in November, 2018. Iran’s economy contracted more than nine per cent last year. Since the coronavirus outbreak began, ten days ago, eleven countries, including major trading partners such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey, have closed their borders to the Islamic Republic, according to Adnan Mazarei, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington. “The entire Middle East region could soon be affected by Iran’s role as an epicenter of this contagion,”he wrote on Thursday. “The Middle East region will certainly be hit by a new round of downward pressure on oil prices on account of a decline in demand for oil by China and elsewhere,” he added. And China has accounted for a quarter of all Iranian trade.>Internal commerce is also likely to take a hit on the eve of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, in three weeks. Nowruz is the country’s biggest holiday, and the ritual is to buy new clothes and toys—and to travel to the Caspian coast or other vacation spots to take a break from Iran’s mounting crises. The more that Nowruz celebrations are curtailed, the greater the danger for protests about the epidemic, global isolation, and unanticipated economic setbacks. Two waves of protests have challenged the regime since November.>Iran took steps this week to check the contagion’s spread. In Tehran’s subways, cars were disinfected and snack shops were shut. In more than a dozen provinces, public venues—college campuses, schools, and cultural centers—were closed. Events drawing large audiences, including soccer games and movie screenings, were postponed. Friday prayers were cancelled in the twenty-four provinces where the virus has appeared. Schools across Iran will be closed for three days, as of Saturday. The Health Ministry has urged people not to shake hands and to avoid crowded places. Social media was filled with parodies—a video of young men on the street shaking their shoes with one another, to avoid shaking hands, and a barber cutting the hair of a customer, who was wearing a mask, with a razor attached to an extender pole. Yet the regime has been fighting the image of a nation crippled by an epidemic as much as it has been fighting the coronavirus itself. Speaking at a national headquarters established to deal with the virus, Rouhani said, “In schools, high schools, universities, and workplaces, everybody should pay attention to health recommendations. But we must all continue our work and activities, because it is one of the enemies’ plots to spread fear in our country and close down the country.”>The ailing deputy health minister was more candid. “I’m saying this deep from my heart . . . take care of yourselves,” Harirchi said in avideo that he posted from quarantine. “This is a democratic virus, and it doesn’t distinguish between poor and rich, statesman and an ordinary citizen. It may infect a number of people.” In the Islamic Republic, that number may be frighteningly large.",How Iran Became a New Epicenter of the Coronavirus Outbreak,2020-02-28 14:34:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fb2w2x/how_iran_became_a_new_epicenter_of_the/

Hundreds of thirsty, beer-lacking students took part in the multi-wipe challenge.   Results were video-recorded, anal-ized, and entered into an SPSS database.A machine vision system examined the used butt papers doing pattern recognition with AI homing in on  more successful efforts at multi-wiping.  The students were incredibly resourceful, flexible, and creative.   A panel of impartial judges assured that no efforts that resulted in skid marks on undergarments, or along the buttocks resulted from subsequent wipes.  (Up to 5, by one Chinese student). I'm happy to announce the results are successful  and will be doing so live on Youtube with an actual demonstration, tonight, 9pm EST.

fj25yby,0.8349,0.0,"Answers:There is no perceived water-borne risk at this time.  Coronavirus has decent susceptibility to chlorine in the water, and feces excretion is atypical as diarrhea is not a usual symptom.  There was a report out of Hong Kong, but it was from SARS and became airborne.  This shouldn't be an issue in a normal apartment.Air conditioners are more of a risk for bacteria.  You may wish to get a higher grade filter for your air handler though, but make sure your system can handle it.Does air come in under the door to your apartment?  Like, do you feel a draft pushing in?  If so, you may wish to consider putting something along the bottom to provide a better seal.  While lower risk, someone coughing in the hallway could theoretically allow the virus to be sucked in.  Again, it is more likely to put some viruses on your floor, so washing your hands after handling things around the floor and not touching your face is most important.The odds of someone coughing on another floor and enough of the virus to hit you through an open window is extremely low.  Your air has to come from somewhere, and outside is safest.  If you have a roommate who gets sick, open windows will actually reduce the odds of infection.  Also, let the sun shine in.Your bathroom fan pulls air, it doesn't push.  It pulls from wherever it flows easiest.  Maybe from the hallway.  Maybe from outside.  You need to determine that.

Also, the CDC sent the original test kits to the wrong state. They later reported the contents were damaged, ultimately delaying testing of the 60+ cases and people that are already in quarantine. The state was trying to get samples from Japan but the approval would go through the CDC. Also shipping samples to Atlanta, getting results back, also takes time.Not to mention, no screening from Asia. A local coming on from Asia reported she was surprised not even questioning. As you can see it’s the lack of trust that things are being handled appropriately. Hawaii is huge with tourist from Asia, on most islands. I feel for my Ohana at home, you all please take care!

Multiple users confirmed that other search engines  DuckDuckGo and Qwant were showing r/Coronavirus at the top of search results for “r/Coronavirus,” in contrast with the results of the same search at Google, in which the results were more difficult to locate. The subreddit has rapidly grown recently to over ninety thousand users and receives over a million page views per day, according to a moderator.One user, who claimed to be a postdoc at Harvard, said that they had encountered evidence that even his relatively moderate posts about the possibility of undetected cases were being censored on Facebook. The alleged postdoc goes on to state that it may be Facebook is “trying to prevent public panic.” A Redditor pointed out that The World Health Organization has a working partnership with media companies including Facebook and Google to control the spread of misinformation. Another user ominously finished their comment by saying “While I don't support censorship I am grateful for the 'normal' world outside my window.

He told my husband there was no testing unless symptoms started 14 days after and it had been 21. And he said they had no way to test anyway. My friend, who is a pediatrician, posted an Instagram story today about how she had been to Hawaii last week. There was a known case in Hawaii a week before they were there. My pediatrician friend said that when they arrived home, her husband spiked a high fever and started coughing up blood. They went to the ER and they told them all of this but they did not test for corona. After neg flu they treated him for pneumonia and sent him home.

No real point in calling it presumptive in my opinion other than trying to make things sound better #Wuhan #SuspectedEdit #5: No known travel, spent time at a school district!Edit #6: Don't know number of close contacts, don't know where they got COVID-19, contact tracing is top priority.Edit #7: Testing another individual, don't think they said if it was relatedEdit #8: My personal opinion is that the tone of this briefing coupled with the fact that the person spent time in an elementary school and that they don't know how many contacts the person had makes this really scary.Edit #9: Wash your hands and don't touch your face. Little bit of a lol from me since if you're reading this you certainly know that.Edit #10: Washington County, Forest Hills Elementary School (I believe) are the specifics, if that's important to anyone in the area. Can't comment on condition. Patient is still hospitalized.Edit #11: Sounds like that school is in Clackamas (sp?) county? Sorry if I'm messing that up.Edit #12: Team giving briefing learned of this case at 3pm (assuming that's Pacific time)Edit #13: Question is whether this is a community transmission event, answer is that the patient is presumed to be a community-acquired case, i.e., must have acquired it from someone else. Follow-up question: should we assume someone else has the virus? Answer: that's why we're tracing contacts. Follow-up: So we'll see an increase in numbers? Answer: Yes, that's possible and case count may very well tick up.Edit #14: Clarification that people with serious respiratory illness but no travel history can now be tested according to new CDC guidance. Question re: closing schools / quarantines. Answer: That's why we're working through the weekend to try to find contacts, might have to consider those measures depending on what we find. Question: How quickly will you notify public of new cases? Answer: when we know, you will know.Edit #15: Are there any concerns elsewhere in Washington County (maybe person lives in different county than where the school is?) Answer: working on finding contacts on a minute-by-minute basis of patient's daily activities, focusing on prolonged close contacts.Other individual being tested is not connected to this person (I'm 95% sure that's what they just said)Edit #16: You say this is low risk and people should go about their lives?

She took care of a patient within the last week: late 40's, otherwise healthy, but severe pneumonia. Chinese descent, and while they weren't recently in China, it's possible a family member may have been. Is it actually COVID-19? They don't know because they didn't have a test for it. I don't know how the CDC is testing for it but at least at my mom's hospital, it's not a readily available test. How do we know how widespread it is if testing isn't readily available?Edit: I would entertain the possibility that the physicians did not believe the patient to be at risk and so didn't order a test, but that would just prove my point in that if we aren't testing for a virus that causes disease that often looks like a run-of-the-mill respiratory virus, how do we know it's not already spreading (until we get a really sick patient)?","The new case in Oregon is employed at a school and ""may have exposed students and staff there""",2020-02-28 18:49:53,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fb63lc/the_new_case_in_oregon_is_employed_at_a_school/

fj2nnrg,-0.9595,0.0,"  I go to Texas A&M (reputable school) and study virology. Our professor went on a long rant showing us the exponential growth of this outbreak of disease (virus) and its quite intimidating to be honest. I mean there's been days in China where the infections went up 256% (verified) that's incredible in terms of viruses and is most definitely more severe than the flu. When compared to something like Ebola which is hard to do since they're two completely different things the alarm bells ring for anyone that has studied virology/biology/communicable diseases. I think the death in China had to have been suppressed as the death rate in Iran is between 8-18% (verified) and possibly much higher given the circumstances surrounding the BBC's reporting today that 250 have died (not verified). Italy is also guilty of suppressing info at this time (verified). Assuming you are in the United States as I am we are most definitely on a virus fast track to an outbreak (2 cases in California of unknown origin, 1 case of unknown origin in Oregon, and POSSIBLY! 1 case in Washington state) (Verified).

My science background is NOT medical and I will happily defer to a better interpretation, but this was my takeaway.&#x200B;AbstractBackground: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has  been widely spread. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic  and allergy status of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.Methods:  Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical  manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological  materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result  of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed.Results: An  approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was  found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were  community-acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%),  and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical  manifestations, whereas hyper-tension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus  (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity  (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients.  Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the  patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients  and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy  opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding.  Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most  patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lympho-cyte  counts in severe (r  =  .486, P <  .001) and nonsevere (r  =  .469, P   <  .001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher  levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated  with severe patients compared to nonsevere pa-tients (all P <  .001).Conclusion: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized  COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a  potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD  are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of  comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were  associated with severe patients.Edits:  changed personal opinion & summary comment to summary (still personal interpretation) and a copy of the abstract.

fj2szhp,-0.6488,0.0772,"Some extracts for those that don’t get through long articlesIt was the next day, on Thursday morning, that the chief medical officers of all the states, with their Commonwealth counterpart, Brendan Murphy, advised the government unanimously that a global pandemic was already under way. They had observed the accelerating spread of notified cases around the world, the growing number of countries affected, and that the outbreaks were now self-sustaining within some communities far from China.They hadn't been alarmist. Forty-two countries reported they had confirmed infections on Thursday. By the time the Australian government's daily 6.30am incident report was delivered on Friday, that number had grown to 49.Australia's group of state and federal medical officers, convening daily, usually by phone hook-up, is the peak point of the pure medical advice, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC). No politicians sit in on their meetings.From there, the medical advice goes to the policymakers in the National Security Committee of the federal cabinet, and this is where the politicians get involved. The NSC is chaired by the Prime Minister. This is where decisions are made and action taken. Or not.The medical officers' ""pandemic"" call was a big moment. For a start, they were way ahead of the UN body that is supposedly the lead gloybal agency on international health emergencies, the Geneva-based World Health OrganisationWhy were the Australians ahead of the world? For a very simple reason. They don't trust the WHO.

fj2u4wl,0.8705,-0.5423,"I thought this was just so informative that I wanted to share it with everyone.  Please take 11 minutes and watch it.  Basically, it outlines ""how"" COVID-19 kills you.  Through inflammation of your lungs, oxygen is unable to be transmitted to your bloodstream.  This is called ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okg7uq\_HrhQ&feature=emb\_rel\_end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okg7uq_HrhQ&feature=emb_rel_end)Piles of links to papers and data if you want to read further in there.&#x200B;But, a key point here is how over the years, medicine has identified three ways to reduce the mortality rate of ARDS.  Two of them you need to be in a hospital.  The third one, however, you can do at your own home if it truly came to that:1. Ventilator to help keep the alveoli open, which consequently helps prevent ""collapse"" of them2. Inducing paralysis through medicine.  This helps you to stay ""in sync"" with the ventilator, and your body not overcome the machine.3. Laying down in the prone position.  Yes, on your stomach.  This will further reduce mortality rate. So while 1 & 2 is available only at a hospital, you technically could do #3 yourself, if you absolutely needed to in an event where hospitals are crowded and you had no other choice.To be clear, just getting COVID-19 doesn't mean you're guaranteed to get ARDS.  But, if it does come to that, the papers outline that laying in prone reduced mortality rate from 33% to 16% ""on ventilator support"".  So really, who knows if being prone while NOT on a ventilator has any effect.  Lots of big terms thrown around in here, but, nonetheless, this paper does outline that being prone ultimately leads to a greater aeration due to gravity.ARDS treatment via prone position:[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6026253/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6026253/)So, I only share this so that in the dire event you or a loved one happen to pick this virus up, and are in critical condition and your local hospitals are swamped, consider trying to force yourself prone for a long time.  Yes... it would absolutely suck.  But it's life or death right?  Just a tool to have in your toolbox.  Something to think about is all.Bless you all and stay safe.",How Coronavirus Kills.

fj2vl2t,0.9659,-0.5423,"Thanks for trying to summarize this but I have to correct something.  Lying prone on your own will do nothing. I'm not trying to be insulting but it's just playing doctor.  Prone position is a technique used in an intensive care unit and ONLY once on a ventilator.  There is absolutely no way you will have ARDS and not be intubated in the ICU (or very close to being to there).  ""Proning"" is kind of a last ditch effort.  If your lungs are damaged enough to have ARDS there's simply NO way you're still dicking around trying to lay flat at home or even in the hospital.  You're probably in a medically induced coma and it isn't your choice to make.  Leave it to the pros.  I just would hate for for someone to delay real medical care for themselves or a loved one because they are hoping that sleeping on their stomach will help.  Wash your hands, use hand sanitizer.  Keep calm and carry on.  It'll be ok.Edit:  Not to be argumentative - only for your further understanding.  The prone position therapy referenced in the paper only works on a ventilator.  When you compare the difference in a lung that is breathing spontaneously (like we are now) and one that is having air/oxygen forced into it, there are different mechanical and pressure gradients at work.  These differences and the immune response to pathology (of any etiology - ARDS being the final,catch all term for failing lungs) are why the study results about probe vs supine apply only to a ventilated lung - protected with an endotracheal tube. ( Google ""West zones of the lung"" for a basic primer in lung biomechanics)  This means that any studies on mortality in prone position are completely inapplicable to an unventilated lung.  It's apples and oranges.   Even in the event that you are in some apocalyptic scenario ( pretty unlikely with this particular virus)  laying on the couch face down may actually be more unsafe for simple reasons like aspiration of vomit or asphyxiation from bedclothes or the like. (There's no study on that scenario that's just me speculating - your guess is as good as mine)  Again, it's a scenario which is almost completely theoretical - if a loved one you're caring for got this sick in MadMax land then it would be best *maybe* to have them in the ""recovery""position.  If it's you, then  you would be so hypoxic by that time that you would not be remembering this nuance or even the meaning of the words prone vs supine!Best of luck, now I have to start modifying my car for those desert battles after Corona virus tears through!",How Coronavirus Kills.

These normally relate to people who may not have been seen for several days or aren't answering calls or visits, e.g. an elderly person who may have had a fall or some other misadventure. But police would not routinely be involved in checkups unless specifically requested.Casual contacts would not routinely be followed up on but confirmed cases, suspect cases (sometimes dependent on their symptomology) and close contacts would have daily contact which serves a couple of purposes. Daily checkups allow a welfare check (are you ok, any symptoms, everyone in family.household well), allows the to pass on any requests or info, helps double check info (people are often poor historians and often takes a few contacts to work out travel and all possible contacts, e.g. I'd forgotten last Thursday I stopped in on Aunty Shirl and had a quick cuppa before going shopping), plus checks their quarantine status. This contact is attempted throughout the day until successful.In terms of enforcement, it's generally done via Public Health Orders and is very specific, some info can be found here:https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/phact/Pages/pha-ph-orders.aspxIt's less about the penalties and more about getting public health measures done quickly, whether it's treatment, quarantine, info etc.There are also federal quarantine powers under the Quarantine Act and amendments:https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/bd/bd0304/04bd031Plus the Biosecurity Act, but these are different from the State's quarantine mechanisms and act at a more regional level, such as prevention of entry or quarantine on entry.

fj38kef,0.9376,0.0,"Just based on the virology I dont know if “dormant like anthrax” is the right way to phrase it. Anthrax is caused by a spore forming bacteria. When the bacteria become nutrient deprived or are in inhospitable conditions they form a spore. When conditions are favorable, the spore germinates into a cell again.There are viruses that can be dormant (latent) like herpesviruses which have double stranded DNA genomes and can integrate into our cells’ DNA. The same happens for retroviruses like HIV which have RNA genomes but then make double stranded DNA during replication.Coronaviruses can’t do either of these things. They are RNA viruses but they don’t have the enzyme to make double stranded DNA. There may be low levels of replication at the level of detection and the body has trouble completely clearing it, like what is thought with Ebola. Or it’s detecting fragmented RNA from the original infection, but weeks later is a long time for RNA.

fj2z2qu,0.9418,0.1779," Melbourne mum Suzanne D’Silva, husband Dellone and daughter Bianca, 21, were struck down with dreaded coronavirus as a dream cruise holiday turned into a nightmare. Only son Brenton, 14, was spared. Now 48-year-old Mrs D’Silva, who has returned to Australia with her family, describes what it is like to battle the feared virus — and finally get the all-clear  It started with a temperature and shivering.I was very weak and the shortness of breath was bad.My temperature was high, I had a bit of a sore throat but there was nothing out of the ordinary that felt any different to a normal cold or flu.My daughter Bianca had been diagnosed with coronavirus four days earlier so I knew straight away that’s what it could be.But by the time I was diagnosed I was already starting to improve. I was still weak but I wasn’t feeling particularly unwell.My husband Dellone however was getting very sick. His oxygen levels were very low, his blood pressure was very high.Guys in hazmat suits sprayed us and our bags as we got of the ship and drove us 2 ½ hours away to hospital.The whole day was a terrifying experience.&#x200B;We knew as long as we were in the hospital we couldn’t be in better place to be treated.I didn’t think we could get any more sick than what we had already been. That was our hope.My shortness of breath was quite distinctive.Especially at night I was feeling very out of breath.The doctor told me the virus had caused pneumonia patches on a lung scan.But he said the patches weren’t very big which was good and meant it was clearing. I didn’t feel very unwell so I knew at least I was on the mend.We were on antibiotics but my husband was put on an experimental HIV drugs because he had a terrible cough, low oxygen and his pneumonia was more prominent.The drug was something that they used on some people in China and that had worked.When you are really sick it really does play on your mind.You get worried when you hear the news and you see people are dying.But all the people who were ill were people who had previous health conditions.We were quite healthy so we were quite confident our bodies could fight it.But you are scared because you don’t know what you don’t know. You are just hearing off the news and you’re hoping it will be OK. Each individual person is going to have their own experience of it.It helped that we were strong enough to actually fight it.Each day you get a little bit better and you start to see symptoms go and your temperature starts to get back to normal levels. They also monitor your oxygen levels.When we got the all-clear we were waiting all day. They call it a PCR test — two tests that they have to do 12 hours apart and they both have to be negative for you to get the all-clear. The tests included a throat and nasal swab.We had the test on the Sunday then we had another test on Monday.On Tuesday all day we were waiting for the doctor.Finally the doctor came in late Tuesday night and when I saw his face, through the hazmat mask his eyes had a bit of a sparkle. I was like: ‘Oh my God’. He said: ‘Good news’. We were just over the moon.It was just such a relief. Now I’m feeling fine. Dellone is still quite weak but we are home and all-clear.Anyone who is older I really feel sorry for them.We are very thankful and grateful to all our family and friends and our doctor for all the love, care and support.",Coronavirus: Melbourne mum Suzanne D’Silva on what it’s like to be infected.

Note that Raiffeisen as a name exists in other countries but is actually not the same company. It refers to a style of community banks with independent branches. The risk is domestic here, and rather limited compared to the financial crisis.The other three banks are UBS, Credit Suisse and ZKB (Zürcher Kantonal Bank). UBS and Credit Suisse are global institutes and learned their lesson, particularly UBS which had forced state intervention during the financial crisis. The regulatory authority has increased requirements for both every year since then to ensure that will not happen again.ZKB is a bit of a special case. It sounds local and small and in some ways it is but at the same time it isn't. They run a (scaled down) infrastructure like a global bank, including some non-retail branches around the world, to offer a full range of services for the general public, businesses and government. These services are (mostly) only available for customers in the Canton of Zürich though. It is the backbone of the financial hub.It is consistently ranked among top 3 safest banks in the world with dual government insurance (Zürich and Switzerland). By the time that bank goes down most financial capitals around the world will be reduced to craters and the system will be gone.","Two of the five Swiss banks deemed to pose a risk to the financial system in a major crisis, don’t have an effective emergency plan in place.",2020-02-28 23:16:23,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fb9172/two_of_the_five_swiss_banks_deemed_to_pose_a_risk/
