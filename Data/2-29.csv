fj34uvj,-0.9592,0.5719," John and Corinne Upsher are not going to take the chance the coronavirus will leave them short of household essentials.The couple trundle out of a Flemington supermarket on Saturday morning with two shopping trolleys filled to the brim with canned vegetables, toilet paper, pasta and olive oil. Their second freezer is already chock-full of meat.A retired microbiologist, Mr Upsher said he and his wife were taking a “pragmatic view” of the potential pandemic. If Victorians are told to reduce exposure to other people, he said, the couple would now only have to leave home for the weekly fresh produce shop.Many people would regard ""preppers as paranoid but there are health experts who quietly urge people to sensibly stock up on food over the next few weeks and supermarkets report a lift in sales of non-perishable goods. “We have dried goods, preserved goods, pasta, things for the freezer… just buying a bit extra, so that if things get really bad we can avoid the shops. If it’s no more lethal than the common cold, then we’re not too worried. But if people are advised to be cautious, we’re in a position to do that,"" Mr Upsher said.“Since older people are a bit vulnerable – I’m a little over 80, she’s a little under 80 – we’re playing it safe.""Supermarkets were busier than usual late last week, while Woolworths revealed there had been a rush on non-perishable food and grocery items.""We’ve seen a sharp increase in demand for long-life pantry items and household staples in recent days, which has led to partial stock shortages across some of our stores,"" a Woolworths spokesman said.He told *The Age* there were good supplies in the distribution centres so any stock shortages would be temporary and the company was working to shore up supply chains.Online discussions are sharply polarised with many accusing those advocating preparation of ""fearmongering"". People who are building up their supplies are often too embarrassed to talk publicly and some are even trying to do it on the sly because their partner thinks it is silly.Belinda Hughes, a skincare specialist who lives in Melbourne’s CBD, said her cupboards were usually bare but the threat of a COVID-19 outbreak had changed her habits.“I was buying things I don’t normally buy. Stuff my mother used to keep in the pantry,” Ms Hughes said. “Keeping pasta sauce and pasta and rice, just making sure you have enough olive oil, just pantry staples.”Ms Hughes went through the bushfires over summer, which she said made her a bit more aware of how badly things can get in an emergency.“Supplies ran out really, really quickly,” she said.Professor Ben Cowie, an infectious disease specialist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne, said Australians needed to find middle ground between panicking and complacency.While COVID-19 was unlikely to be severe in most otherwise-healthy people, he said it was not just another type of flu.Professor Cowie said ""social isolation"" was a useful tool in a viral outbreak that involved minimising going out in public, especially to places with sick people such as doctors, pharmacies and hospitals.He said people should get vaccinated and buy personal medications and it was ""actually reasonable"" to buy extra cans of vegetables or packets of cereal as a contingency. However, he said people who cannot afford extra food should not worry.""In an advanced country like Australia with good primary health care and good health system, I don't think people need to go and fill their cellar with tins,"" Professor Cowie said.""I don’t think we’re discussing a large-scale, preparing-for-nuclear-winter type response but reducing the need to go and get routine supplies is a rational response.""Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said he didn't believe stockpiling was appropriate at this stage. ""I think we are a very well-prepared country. We know that people stockpiling masks caused an issue with mask supply and we don't support that,"" he said.Pharmacist Irene Vonghack, of Botanical Pharmacy South Yarra, said the business had sold hundreds of masks and sanitisers and she had noticed people stocking up on vitamins and immune support medication.“People have been asking questions. I try to say, ‘in Australia we are fine, as long as you handle your personal hygiene’,” she said.Russell, who lives in a share house in Caulfield North and did not wish to give his last name, shares groceries with his housemates and said they had been stockpiling canned goods, pasta and non-perishables.""Our housemate, Tom, approached us and said, 'I don't think we should panic, but I think we should take it slightly seriously,"" he said.Russell said his housemate was in remission from cancer, so had a weaker immune system. They decided to buy an extra four or five things each time they shopped.""We're not actually concerned, but we're more thinking, why not?""""I think that it’s good that people are thinking about it, being two steps ahead.""",AUSTRALIA: 'We're playing it safe': Meet the Melbournians preparing pantries for coronavirus,2020-02-29 01:07:42,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fba0l7/australia_were_playing_it_safe_meet_the/

The original report was in Chinese and I'm trying to translate t voluntarily due to its usefulness.  >  >Please consult the author through the link before transferring this article elsewhere.  >  >This article features an interview with **Gong Zuojiong (龚作炯), director of the Division of  Infectious Diseases,** [WHU Renmin Hospital](http://www.rmhospital.com/). His colleagues have just released a preprinted [paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025239v1) regarding the autopsy of 25 death cases infested with COVID-19, presenting us with >some really good insights on the possible death cause and characteristics of these patients.**Some key facts about the paper**Out of all 25 deceased cases:* 10 males, 15 females* Average age range: 71.48±12.42* Courses of the disease range from 6 to 15 days* All patients were killed by respiratory failure* All patients had underlying chronic disease：   * 16 cases w/ hypertension   * 10 cases w/ diabetes   * 8 cases w/ heart disease   * 5 cases w/ CKD   * 4 cases w/ cerebral infarction   * 2 cases w/ COPD   * 2 cases w/ malignant tumor (cancer)   * 1 case w/ acute pancreatitis* Except for lungs, damage of heart, kidney, and liver were also discovered**Onto the actual interview:**&#x200B;>DeepTech: A researched published on Medrxiv on Feb 12th stated that the fatality rate of male patients is three times the rate of female patients. Why is your result (10:15) so different?**Gong:** **The purpose of our research is to figure out what caused the patient's death and what the death characteristics are**. As of now, the research is only a retrospective study focused on a small sample over a specific period. It does not showcase the probability of a larger sample.The highlighted conclusion of our study is that all of the first 25 cases share common characteristics on both high-age and preliminary diseases, notably hypertension, then diabetes and heart disease. However, we have not done any further investigation of their living habits, such as smoking history.&#x200B;>DeepTech: Are there any differences between these deceased cases and other critically-killed patients?**Gong:** A lot of factors have a play here, including the modes of repertory support (whether invasive or not) and the time of implementation (when the support devices were utilized). Moreover, the time of diagnosis and the condition of any pre-existing diseases are also quite decisive.Out researches have indicated that certain fundamental indicators, such as Cardiac performances, coagulation function indicators, as well as CRP and SAA indicators, can all be used as references of the disease’s progress. **If a patient is delayed into a critical condition from an early stage, irreversible harm could have occurred, and the effect of respiratory support will be impacted.**&#x200B;>Deeptech: Why are some younger patients dying as well?**Gong:** That is more related to the time of diagnosis and the timing of treatments. **This is why we are talking about establishing an effective early warning/triage system. The death rate can only be lowered if we can intervene earlier and with more active approaches.**&#x200B;>Deeptech: I’ve heard people talking about the four stages of respiratory support: First, high flow oxygen therapy; if not working, then use a non-invasive ventilator, if still not effective, intubation is necessary. The last resort is using artificial lung (ECMO). Is that right?**Gong:** This is indeed a classification of respiratory supports in an orderly manner. Oxygen support at an early stage is most definitely beneficial. However, autopsies done recently have shown the existence of large amounts of secretions in the lower respiratory tract of late-stage patients. Improper positive pressure oxygenation may press viscous secretions into the alveoli, thus causing alveolar ventilation dysfunction.This is only a speculation, so these treatment mechanisms need pathological results to further confirm their effects. Similarly, the pathogenesis and potential key causes of death are yet to be revealed by further autopsies.The research of Academician Wang Fusheng on ""The Lancet · Respiratory Medicine"" on February 17 only showcased the result of puncturing examinations after the patient's death. Its conclusion is yet to be confirmed by autopsy results.&#x200B;>Deeptech: So, ECMO may not be the last option?**Gong:** Well, based on what we have learned now, using ECMO may not necessarily save one’s life. In fact, no matter whether invasive intubation or ECMO is used, the deterioration of one’s condition cannot be stopped if the supporting device cannot be removed. Therefore, it is really decided if the patient’s condition is improving under respiratory supports.&#x200B;>Deeptech: Someone described the dying NcOV patients as followed: **Breathing difficulties until the last few minutes, and the patient was awake throughout. The patient would call for help, crying and shouting, ""Doctor, save me ..."" With a violent struggle, until exhaled the last breath.****Gong:** This is possible. Although a patient cannot verbally express his feelings under invasive incubation, **a patient may remain conscious at his final time**. **The disease would ultimately lead to respiratory failure, which is indeed a painful process.**In fact, they died of suffocation. Since there was a large amount of mucus in the lungs, oxygen could not enter the alveoli for exchange, hence oxygen could not be absorbed even under respiratory support. This is similar to the unfortunate outcome of many who had SARS, with a transparent film-forming in the lungs blocking the gas exchange.&#x200B;>DeepTech: Where does this mucus come from?**Gong:** mainly inflammatory secretions from lung inflammation, and may contain some necrotic epithelial cells.&#x200B;>DeepTech: Your paper mentioned that there is a link between dead cases and nutrition support. Why?**Gong:** The patients who died had varying degrees of malnutrition. As mentioned previously, they had multiple organ dysfunction, including hypoproteinemia and anemia. If you can eat actively, you would maintain a better immune function, thus have a better chance of recovery.Therefore, even patients with mild symptoms should also pay attention to what they eat. **We encourage them to eat more, to maintain normal nutrition and a normal immune function.** Those elderly patients, however, may depend on the support of parenteral nutrition.&#x200B;>DeepTech: How does a bacterial infection occur along with coronavirus?**Gong:** The total number of neutrophils before the death of the patient was elevating. PCT (procalcitonin), an indicator of bacterial infection, was also increasing. Both indicated that most of the dead patients would have complicated bacterial infections during their final time.  These are secondary bacterial infection caused by their weakened immune systems.",(Translation) A really informative interview with an infectious disease specialist in Wuhan,2020-02-29 01:30:48,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fba7qb/translation_a_really_informative_interview_with/

fj3652a,-0.9951,0.0,"And here’s the machine translation of the interview: Interview with Gong Zuojiong DeepTech: A study published on the preprinted website Medrxiv on February 12th said that the mortality rate of male new crown patients is three times that of female patients, which is significantly different from your results (male to female ratio 10:15)? Gong Zuojiong: Our research is to find out what caused the death of patients and what the characteristics of death are.  At present, the study is only a retrospective study of a small sample for a specific period of time and cannot represent the probability of a large sample. We mainly emphasized the conclusion that in addition to the elderly, the 25 dead patients are basic diseases. The most important basic disease is hypertension, and then diabetes and heart disease.  However, no survey of lifestyle habits such as smoking history was conducted. DeepTech: How is the situation of these dead patients different from other severe patients? Gong Zuojiong: This is related to many factors, including respiratory support method and timing (respiratory support method refers to invasive or non-invasive, and timing is the time to apply ventilator support), and it is also related to early warning.  Of course, it is more related to the severity of the underlying disease. Our research shows that indicators of these underlying diseases, including cardiac and coagulation function indicators, as well as CRP and SAA indicators can be used as predictors of disease progression and death progression to some extent.  If some patients are severely ill at an early stage and the course of the disease is too long, causing irreversible harm, the effect of respiratory support will be affected. DeepTech: Why do some young infected people die? Gong Zuojiong: This is related to the timing of disease warning and the timing of treatment.  So now we need to establish an early-warning evaluation system. How can we intervene earlier and more proactively in order to reduce mortality? DeepTech: I see the saying that respiratory support treatment is divided into four steps: first, high flow oxygen therapy, if not, then go to a non-invasive ventilator, and if it doesn't work, it needs to be intubated.  The last option is artificial lung (ECMO).  Is that right? Gong Zuojiong: This is a classification of respiratory support, a gradual process.  Early oxygen therapy is definitely beneficial, but an autopsy that has not been published recently shows that late patients have many secretions in the lower respiratory tract. Improper positive pressure oxygenation may press viscous secretions into the alveoli and cause alveolar ventilation.  obstacle.  This is a speculation, so these treatment mechanisms need pathological results to further confirm that the pathogenesis of death or the key cause of death in the end need to be revealed by autopsy results. Earlier, the research of Academician Wang Fusheng on ""The Lancet · Respiratory Medicine"" on February 17 was only the result of puncturing and obtaining tissue samples after the patient's death. It cannot represent the results of autopsy.  We need the results of pathological analysis of autopsy. (DeepTech Note: According to media reports, after completing the dissection of the first case of deceased patients with new coronary pneumonia in the early morning of February 16, Liu Liang, a professor of the Department of Forensic Medicine of Tongji Medical College and the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Forensic Association, and his team have obtained 9  Pathological samples of the deceased. Liu Liang believes that there are many mucus-like secretions on the lung slices of deceased patients with new coronary pneumonia. As long as the patient's airway mucus is not dissolved, oxygen will be counterproductive.) DeepTech: Is using ECMO the final option? Gong Zuojiong: In fact, it seems that the effect of going to ECMO may not absolutely save the lives of patients.  In fact, whether it is invasive intubation or ECMO, as long as it cannot be taken offline, the deterioration of the condition cannot be avoided.  So in the end, it depends on whether the patient's vital signs, respiratory function, and biochemical indicators can be improved under the condition of respiratory support, which can reflect the severity of the disease and prognosis. DeepTech: Some people describe the death of patients with new coronary pneumonia like this: they have difficulty breathing until the last few minutes and the patient is awake.  The patient would call for help, crying and shouting, ""Doctor, save me ..."" With a violent struggle, until the last breath was exhaled. Gong Zuojiong: This is possible.  The patient had an invasive ventilator including an intubation. He was unable to express it, but sometimes the disease did not cause mental disturbance or loss of consciousness. The last manifestation was respiratory failure, so the process was painful. In fact, they died of suffocation, because there was a large amount of mucus in the lungs, oxygen could not enter the alveoli for gas exchange, and oxygen could not be absorbed, and finally suffocated.  At this time oxygen does not work.  This is similar to the final outcome of SARS patients, with a transparent film forming in the lungs and no gas exchange. DeepTech: Where do these mucus come from? Gong Zuojiong: It is mainly an inflammatory secretion of lung inflammation, and may contain some necrotic epithelial cells. DeepTech: Your paper concludes that dead patients are also related to nutritional support.  why? Gong Zuojiong: The dead patients all have different degrees of malnutrition. They have multiple organ dysfunction, including hypoproteinemia and anemia.  If you can eat actively and maintain normal immune function, then the patient's chances of recovery will be higher. Therefore, patients with mild symptoms should also pay attention to it. We encourage them to eat more, to maintain normal nutrition, and to maintain their normal immune function.  Those elderly patients may depend on the support of parenteral nutrition. DeepTech: How does a bacterial infection occur? Gong Zuojiong: The total number of neutrophils before the death of the patient was elevated. PCT (procalcitonin) is also an indicator of bacterial infection, which also indicates that when the patient eventually dies, most of them will be accompanied by bacterial infection.  This is a bacterial infection secondary to a weakened immune system.",(Translation) A really informative interview with an infectious disease specialist in Wuhan,2020-02-29 01:30:48,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fba7qb/translation_a_really_informative_interview_with/
fj35zvk,-0.9951,0.0,"Machine translation: Why do patients with new coronary pneumonia die?  What are the characteristics of death? On February 26, the preprinted journal MedRxiv published a paper ""Clinical Analysis of 25 Cases of Death from New Coronavirus Pneumonia: A Retrospective Study of the Wuhan Single Center in China"" from the People's Hospital of Wuhan University. The corresponding author of the paper is Wuhan University.  Gong Zuojiong, director of the infection department of the People's Hospital.  This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of deaths among patients with neo-coronary pneumonia, hoping to detect critically ill patients early and reduce their mortality. Of the 25 deaths, all patients died of respiratory failure.  Gong Zuojiong told DeepTech, ""They died of suffocation, because there was a large amount of mucus in the lungs, oxygen could not enter the alveoli for gas exchange, and oxygen could not be absorbed, and eventually suffocated."" The development of the course of these death patients is related to many factors, including the type and timing of respiratory support, and early warning. Of course, it is more related to the severity of the underlying disease.  Gong Zuojiong suggested that an early-warning evaluation system should be established so that early and more active intervention can reduce the mortality rate. All patients died of respiratory failure Researchers sorted out 25 deaths from January 14 to February 13, 2020, Wuhan University People's Hospital, and analyzed their clinical records, laboratory test results, and lung CT results.Of the 25 deaths, 10 were males and 15 were females. The average age of the patients was 71.48 ± 12.42, and the course of disease was between 6 and 15 days. All patients died of respiratory failure.  This indicates that the lung is the most important target organ for neocrown virus. All patients have underlying diseases, of which 16 have hypertension, 10 have diabetes, 8 have heart disease, 5 have kidney disease, 4 have cerebral infarction, 2 have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 2 have malignant disease.  Of the tumors, 1 had acute pancreatitis. In addition to the lungs, the organs of the deceased are heart, kidney and liver.  In the last examination of the deceased, the total number of white blood cells increased in 17 cases, the neutrophil count increased in 18 cases, and the lymphocyte count decreased in 22 cases. 90.5% of the dead experienced elevated PCT (procalcitonin) levels.  PCT is a diagnostic marker for bacterial infections.  The percentages of CRP and SAA increased before death were 85% and 100%, respectively, indicating a severe inflammatory cascade in patients who died.  CRP is an indicator of inflammation, which plays an important role in the host's defense against invading pathogens and inflammation, while SAA is a plasma protein that transports lipids during inflammation. The researchers concluded that age and underlying disease are the most risk factors for death in patients with new coronary pneumonia.  Bacterial infection may also be an important factor in accelerating death, and malnutrition is common in critically ill patients. A previous study of 4021 confirmed cases showed that nearly half of patients were over 50 years old, accounting for 47.7%, of which 60% and over accounted for 26.2%.  From the perspective of mortality, the mortality rate of patients aged 60 years and over is 5.3%, which is significantly higher than 1.4% of patients under 60 years of age, and there are many comorbidities. People with severe new-type coronavirus pneumonia progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, difficult-to-correct metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy. This study also confirms the conclusion that the mortality rate of elderly patients with new coronary pneumonia is higher. Why are older people more symptomatic?  According to the Essentials for the Prevention and Treatment of New Type Coronavirus Pneumonia in the Elderly (Trial) published by the Chinese Journal of Geriatrics, there are many age-related changes in the respiratory and immune systems.  Changes in lung anatomy and muscle atrophy in the elderly lead to changes in the physiological functions of the respiratory system, reduced airway clearance, reduced lung reserve, decreased defense barrier function, and decreased immune response.  After infection with the new coronavirus, the elderly population is more prone to inflammatory factor storms and progress to acute respiratory failure.",(Translation) A really informative interview with an infectious disease specialist in Wuhan,2020-02-29 01:30:48,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fba7qb/translation_a_really_informative_interview_with/

It is unlikely that they would have been reinfected having cleared the virus, as they would most likely have mounted an immune response to the virus that would prevent such reinfection.  The other possibility therefore is that they did not in fact clear the infection but remained persistently infected.   Although coronaviruses generally cause short-term self-limiting infections which are cleared, there is some evidence in the scientific literature for persistent infections of animal coronaviruses (mainly in bats). Clearly we need more information about these patients, such as were there underlying medical conditions or a change in circumstances that might have allowed the virus to escape immune control?

This is an automated translation:Is the virus infections during the incubation period?Available facts show that the new coronavirus infects when the patient is ill and in connection with the illness. The knowledge and experience we have right now also shows that people do not become infected during the incubation period, that is, the time span between the time of infection and when the disease breaks out. However, those who have been exposed to infection should be aware of early signs of illness.We base our position on, among other things, the following:There are solid scientific studies and a scientific evaluation on the coronavirus that causes the disease sars, which spread throughout the world in spring 2003. Evaluations from that outbreak clearly show that the sars-coronavirus does not infect at all during the incubation period. Among all known viral diseases, it is very uncommon to be infected during the incubation period. However, many viruses are infected when the disease breaks out. There is therefore much evidence of a similar course of events even for the new coronavirus covid-19.Many export cases of the ongoing covid-19 outbreak from China have now been identified. Among these cases, there are no confirmed descriptions of infection spread during the incubation period.Knowledge about the new corona virus is added every day and we follow the knowledge situation closely. If new facts emerge that give us reasons to change our assessments, we will communicate this. The Public Health Authority cooperates closely with the WHO on these issues.",Swedish Public Health Authority: the Coronavirus doesn't spread during its asymptomatic phase (repost with source),2020-02-29 02:45:29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbavsp/swedish_public_health_authority_the_coronavirus/

I was hoping that the mapping sub-team was going to tackle this but I haven't had time  to check in on that, but what is going on is that every country treats the cruise ship like ""other"" even though they are their own citizens. Even the US.  Even the president openly said on a presidential address that ""we didn't have to take them back but we did"".   As sad as that is, that may have actually saved many hundreds, thousands of lives in the US if the repatriated passengers end up causing uncontrolled outbreak clusters.    That's worst case thinking, but given the chain of events to date, its possible if the US bungle it just as bad as the Japanese its not unlikely either.  The Diamond Princess passengers are in an interesting ""other"" category, as they represent an early non-China cluster that became uncontrollable.  Now those uncontrollable (\~700) are distributed because they couldn't manage the infectious disease in ONE SHIP through modern control protocols.

The hospitals will be swamped, while the head of CDC will be on TV, telling us to go visit www.cdc.gov for “helpful tips”.","NYT: Censoring the truth about the coronavirus did not work out well for Xi Jinping and won't work out for the White House, experts say.",2020-02-29 04:11:39,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbboos/nyt_censoring_the_truth_about_the_coronavirus_did/

fj3cxvl,-0.9082,0.4215,"Translation part 1 :Dear Minister,You assure the country that we are ready to face the new coronavirus, and yet certain key frontline players, nurses and doctors, are not reassured, and neither am I.I am a doctor of science and I have led a group of researchers studying human coronaviruses in general, and the group responsible for the SARS epidemic, SARS-CoV, in particular. I did this work in two institutions, as a member of the faculty of the College of Medicine at the University of Cincinnati and as an investigator at the only institute in the world devoted exclusively to research on respiratory diseases, in Albuquerque, where I had the opportunity to study all aspects of aerosol production and aerosol transmission. In these two institutions, I was one of the officers responsible for ensuring that all experiments involving infectious or recombinant agents comply with all the rules and do not pose a danger to the general public.I have already sent you a file via the SPF Health website on February 12, which indicates that if the proportion of symptomatic cases due to the new coronavirus reaches 1% of the population, we would be on the verge of a hospital crisis due to lack of beds (your reference: CCAL0331485). It went unanswered and that's why I'm writing to you directly.Your public statements suggest that you do not fully understand the nature of the danger that Belgium and the rest of the world face. I would like to draw your attention to two essential points about the new coronavirus which seem to have been given insufficient consideration.In an interview published on Wednesday 26, you answer the question ""But how many beds do we have exactly?"" : ""You know that in Belgium we have enough beds and a sufficient treatment capacity. This is an advantage. When we compare with a winter flu and the number of elderly patients who are generally hospitalized, the situation is identical"" .In my file, I cited the WHO, which on February 10 estimated that ~ 16% of symptomatic patients were in a condition serious enough to require hospitalization. Influenza ? ~ 0.2% of cases! The relationship between the two? A factor of 80 is therefore not an identical situation, the first essential point that is overlooked.The WHO fact-finding mission to China released its report yesterday, it is worth consulting. We now have more precise figures for symptomatic patients: 80% of mild cases (can stay at home), 13% of severe cases (hospitalization), 6% of critical cases (intensive care).Would you be so kind, Madam Minister, you who have access to all the information on the Belgian hospital network, to calculate for our edification to all: from how many symptomatic cases would the Belgian hospital system run out hospital beds for severe and critical cases?There is a cacophony of incorrect information circulating not only in the written and audiovisual press about the new coronavirus, but also on the SPF Health and Sciensano websites. The official position appears to be that COVID-19 is a SARS-2.0 and therefore the measures that would be appropriate for SRAS-1.0 will be suitable for COVID-19.This is unfortunately a false equivalence and it is urgent to understand the essential difference between the spread of the virus responsible for SARS-1.0 and that of the new coronavirus. SARS-CoV was mainly transmitted by surface contamination and by postillions, which travel no more than one meter, but rarely by aerosol. Everything indicates that a significant proportion of transmission of the new coronavirus is by aerosol, which completely changes the situation for isolation measures.The first cases of SARS in November 2002 were detected in the city of Shenzhen, 7 million people at the time, and ultimately infected 5,327 people in China. The first cases of COVID-19 were detected in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, 11 million inhabitants, and have infected 78,497 individuals in China to date (according to the Chinese government; nearly one million after some epidemiologists), the first indication of the difference between the two viruses.The basic reproduction number of the new coronavirus is between 4.7 and 7 according to the calculations of different epidemiologists, which is different from the actual reproduction number calculated by the WHO (2.5), the difference being that the number base corresponds to the situation without isolation measures, and the actual number changes depending on the implementation of different isolation measures.",R0 between 4.7 and 7 : Dr. Marc Wathelet is a molecular biologist who led a team of researchers in the United States,2020-02-29 04:18:23,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbbr3b/r0_between_47_and_7_dr_marc_wathelet_is_a/
fj3cyon,-0.9804,0.4215,"Translation part 2 :Take the situation of Italy. The first two cases are confirmed in Milan on January 31 and we are 655 cases 28 days later. The epidemiology tells us to take the logarithm to base 2 of 655 cases divided by the two initial cases, namely roughly 8.3, and therefore the number of cases doubled every 3.3 days, close to doubling all 2.4 days in the absence of insulation, and while insulation measures have been in place for a few days. These figures are consistent with a high number of reproductions.So, we have an epidemic at least 10 times larger than SARS-1.0 at the same time in China, a new coronavirus of great intrinsic contagiousness, epidemiologists who calculate that one infection in two could be caused by a person still asymptomatic, and we also have multiple episodes of super contagion. What to conclude? You will not find many transmission experts who will tell you anything else that this new virus can be transmitted by aerosol, the second essential point that has been overlooked so far.You recognize that the virus is more contagious, but what is the implication? If the flu virus infects 2 to 8% of the population, year after year, and this virus is more contagious than the flu, what will prevent it from spreading at least like the flu in an immunologically naive population?With the absence at the present time of a vaccine or an effective treatment against this new coronavirus, the question of availability of hospital beds takes all its meaning and its urgency, given the much higher rate of complications with this coronavirus.It is not necessary to have a debate among the experts, although in a crisis situation it is always good to confront the divergent views of the experts, because the Public Health function asks it to prepare for the worst scenario , not the most rosy. Experts and officials in other western countries also recognize the seriousness of the risk we all face.You told us that the objective is to ""keep the virus out of the country as long as possible thanks to adequate surveillance of the territory"", but we learn from a courageous nurse who returns from Veneto, a region of Italy with a few cases of COVID-19, that not only are we not asking them to isolate themselves, and we are asking them to return to work immediately, but we are also refusing to test them!Not only is it not tested, but it also tells us that there is in fact an omerta against screening for the new coronavirus for cases of flu symptoms not related to a Chinese connection. Explain to us, Madam Minister, exactly how you adequately monitor the territory when the most basic screening is not done?We also wonder about the lack of recommendation, screening, quarantine and supervision for people returning to Belgium from a contaminated area, also knowing that the incubation period can exceed two weeks and that there are cured patients who have been reinfected.General practitioners are concerned about the lack of serious communication from the Ministry of Health, an email is not enough in this situation. They contrast the current response to that during the H1N1 epidemic in 2009 when they received clear information and masks. Nor should we ignore their request to have a system in place to support individuals who should remain isolated.Why wait to protect medical personnel when the Chinese government admits that more than 3,000 medical personnel have been infected in Wuhan? Would we be so short of the necessary equipment? What is the situation from a logistical point of view? You say we are ready, but we would not even have masks for general practitioners?What should we say to the families of infected or even deceased medical personnel, if we were to deplore victims whose infection could have been prevented by earlier implementation of personal protection measures?Zhong Nanshan, who heads the COVID-19 team of experts at the Chinese Ministry of Health, said the epidemic had been ""a hard lesson"" for the country: ""If we had taken strict preventive measures in early December or even early January, we would have greatly reduced the number of sick, ""he said at a press conference.The Chinese authorities made the same initial error with SARS and COVID-19, but have since mobilized to fight the virus with the extremely strict measures that are necessary when a virus is transmitted by aerosol and asymptomatically. We are making the same initial mistake as the Chinese!And lessons must now be learned from the first phase of this epidemic, how the Chinese have moved from a very large quarantine model, 400 million people, to a flexible and targeted approach. The number of cases that will emerge as the population returns to normal remains to be seen, but the very advanced surveillance system suggests that they will be able to contain these new cases.Shouldn't we follow the lessons of China, and also follow the adage that prevention is better than cure? Today, faced with this coronavirus, we have no vaccine or treatment available, which, logically, should push us to implement a whole series of preventive actions given this lack of cure solutions. It is imperative to mobilize the population and all healthcare personnel to enable prevention to play its role through an information campaign on the scale of the challenge facing Belgium.Fear can be rational, as fear can be irrational. Fear is an essential emotion for our survival, and we must be able to listen to it. Please keep your fingers crossed that Belgium will be spared and that the spread of the virus will slow down with the end of winter, but I think that the government, whose fundamental function is to protect the public, could do more in this situation and I remain at your disposal if my expertise can be useful.",R0 between 4.7 and 7 : Dr. Marc Wathelet is a molecular biologist who led a team of researchers in the United States,2020-02-29 04:18:23,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbbr3b/r0_between_47_and_7_dr_marc_wathelet_is_a/

I totally agree that healthcare workers are the priority but the whole ‘masks don’t work’ argument feels empty to me. I participated in full donning and doffing training for Ebola along with the entire health system I worked for and while it’s easy to make mistakes it’s not rocket science. I’ve taught my kids how to properly wear and remove masks. Masks are essential for essential workers and we should prioritize them. It’s also true that regular surgical masks provide a lower level of protection and when worn/handled incorrectly can lead to infection. But the barrier can help protect against some droplets which is better than nothing. And public education is possible.

Mutual suspicion since the 1962 war has kept the two peoples at arm's length. Chinese people do not typically consider india as a tourism wonderland and vice versa. Wealthier china typically holidays in Europe, Australia or Thailand, Ditto for wealthier indians. India is not exactly a regional hub for airports the scale of Singapore, Bangkok or Dubai/Qatar. Chinese labor in India is non-existant, indian labor in China? Good luck getting visas. Unlike Singapore, Korea, Japan, California and Australia which are within the Pacific belt for generations of Chinese immigrants, except a few thousand WW2 immigrants, india is not home to any Mandarin/Cantonese Chinese descendants. Tibeteans are a different story, have always been.

fj3gprp,-0.6943,0.0," Almost 100 foreign citizens who had been in China — many of them “business leaders” — were snuck in Australia’s back door after the federal government gave them an exemption from the coronavirus travel ban.It is understood the business leaders, diplomats and other travellers allowed to enter Australia passed an initial health screening and state health departments rubber-stamped the request. Each individual was also required to self-isolate for 14 days.However, medical research platform medRxiv has warned that, based on cases from China, symptoms may not manifest themselves for as long as 24 days.Obviously there is also the concern that one or more of these special exemptions may have broken their self-isolation at some stage.The Sunday Telegraph can reveal that Australia’s border boss authorised border clearance for 99 non-citizens.Last month the government announced any foreigner who had travelled to China would not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left.The National Security Committee of Cabinet agreed to the ban on February 1 in an attempt to try and stop the spread of the coronavirus.On Friday the government extended its coronavirus travel ban for another week amid fears a Covid-19 global pandemic will soon be declaredThe ban does not apply to Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family as well as aircrews.The government confirmed that Australia’s Border Force Commissioner has used his discretionary powers on 28 occasions to permit entry to 99 foreigners.A spokesman from the Department of Home Affairs said the Commissioner only used discretionary powers in “compelling or compassionate circumstances” and where the relevant health authorities support the request.Diplomats who are residents in Australia and Chinese citizens receiving treatment in Australia or visiting sick loved ones were also among those smuggled in.Last month Chinese woman Xianglan Ren was also allowed to enter Australia to see her son Li Changxiang before doctors at the Royal Melbourne Hospital turned off his life support.","AUSTRALIA: Business leaders from China are among around 100 foreign citizens who have been given exemptions from travel bans, and ""snuck in the back door"".

fj3lpg5,0.9836,0.0,"Whoops. Didn’t think about the paywall. Here’s the text:I have the coronavirus. And it hasn’t been that bad.I am in my late 60s, and the sickest I’ve ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out on my back for a few days. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don’t have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual.I caught the virus on the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for 14 days, at the end of a 16-day cruise I took with my wife, Jeri. When I left the ship a couple of weeks ago, I felt fine. We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine. Jeri and I got a swab test for the virus. Our temperatures were normal; they’d get the swab results back in 48 hours. Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport, where two U.S. government planes waited for us.As we took off from Tokyo, I had a bit of a cough, but I chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin. I felt pretty tired — but who wouldn’t, in our situation? I dozed off.When I woke up, I had a fever. I made my way to the back of the cargo plane, where the Air Force had set up a quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic. They took my temperature. It was over 103 degrees. So I took a seat in the quarantine area and fell back asleep until we touched down in California, at Travis Air Force Base.Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came onto the plane and said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha (with our spouses, if they wanted to come along). The CDC had a quarantine location at the University of Nebraska’s hospital. We arrived on Feb. 17, greeted by a fleet of ambulances and police cars. Officials put me on a stretcher and wheeled me into a van, which made for a very dramatic scene. I easily could have walked myself, despite my exhaustion.On the hospital campus, they put me in a biocontainment unit. The space was sealed off, with two double-paned windows that looked out on the hallway, and a large, heavy, insulated door. Two cameras watched me at all times; a set of computer monitors were equipped with microphones, so that the medical staff and I could communicate with CDC officials at central command down the hall. The room had last been used for the Ebola outbreak in 2014.While there is no vaccine for coronavirus, preventive steps and awareness are the best tools to prepare and protect yourself in the event of an outbreak.  A doctor and nurses reviewed my case with me and took a bunch of lab tests. They wore heavy-duty hazmat suits sealed with duct tape and equipped with motors that helped with air circulation. It looked like something out of “The Andromeda Strain.” When the test came back a few hours later, I wasn’t surprised to learn that I had the coronavirus. Later, the Tokyo swab confirmed the result — I had caught the virus even before I left the ship.It didn’t scare me too badly. I knew my number was up. The way I saw it, I was going to get stuck in at least 14 more days of quarantine, even if I didn’t get the virus. So many fellow passengers had come down with the illness, including one of my friends, that I’d gotten somewhat used to the idea that I might catch it, too. My wife, however, tested negative and headed to quarantine at a separate facility a few blocks away. After those days being cooped up on the ship together, I think we both relished the alone time; we still could communicate through our phones.During the first few days, the hospital staff hooked me up to an IV, mostly as a precaution, and used it to administer magnesium and potassium, just to make sure I had plenty of vitamins. Other than that, my treatment has consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade — and, when my fever rose just above 100 degrees, some ibuprofen. The nurses came to the room every four hours or so, to check my vitals, ask if I needed anything and to draw my blood. I got very good at unhooking all the monitors checking my oxygen level, blood pressure and heart rate so I could go to the bathroom or just pace around the room a little, to get my blood flowing. I never quite got the hang of hooking them back up without making a tangled mess. After 10 days, I moved out of biocontainment and into the same facility as Jeri. Now we can videochat from our separate quarantines, in neighboring rooms.As of my most recent test, on Thursday, I am still testing positive for the virus. But by now, I don’t require much medical care. The nurses check my temperature twice a day and draw my blood, because I’ve agreed to participate in a clinical study to try to find a treatment for coronavirus. If I test negative three days in a row, then I get to leave.The time has passed more quickly than I would’ve expected. With my laptop, I get as much work done as I can, remotely. I catch up with friends. I take walks around my room, trying to take a thousand more steps each day. I also watch the news. It’s surreal to see everyone panic — news conferences, the stock market falling, school closures — about a disease I have. It does seem likely that coronavirus will spread in the United States, but it won’t help anybody if we all panic. It’s true that the disease seems much more likely to be fatal for older people and those in poor health. I’m relatively fortunate: I’m still younger than the most at-risk groups, and I’m in good shape, giving me less cause for alarm. Others who contract the virus won’t be as lucky. At least six Diamond Princess passengers have died from the disease, of around 705 passengers who caught it.Still, coronavirus doesn’t have to be a horrible calamity. Based on my experience, I’d recommend that everyone get a good digital thermometer, just as a comfort tool, so they can reassure themselves if their noses start running.If you told me when I left home in January that I wouldn’t be back until March — that, instead, I would be confined for more than 24 days because I’d catch a novel virus at the center of what could become a pandemic — that would have completely freaked me out. But now that it’s happening, I’m just taking it one day at a time.As told to Post editor Sophia Nguyen.","‘I have the corona virus.

I believe that the press lies about causes of death to fan the flames of a fake news story invented by the people who are profiting and will profit from it.  I have seen research which has led to the identification of a particular virus before.   I don't see it in this case.  The W.H.O.  has put a lot of gibberish on their web site.  This is the same web site where one can find articles showing how others have spent years to identify a particular virus.  I'm  not aware of some breakthrough which now permits it to be done in a week, which seems to be what is being claimed.McNamara now admits that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a fabrication.  The sinking of the Maine was also a hoax.FDR provoked the Japanese to attack Pearl harbor and moved out everything expensive in advance and let them kill 3000 service men in order to bring the usa into the war in europe because the bankers who already owned the usa wanted him to.Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.If you are among those talking about this alleged virus as though the powers that be and the press that they own through their excessive loans and manipulation of their privately owned world currencies can't lie,  maybe you should look at the record of the authorities that you cite.Appeal to authority is one of the main logical FALLACIES which permit people to fool themselves.

fj3p86j,0.9883,0.0,">Marcus Fahn: Good morning. First the most important question: You have been out of the hospital for a few days now. How are you feeling?  >  >Patient: My health is super, I am really in top shape. I have never felt bad either.  >  >Marcus Fahn: I will talk to you about the symptoms and how you have been feeling in a moment. What really interests me: There were probably many attempts by many media outlets in Germany to talk to you. Why do you want to tell your story here on BAVARIA 1 today?  >  >Patient: It was important for me to find a medium in which the reporting is still very neutral. Because of the situation I was in, I naturally read and heard a lot and also looked a lot. And then I had to learn that many things are wrongly reported and are no longer based on facts. That's why it was important to me that it comes across as objectively as possible and such a radio interview is of course predestined for that.  >  >Marcus Fahn: Then thank you very much at this point for your trust. And then I would now like to try to go through the course of events chronologically with you. It is said that you got infected by a colleague from China who was in Germany for a training course. At Webasto. That's a well-known fact by now. Do you now know in retrospect how you got infected? So how close was this contact? Did she just sit in the same room? Was there, for example, a handshake?  >  >Patient: I can't talk directly about the exact whereabouts or the reason for this. You have to ask Webasto. What I can say: We were in the same room. It was six square meters at most. There were four of us. We talked there for about an hour. There was a brief handshake, but the colleague wasn't sick either. Well, I didn't see her sniffing or coughing or showing any symptoms of illness. To me, she was completely healthy.  >  >Marcus Fahn: At that time, the coronavirus was not yet so big in the news. You knew there was something in China somehow. But this was not comparable to the situation at the moment. They got sick a few days later. What was wrong with you?  >  >Patient: The meeting was on Monday and on Friday it started. I had neck scratches, but I thought that it is quite normal at this time of the year, that you get a bit of a scratchy neck. In the evening I got a cough. In the night I actually got a fever. 39 degrees and chills, a little bit of aching limbs, so that I took paracetamol on Saturday to get the fever down. That worked and that was the end of the story. On Sunday I was already well again. Then on Monday I felt fit enough to go back to work.  >  >Marcus Fahn: When did you first think or get the information that it could be this new weird disease from China?  >  >Patient: It was then on Monday when I was back at work. Early in the morning I found out that this colleague I had been in contact with had actually been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Afterwards I immediately went to my family doctor, who referred me to the Tropical Institute.  >  >Marcus Fahn: You were tested and then it turned out that you have this coronavirus. What was your first reaction?  >  >Patient: It was of course a shock at first, because I hadn't expected it. You only knew the virus from the news, from television, and at first I just accepted it. I was told that I had to go to Schwabing and go to a house there. I would be received there. At that time I just reacted.  >  >Marcus Fahn: That means you went to Schwabing on your own.  >  >Patient: That is correct.  >  >Marcus Fahn: How did it go on there then?  >  >Patient: As I said, I went there with my private car. There I parked my car on the premises and was then welcomed by a very friendly nurse. She was also completely clear about the situation and did not panic. She simply took me in, noted down my data and brought me into the room. There my fever was measured again. But I did not have a fever. Then blood was taken and some other swabs. But basically I was then in this room and felt healthy.  >  >Marcus Fahn: What kind of thoughts went through your mind?  >  >Patient: Very different. It all seemed very surreal to me. Of course one couldn't have imagined the situation. Why do I now have to be the only patient or the only person in Germany who has this virus? Why do I have to be the first to have it now? I felt completely healthy. I have never felt my life in danger. That was just completely surreal.  >  >Marcus Fahn: Have you ever been afraid that the symptoms might get worse or reoccur? You heard various things from China.  >  >Patient: No, no, I followed the news. The things the news sometimes described were quite scary. But there were very competent doctors who dealt with much worse things. What we had on the ward, it's nothing compared to what they have to deal with every day. And they also gave us very professional care and reassurance, including the nurses and orderlies. We felt very well looked after there.  >  >Marcus Fahn: In the beginning you were alone, at some point other colleagues came along who also tested positive. What was your everyday life like during all this time? That was a long time in which you were in quarantine.  >  >Patient: It was a very, very boring everyday life. There was no change, the day started with taking fever, which was always negative. I never had a fever. Afterwards I had to give swabs. You had to give swabs from the nose and throat. At some point I had breakfast. Then you worked. I had my laptop with me, so I could work normally from there. And then there was lunch at some point. Then maybe you watched a show. Then there was dinner, and at some point you slept.  >  >Marcus Fahn: Did you have contact to your colleagues, or did you sit more or less alone in the sickroom the whole time?  >  >Patient: Yes, I had contact to my colleagues in the hospital. Of course you can contact them at any time via WhatsApp.  >  >Marcus Fahn: But you were always alone although they had the same things as you?  >  >Patient: I had a single room, so I was actually alone in this single room.  >  >Marcus Fahn: And the nurses and doctors who came in to you? Do you have to imagine them in the same way as you can now partly see them on television? In these full protective suits?  >  >Patient: No, that is exaggerated. Yes, of course they had protective suits. But, what is then shown on television, these full body suits with extra oxygen tanking in them, that did not exist. Of course they put on a real breathing mask and wore some kind of painter's suit. And gloves, but nothing more.  >  >Marcus Fahn: How did you keep in touch with your family during this time?  >  >Patient: As I said, with today's media, this is going quite well. Of course you can keep in touch by video call. You can see each other, you can talk to each other. Of course that helps.  >  >Marcus Fahn: Were you afraid or concerned about your wife and child?  >  >Patient: Of course, that was the first thing I was worried about when I learned at work that the virus had been detected in my colleague. That's why I immediately went to the family doctor. As you know, I have a little daughter who goes to the daycare. And I have a wife who was eleven weeks pregnant at the time. And they are both doing well. They have never been sick and have not been infected by me.  >  >Marcus Fahn: Besides your family, what did you miss most during this time?  >  >Patient: Freedom.

I was there for 18 days. Other colleagues already had no more symptoms. They had also completely rid themselves of the virus, but had to stay there because the criteria for their dismissal had not yet been laid down. And we've been waiting a long time for this.

So I should stay at home until the last piece of DNA of this virus is out of my body.  >  >Marcus Fahn: That means that you are still being tested regularly at the moment?  >  >Patient: That's right, I'm still being tested regularly until it is really proven that even the last spark of this virus is gone. But this does not mean that the corona virus is still active in any way. They are now looking at the DNA. But that's a dead DNA, so to speak.  >  >Marcus Fahn: There was a lot of excitement in the environment of the sick people at Webasto, keyword ""kindergartens"", ""schools"", certainly also in the company itself. How did you feel about that? Patient: There was complete uncertainty again. It is known that I have the virus and that my daughter goes to the nursery. What I have to say is that my daughter's caregivers, i.e. the daily caregivers, handled it very professionally. They were never afraid of it. They are used to it when children have a cold or a cough. They didn't treat them any differently now. She was always healthy. She tested negative, even twice. So she was perfectly healthy. But you could still tell from other parents that they were hysterical. The parents' council of this daycare center also sent the police to the health department, because they thought that the health department should have closed the daycare center.  >  >Marcus Fahn: Let's assume that you were not infected, but someone else in your environment or in the environment of your child. Wouldn't you perhaps have had such fears or at least understood them?  >  >Patient: Well, you have to distinguish between fear and concern. Well, I would have been worried if I had heard that. But I would have been more worried for the person who has it. But if I know that any person has been tested negative and if I then learn that the course of the disease is really not as the media report it, then I would of course calm down again.  >  >Marcus Fahn: Now we have to assume that more people will be infected in the near future. What would you tell or advise them now?  >  >Patient: First of all I would advise everyone to stay calm. It is of course a new virus, that is well known. But it is not as bad as the flu. So this is really a kind of cold. The bad thing is, you can detect the virus and then you are stamped. You just have to accept that. If you don't have any pre-existing conditions, it's never gonna be bad. But if you have a pre-existing condition and you get the flu, for example, then it will be much, much more serious. That's why I would advise everyone to take care of it first: if you have it, stay calm. If you don't have it, you should get vaccinated against the flu.  >  >Marcus Fahn: When do you think that your private life will return to a complete everyday life?  >  >Patient: For me, everyday life is already there.  >  >Marcus Fahn: Well, but you are still at home.  >  >Patient: I am at home, but I am allowed to go out normally. I'm just not allowed to go to work.  >  >Marcus Fahn: How do people in your environment, friends, acquaintances, who know, that was the one with the coronavirus, how do they treat you since you are out?  >  >Patient: They treat me quite normally, because I am very open and honest with these people. They know very well that I was never really seriously ill. And they also know exactly that I am no longer contagious. Everything was tested on me. I've also been to a lung specialist. He took another look. There's nothing to see.  >  >Marcus Fahn: And you would probably wish the same for all the other people in Germany who are now infected with it in the next few days and weeks and then hopefully, and this is how it looks, after a mostly mild course, will at some point be back to normal at home or at work.  >  >Patient: Yes, that is correct.  >  >Marcus Fahn: Thank you very much for telling us your story and your view. I wish you and your family all the best and also the people in your environment that everything will calm down and the last rest of the daily routine will return to you.  >  >Patient: Thank you.",Interview of the first confirmed case in Germany of the Webasto cluster (see comment for full translation),2020-02-29 07:24:40,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbdzq4/interview_of_the_first_confirmed_case_in_germany/

People assume that what befell others won't happen to them. It's not a conspiracy, or stupidity, it's partly hubris really, and the other part is having faulty model of the world. In face of a novel situation, most people genuinely don't know how to adjust their reactions, and worse, they don't realize their lack of knowledge and understanding and how unfit their solutions are to the new situation, so you end up with massive repeated failures that are harder to recover from. Just go through the reports from the past two months, notice the official response of all countries before and after they have been infected, how their local media have been covering it, and how that response is almost identical (with a couple of exceptions), so instead of taking additional actions or spending more resources on preparation, they are lagging behind, and now playing catch-up with the outbreak despite having had a head start -unlike China-.Most people are still unable to see the incoming economical/supply impact because it isn't emphasized upon enough by the media (except for the late new iPhone) or put into preservative how everything has become super connected, a failure in one part has consequential effects on parts that on the surface might seem safe or isolated from the disruption.",Automakers are 'scrambling' for parts and preparing war rooms as coronavirus spreads,2020-02-29 07:31:40,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbe3cv/automakers_are_scrambling_for_parts_and_preparing/

fj3rhjf,-0.9891,0.0,"Archive link http://archive.is/wip/YVKHTThis is a Friday story updated today Officials in California, Oregon and Washington State said on Friday that people had tested positive for the coronavirus without a known explanation for how they became ill.By Mike Baker, Sheri Fink, Thomas Fuller and Nicholas Bogel-BurroughsPublished Feb. 28, 2020Updated Feb. 29, 2020, 10:19 a.m. ETSEATTLE — Troubling new signs that the coronavirus is spreading in the United States emerged on Friday, as cases not explained by overseas travel or contact with a person known to be infected were reported in California, Oregon and Washington State.Officials from the three states announced that their testing had found new cases: a high school student from north of Seattle; an employee of an elementary school in Oregon, near Portland; and a woman in Santa Clara County, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley.Sixty-five cases of the virus have been reported in the United States, but until this week, all of the cases could be explained by overseas travel or contact with someone who had been ill. The three new cases on Friday, and a case earlier in the week, in California, were the first in the United States where the cause was mysterious and unknown — a sign, experts warned, that the virus, which has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide and sickened tens of thousands of others, might now be spreading in this country.MILITARY CASE: U.S. military steps meant to stave off the virus may also compromise training and readiness“If we were worried yesterday, we are even more worried today,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “Now we have to ask: How widely, really widely, is this virus out there?”As word emerged of the unexplained cases, local officials scrambled to trace everyone who had come in contact with those who were ill. California health officials said they were increasing testing. And in Washington State, officials suggested that people needed to prepare for the possibility of schools closing and businesses keeping workers home.“We’re going to be increasingly recommending that people try and avoid crowds and close contact with other people,” Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health Seattle & King County, said. “We may get to a point where we want to recommend canceling large public gatherings — social events, sporting events, entertainment — until we get over a hump of what might be a large outbreak.”LIVE UPDATESFor the latest updates on the new coronavirus, read our live briefing.In some of the new cases, officials described situations where those who were ill may have had contact with many people in recent days.The student in Washington State who tested positive for coronavirus, according to state officials, had visited two health clinics and gone to his school in Snohomish County, Henry M. Jackson High School, on Friday before the diagnosis, although he did not attend classes.Dr. Chris Spitters, health officer of the Snohomish Health District, said he suspected that the teenager probably got sick from someone with a mild form of the illness who did not seek care. “I think we’re going to find as time goes on that there’s more of that,” Dr. Spitters said.In Oregon, a state that had not reported any previous cases of coronavirus, officials said an employee of Forest Hills Elementary School in Lake Oswego appeared to have contracted the virus more than a week ago.Oregon health officials said their public health laboratory, which began testing samples on Friday, had detected the positive case; the sample will also be tested at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation, as will the new cases from Washington and California.In California, a woman from Santa Clara County with chronic health conditions who was hospitalized for a respiratory illness was reported on Friday to have tested positive for infection with the virus. Two days earlier, officials in Solano County, Calif., 90 minutes from Santa Clara County, had announced the first case in the nation with no clear ties to any previous case or overseas travel.In counties in and around each of the new type of cases, officials were bracing for what it might mean for everyday life. Some school districts were adding cleaning staff, scrubbing buildings and preparing for absences from school. Emergency medical officials were weighing new protocols. And some businesses were contemplating what working from home might mean for their operations.One of the cases appeared in Santa Clara County, where Google and Apple have their headquarters and which also includes San Jose, the 10th-largest city in the nation.“This has become very real for everyone in our community,” Sam Liccardo, the mayor of San Jose, said on Friday evening as he prepared to meet with city staff about the implications. “There’s certainly a lot of concern and the concern is justified.”CORONAVIRUS IN CALIFORNIA:Here’s what you need to knowEmergency medical workers in San Jose who answer calls from people with coronavirus-like symptoms will now be instructed to wear protective clothing, he said. “We are going to need to take every reasonable precaution without resorting to panic or finger-pointing.”For weeks, local and state health departments across the country have been stretched thin by the coronavirus outbreak, and the cases of unknown origin signaled a new front in their efforts. “Most public health departments can respond to one case or two cases,” Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a public health professor at Johns Hopkins, said. “But it’s going to be many more than that.”On Friday, California health officials said they had greatly expanded their ability to test for the virus, and experts said the public health response in the affected counties should include examining specimens of people who may have been hospitalized for or killed by a respiratory illness in recent weeks.“This case does signal to us that it’s now time to shift how we respond to the novel coronavirus,” Dr. Sara Cody, the public health director for Santa Clara County, said. “Now we need to add other public health tools to the mix,” including looking systematically for the disease to understand its scope and magnitude, she said.In Solano County, where the first U.S. case of unexplained origin was announced earlier in the week, local officials have fielded calls from scores of concerned residents.“I’m middling alarmed,” said Rick Lodwick, as he tossed a jumbo pack of sanitizing wipes into the back of his car in the parking of a big box store in Vacaville.“When I heard it was here, I thought, ‘We’re going to have trouble,’” Mr. Lodwick said.Solano County, northeast of San Francisco, is a place of cattle ranches, biotechnology research facilities, a military base and vineyards. An investigation was started into all contacts the sick woman from the county might have had with friends, neighbors and medical workers.“People are concerned and they’re paying attention,” said Jeremy Craig, the city manager of Vacaville. “But I don’t think there’s a panic.”Restaurants were full on Friday, the manager of a movie theater said there had been no decline in ticket sales, and it was very rare to see someone wearing a mask.Dr. Bela T. Matyas, the public health officer in Solano County, said officials had begun monitoring dozens of people with whom the woman who fell ill there had interacted in recent weeks — including relatives, co-workers and others she might have had contact with through her job — and had asked them to quarantine themselves at home. At least 124 nurses and other health care workers were under self-quarantine, a nurses’ union reported.The woman was later taken by ambulance to the University of California, Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. At that hospital in recent days, some workers seemed deeply concerned about possible exposure.“I’m worried how this will affect my baby,” said Vickie Poncalo, a cashier at the hospital’s cafe who is seven months pregnant.“Should we be wearing a mask and worrying that people are walking around here?” she asked. “Should I even be here?”Mike Baker reported from Seattle, Thomas Fuller from Vacaville, and Sheri Fink and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs from New York. Reporting was contributed by Julie Checkoway from Sacramento, Joe Purtell from Vacaville and Amy Harmon, Roni Caryn Rabin, Reed Abelson, Knvul Sheikh and Dana Goldstein from New York.",Unexplained Coronavirus Cases in Three States Raise Specter of Spread -NY Times -02/29/2020,2020-02-29 07:48:00,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbeboi/unexplained_coronavirus_cases_in_three_states/

fj3ry92,-0.9894,0.0,"Here’s the South Korea and North Korea story:South Korea reports 813 new cases, and the North calls for an all-out containment effort.South Korea, which has the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China, reported 813 new cases on Saturday, bringing its total to 3,150. In North Korea, Kim Jong-un ordered all-out efforts to fight the virus at a high-level meeting, state media reported.South Korean officials have warned that confirmed cases would rise sharply as they aggressively tested thousands of people, particularly in the southeastern city of Daegu. More than 86 percent of patients have been in Daegu and nearby towns; many have been associated with a church called Shincheonji, which has a strong presence in Daegu.The United States military, which has more than 28,000 personnel in South Korea, said on Saturday that the spouse of an American soldier infected with the virus had also tested positive for it. She had been in self-quarantine since Wednesday, following her husband’s diagnosis, and was being transported to a military hospital, the military said.Also on Saturday, Mr. Kim, North Korea’s leader, convened the Politburo of his ruling party to order an all-out campaign to prevent an outbreak, state media reported. The North has not reported any coronavirus cases, but there has been concern that the secretive, totalitarian country could be hiding an outbreak.“In case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency quoted Mr. Kim as saying. It said that officials had discussed “measures to deter the influx and spread of the infectious disease in a scientific, pre-emptive and lockdown way.”North Korea has already closed its 930-mile border with China, where the coronavirus emerged, and its border with Russia. But the Chinese border has long been porous for smugglers, who ferry goods across the shallow river that separates the countries. The North has also suspended all flights and trains to and from China and asked all foreign diplomats not to leave their compounds.The state media report Saturday also said that Mr. Kim had fired one of his top aides, Ri Man-gon, and another official for corruption, but it was unclear whether the dismissals were connected to the antivirus campaign.——-Here’s the story on France:France will ban large gatherings as Europe battles the spread of virus.France will ban gatherings of more than 5,000 people in enclosed spaces and all gatherings in Oise, its region most affected by the coronavirus, the country’s health minister said on Saturday, as he reported a further 16 confirmed cases of the virus.That brings France’s total cases to 73, more than 50 of which were confirmed in the past few days. Of the country’s coronavirus cases, 59 remain hospitalized, 12 have been released, and two have died.The minister, Olivier Véran, also said at a news conference Saturday afternoon that a half-marathon scheduled for Sunday in Paris would be canceled.In some areas in Oise and in Haute-Savoie, a southeastern region that is home to the other cluster of infections in France, schools will be closed starting on Monday, the minister said.MIPIM, a giant annual real-estate event held in Cannes, France, that had been scheduled for March, also announced on Saturday that it would be postponed until June.",Coronavirus Live Updates: South Korea Confirms Over 800 New Cases -NYTimes- live update page for 2/29/2020,2020-02-29 07:54:03,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbeetx/coronavirus_live_updates_south_korea_confirms/

fj3su97,-0.9833,-0.1154,"The coronavirus is particularly dangerous to older people, but the Japanese authorities have maintained strict constraints on testing for it.By Ben Dooley, Motoko Rich and Makiko InoueFeb. 29, 2020, 10:35 a.m. ETTOKYO — My Home Harumi, a nursing home in central Tokyo, is on lockdown.Volunteers, service providers and even family members are turned away in hopes of keeping the center sealed against the spreading coronavirus. A sense of crisis pervades the home as employees wear masks, constantly wash their hands and disinfect every surface, said its deputy director, Kumi Iwasaki.It’s a life-or-death mission: The virus kills older people at a far higher rate. The battle is being waged all across Japan, which has the highest proportion of elderly people in the world, as the number of reported cases in the country has steadily climbed to 230, with 11 deaths, mostly among people in their 80s. Globally, nearly 3,000 people have died, the vast majority in China.Other countries with aging populations, like South Korea and Italy, which have both experienced recent surges in infections, are also facing acute challenges. Those two countries have done just what experts recommend: They have moved quickly to test large numbers of people so they can be treated and isolated from others.But after weeks of caution, the Japanese government has only just begun to take more aggressive action, most notably by moving to close schools for a month. That step, though, was aimed at the young, who often show only mild symptoms or none at all when infected, not vulnerable older people, who sometimes develop severe pneumonia.All the while, officials have maintained strict constraints on testing for the virus, which has only added to the fears about risks to the elderly.South Korea is conducting more than 10,000 tests a day; Japan, by contrast, is performing only a tiny fraction of that. What’s more, the Japanese authorities recommend that elderly patients be tested for the coronavirus only after they have had a fever for at least two days (for most others, it is four days).That may be too late for many older people, said Masahiro Kami, a physician and executive director of the Tokyo-based nonprofit Medical Governance Research Institute.“What we know is that older patients are the most vulnerable, and once they get sick or ill, they quickly deteriorate,” Dr. Kami said. “They should definitely not wait two days.”He speculated that the limitations might be driven by politics, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeks to keep the spread of the virus from derailing the Tokyo Olympics. “It may be Abe or someone around him wants to downplay the number of infections or patients because of the upcoming Olympics,” Dr. Kami said.Whatever the motivation, given Japan’s large aging population — about 29 percent of its 36 million people are 65 or older — experts said the country’s testing gap could leave the most vulnerable people exposed.“What you’re telling me is that Japan is a senior living facility at a larger scale,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. “That would motivate me, if I were the minister of health, to test more broadly and to open up testing.”Mr. Abe promised on Saturday to make testing more widely available. Speaking during a hastily called news conference, he acknowledged that the screenings had been insufficient and said that the government would add the procedures to the national health insurance plan and expand the number of locations able to administer them.Japan currently has the capacity to conduct about 4,000 tests a day, but it has carried out less than half that number on any given day since the crisis began, according to statistics provided by the health ministry.That approach differs dramatically from those of other places in East Asia that have been hit by the virus.South Korea, which reported on Saturday that cases in the country had risen to 3,150, has offered drive-through testing in Daegu, a hard-hit city, and other places, while in Hong Kong, clinics have begun to give residents kits that allow them to take the tests at home and send them to a lab.“You wonder, if they were testing nearly as much as South Korea is testing, what would the actual number be? How many cases are lurking and just aren’t being caught?” said Tobias Harris, an expert on Japanese politics at Teneo Intelligence in Washington.Making the problem worse, only a small number of public health centers in Japan have been authorized to provide the tests, which can be processed by just five companies selected by the government, creating a potential bottleneck.That has forced clinics to turn patients away, even when they are presenting serious symptoms like high fever, according to news reports and statements from the Japan Medical Association, which said it had begun looking into the issue.Erika Tamada, 33, a nursery school teacher from Hyogo Prefecture who lives with her 59-year-old parents, 83-year-old grandfather and younger sister, said both her mother and grandfather had had fevers and other symptoms, including runny noses and coughs.But neither of them has been able to get tested for the virus, by local public health clinics or by the hospital they visited. Ms. Tamada said she was taken aback when a doctor at a health center told them to “wash hands, gargle and just work hard not to get infected.”It is not clear why Japan lags behind other governments in the region in its ability to test for the virus.Yasuyuki Kato, a professor of infectious diseases at the International University of Health and Welfare in Narita, Japan, said the country had been largely untouched by past outbreaks of coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, giving it a false sense of security.Among the “neighboring countries of China, only Japan has no experience of managing any of the diseases,” he said, adding that there was “insufficient preparedness” for handling an emerging illness.Policymakers in Japan first came under heavy criticism for their response when they instituted a quarantine of the cruise ship Diamond Princess, where the pathogen rapidly spread among passengers, crew members and the medical professionals tasked with providing care.Despite the severity of the outbreak, the authorities were slow to test those on the ship, saying that resources were limited. Feverish passengers waited in their cabins for days without seeing a doctor, and once the two-week isolation period ended, the authorities allowed a number of people who had been exposed to the virus to slip away untested, without submitting to an additional quarantine.Experts said the government needed to strike the right balance on screening for the virus. Some worry that if testing is increased too much, the nation’s health care system could be overwhelmed.Hospitals in metropolitan areas are already filled with patients exhibiting mild symptoms, said Masaya Yamato, a doctor at the Rinku General Medical Center in Osaka. If the number of patients increases dramatically, that could hinder care for the most serious cases, he said.“Most hospitals are not used to accepting such patients, so they can’t save patients who should be saved,” he said, adding that difficult cases leave medical workers “exhausted.”“If they have many such patients,” he added, “it makes it more difficult for hospitals to treat older patients with serious conditions.”Reporting was contributed by Hisako Ueno and Eimi Yamamitsu from Tokyo; Su-Hyun Lee from Seoul, South Korea; and Tiffany May from Hong Kong.","In Graying Japan, Many Are Vulnerable but Few Are Being Tested -NYTimes -02/29/2020",2020-02-29 08:02:52,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbeji4/in_graying_japan_many_are_vulnerable_but_few_are/

And then, they did decide to test any negative flu results, but they distributed faulty tests and wouldn’t let states test on their own. People were able to fly from the epicenter in China from early December to late January before Wuhan was quarantined and US stopped flights from China. And then, community spread happened in other countries, but they were not screening those people coming in. WHO doesn’t recommend travel bans. So, that was fine that they didn’t. However, the respond should have been to ramp up testing. They didn’t.

Transparency and honesty of government, competency in macro management and a well-educated population with social consciousness.That's how we caught so many cases so early on.

The main problem I see is an undefined chain of command. I’m in the fourth largest populated area in the United States and no one has any idea who they will report to or who has ultimate authority. And of course Health Departments policy and procedure will vary from state to state.I’ve dealt with several large scale disaster responses in multiple states. The moment you cross city, county, and especially state lines, responses drastically change. Nationally declared disasters in multiple states take years to play out. I couldn’t imagine a successful response scenario for a large scaled disaster impacting more than five states, especially when states might not be in the same regions of the US.

fj4apc6,0.9886,0.0,"One thing that I hear is getting confused is the difference between masks that have exhalation valves and ones that do not. I think they need to make that distinction because their argument doesn’t make any sense otherwise. “You don’t use it because it won’t help you, but we’ll use it... ya know because it helps us.”The best I can understand right now, it wouldn’t be a great idea to rely on masks with valves to keep the disease from spreading when used on sick patients. If this virus is airborne, the valve would let those particles pass freely outside of the mask. If we get sick, then my family will use surgical masks w/o valves. My focus was to buy respirators with valves to help protect us from exposure. I’ll definitely keep my respirators with valves for protective measures along with all of the other best practices of washing hands, etc. We were fortunate to buy a reasonable amount before people started to panic, so I’m not looking to buy anymore. I definitely don’t buy their blanket statement that masks won’t help to prevent you getting the virus.

P95 masks are restrictive making breathing difficult, humid and miserable to wear.

fj45xzr,-0.9849,0.0,"DeepL:>A woman in Bremen is infected with the corona virus. This has been confirmed by the health authorities. The woman showed only mild symptoms, her contact persons were informed and remained in domestic quarantine.  >  >The health authorities confirm the first case of corona in Bremen. The infected person is a woman born in 1962 and is located in the Klinikum Bremen-Mitte, says Lukas Fuhrmann, spokesperson of the health authority: ""The woman is fine, she shows only slight symptoms, she has fever and headache. The sufferer had previously made a trip to Iran, she had come from Iran to Bremen via Frankfurt am Main on Thursday.   >  >""The health department has already identified and informed the woman's contact persons,"" the spokesperson said.  ""The contact persons are mainly from her personal environment, they will now be in domestic quarantine"".  The contact persons have therefore not been moved to special buildings for quarantine, but can stay at home but should not leave their homes.  The quarantine usually lasts for 14 days, said Fuhrmann - that is the incubation period of the virus.  >  >What does this mean for Bremen residents? ""There is no cause for concern"", says the spokesman for the authorities. ""That there would also be a case in Bremen was to be expected."" Bremen citizens should continue to follow the normal rules of hygiene, the health authority recommends. This includes, for example, thorough washing of hands as well as coughing and sneezing not into the hand but into the crook of the arm. There is no increased risk of infection at Bremen airport either, the spokesperson for the health authority emphasizes: ""The woman who fell ill did not travel from Frankfurt to Bremen by plane, but by car. The Frankfurt airport had been informed about the Bremen case.  >  >There is also news about the suspicious cases: For one of two suspicious cases that occurred in Bremen on Friday, the test results are now available: The test is negative, the affected person can leave home quarantine. The result for the second case is still pending.  >  >In the meantime, however, two new suspicious cases have been added in Bremen, according to the health authorities. The two persons and their contact persons are in domestic quarantine. These two new suspected cases are not contact persons of the Bremen woman suffering from Covid-19: ""These two new suspected cases are not related"", according to the spokesperson of the health authority.","First confirmed case in Bremen, Germany (translation in comments)",2020-02-29 10:29:17,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbgr7h/first_confirmed_case_in_bremen_germany/

About 80 labs and private companies have applied for emergency approval for tests they have already created. If they have submitted evidence that the tests work, the labs and companies will be able to use them immediately, rather than wait for the F.D.A. to complete reviews and issue approvals.“This action today reflects our public health commitment to addressing critical public health needs and rapidly responding and adapting to this dynamic and evolving situation,” the F.D.A.’s commissioner, Stephen M. Hahn, said in a statement.Experts have been frustrated with the limited availability of coronavirus tests in the U.S., which until now could only be provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

fj4gfu0,-0.9773,-0.4215,"Care was mandated by the government, but it’s not clear who has to pay.By Sarah KliffFeb. 29, 2020, 12:51 p.m. ET3Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus newsletter.ImageFrank Wucinski and his daughter Annabel in Marine Corps Station Miramar, where they were quarantined after arriving from Wuhan, China.Frank Wucinski and his daughter Annabel in Marine Corps Station Miramar, where they were quarantined after arriving from Wuhan, China.Credit...Courtesy Frank WucinskiFrank Wucinski and his 3-year-old daughter, Annabel, are among the dozens of Americans that the government has flown back to the country from Wuhan, China, and put under quarantine to check for signs of coronavirus.Now they are among what could become a growing number of families hit with surprise medical bills related to government-mandated actions.Mr. Wucinski, a Pennsylvania native who has lived in China for years, accepted the U.S. government’s offer to evacuate from Wuhan with Annabel in early February as the new coronavirus spread. His wife, who is not an American citizen and remains in China, developed pneumonia that doctors think resulted from Covid-19, the disease caused by the respiratory virus. Her father, whom she helped care for, was infected and recently died.The first stop for Mr. Wucinski and Annabel was a two-week quarantine at Marine Corps Station Miramar near San Diego. During that time, they had two mandatory stays in an isolation unit at a nearby children’s hospital. The first started upon arrival in the United States, and the second was a few days later, after an official heard Annabel coughing.“The hospital staff were very nice, they brought us a lot of toys,” Mr. Wucinski said. “Each time it was three or four days. I love my daughter to death, but being in the same room that long, she is not a great conversationalist.”Both have repeatedly tested negative for the virus.After their release from quarantine, Mr. Wucinski and his daughter went to stay with his mother in Harrisburg, Pa. That’s where they found a pile of medical bills waiting: $3,918 in charges from hospital doctors, radiologists and an ambulance company.“I assumed it was all being paid for,” Mr. Wucinski said. “We didn’t have a choice. When the bills showed up it was just a pit in my stomach, like how do I pay for this?”Mr. Wucinski’s employer, a standardized testing company, did provide health benefits when he lived in China but does not offer coverage in the United States.Patients in the United States regularly confront surprise medical bills that are hard to decode. Mr. Wucinski’s case suggests that those held in mandatory isolation for suspected coronavirus may be no exception.The federal government does have the authority to quarantine and isolate patients whom officials believe to be a public health threat. These powers, which date back to cholera outbreaks among ship passengers in the late 19th century, are rarely used. They don’t say anything about who pays when the isolation happens in a nongovernmental medical facility — or when they’re brought there by a private ambulance company.“There is no uniform practice,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. “They do have the powers, but they’ve almost never used them in modern times.”While the number of patients held in mandatory isolation is currently small, it is likely to grow if the coronavirus continues to spread across the United States. Eleven cases were confirmed in San Antonio on Friday evening. Earlier in the day, public health authorities identified a second case in California and a first in Oregon where patients who had not traveled to an affected country became infected.A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman declined to comment on whether it would pay the bills of patients kept in mandatory isolation.Mr. Gostin worries that high charges for mandatory isolation could make patients wary of seeking needed medical treatment.“The most important rule of public health is to gain the cooperation of the population,” he said. “There are legal, moral and public health reasons not to charge the patients.”These hospital stays could prove expensive. The International Federation of Health Plans estimates that the average day in a U.S. hospital costs $4,293, compared with $1,308 in Australia and $481 in Spain. They may be especially costly for patients without health insurance or those who have large deductibles, which they must pay before their health benefits kick in.Mr. Wucinski recalls other patients asking questions about how medical bills would be handled during daily town hall meetings for those quarantined at the Marine Corps station. He felt the answers weren’t clear.He did receive a document upon leaving quarantine, directing him to contact a government email address with any medical bills. He sent an email on Feb. 24 detailing the charges and asking what would be done.“My question, is why are we being charged for these stays, if they were mandatory and we had no choice in the matter?” Mr. Wucinski wrote in his message.His email has not yet received a response, he said. When contacted by The New York Times, a Rady Children’s Hospital spokesman said that the bill from their physicians had been sent in error and that the family would not be held responsible for the charges.“We’re in the process of assessing how the error occurred,” the spokesman, Benjamin Metcalf, said. “We are working with government agencies regarding billing for these cases.”But the hospital bill only represented a fraction of those the family received.The ambulance company that transported the Wucinskis, American Medical Response, charged the family $2,598 for taking them to the hospital. A company representative declined to comment on the bill “due to patient privacy concerns,” but said the company would look into the case.An additional $90 in charges came from radiologists who read the patients’ X-ray scans and do not work for the hospital. Having such doctors, who may be outside a patient’s insurance networks, provide services to hospital patients is one of the major causes of surprise medical bills.The radiologists’ employer, San Diego Medical Imaging Group, did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Wucinski is looking into whether he or his daughter might qualify for Medicaid, the public insurance program that covers low-income Americans. Some news outlets have seized on the fact that he coughed enough on a recent television interview to require water.Mr. Wucinski recently noticed that his daughter is blinking a lot and hopes to get the issue examined by a doctor, but is worried about the charges they may face. He has wondered whether the stress of the past month and the separation from her mother has played a role.“I should take her to the doctor this week for a checkup, but we don’t have insurance, so it’s just going to have to be cash,” he said.Sarah Kliff is an investigative reporter for The New York Times. Her reporting focuses on the American health care system and how it works for patients.","Kept at the Hospital on Coronavirus Fears, Now Facing Large Medical Bills",2020-02-29 12:19:44,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbif55/kept_at_the_hospital_on_coronavirus_fears_now/

So, expect Beijing’s fiscal engineers, municipal governments, central bank policymakers and statisticians to pull out all the stops to create the impression gross domestic product gets as close to this year’s target as humanly possible.When temperatures fall and face masks come off, though, the global economy will confront a China that’s not as healthy and more systemically risky than ever before. The number that matters most isn’t 6%—it’s [34 trillion](https://www.bloombergquint.com/china/china-deleveraging-is-dead-as-34-trillion-debt-habit-roars-back). That’s how much worth of [public and private debt](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-11/china-zeros-in-on-local-hidden-debt-amid-falling-tax-take) in U.S. dollar terms China had as of 2019. This bookend is useful because it marks the price tag from Beijing’s last effort to beat economic gravity.The 10 years between 2009—just after Wall Street crashed—and 2019 saw humankind’s greatest stimulus campaigns. That explosion of multilane highways, international airports, stadiums, city halls, university campuses, five-star hotels and museums kept growth north of 6% and helped the country’s leaders maintain legitimacy.But the coronavirus is loosening the rug beneath the feet of China’s policymakers in two ways. One, a slow and opaque response to an outbreak skirting pandemic status is denting their legacy. Two, it’s piercing the veil of economic inevitability on which Beijing has dined for many years.True, [short sellers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/02/25/dow-plunges-nearly-1900-points-in-two-days-as-coronavirus-rattles-global-markets/#31ba8e3f6031) don’t make tend to make much money betting against China Inc. Yet so-called Minsky moments—when credit-fueled booms go awry—come whether or not you’re ready. Here, think Japan in the 1980s, Latin America, Asia and Russia in the 1990s and the U.S. in 2008. Policymakers can’t easily control the fallout when economies hit a wall.￼The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is pictured on[+]VISUAL CHINA GROUP VIA GETTY IMAGES/VISUAL CHINA GROUP VIA GETTY IMAGESThis doesn’t mean China is going to crash anytime soon. The closed nature of its financial system does indeed afford China’s government a variety of unique shock absorbers—not least of which $3.2 trillion of [foreign exchange reserves](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/foreign-exchange-reserves). There’s no getting around the fact, though, that China’s financial system will end 2020 on weaker footing than it entered it.With half a billion of its citizens on lockdown and supply chains reeling, China probably won’t reach 6% this year. A better reading of the true state of Chinese growth will come from how key trading partners from Japan to South Korea to Australia fare.China’s economy confronts coronavirus risks from a weakened position after 18 months of trade warring. To combat U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Beijing’s fiscal managers and the [People’s Bank of China](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pboc-statement/china-central-bank-says-to-launch-new-measures-to-counter-coronavirus-impact-idUSKCN20I194) swung further toward stimulus mode. That includes allowing regional governments to up borrowings.Expect more of the same in 2020 as China’s outbreak hobbles any number of growth engines. When it comes to the fallout for the most populous nation, economists don’t know what they don’t know.“The direct costs of China’s economy-wide shutdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 are visible in empty streets and shuttered stores,” says analyst Thomas Gatley of Gavekal Research. “But the extent of the second-order impacts is much harder to see: how much of the [economic damage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/upshot/coronavirus-wall-street-analysis.html) wrought by those closures will last even after businesses reopen?”Gatley estimates that Chinese companies collectively will lose around $710 billion in cashflows in the first quarter. “In the face of this huge pressure,” he says, “many firms will have no choice but to default or delay payment on their cash obligations to staff, banks and suppliers, and to curtail their capex plans this year.”Even this, of course, could prove optimistic. If so, the [$1.7 trillion rout](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/coronavirus-wipes-out-1point7-trillion-in-us-stock-market-value-in-two-days.html?__source=facebook%7Cmain&fbclid=IwAR3avxsXkxXIcCLL6F5xu_GV9cMVijae6fuvXpK6rV0-UU6ZBYx1nZGt88Q) U.S. stocks suffered the first two days of this week could be a harbinger of things to come. It’s the risk Trump didn’t consider when tossing sand into China’s export engine: how the economic trauma would boomerang back America’s way.Bad enough China is facing a potential health crisis. Even worse it’s doing so in a weakened position. Global investors have plenty of reasons to worry. Thirty-four trillion, in fact.[William Pesek](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/)I am a Tokyo-based journalist, former columnist for Barron’s and Bloomberg and author of “Japanization: What the World Can Learn from Japan’s Lost Decades.” My journalism…Read More© 2020 Forbes Media LLC.

In fact that is a main reason why they went for the trade war in the first place: to decouple the us and Chinese economies and diversify American supply chain away from China.And they were vindicated by this pandemic.

Those countries with only a few cases for now have the best hope of actually containing it successfully if they really put all they have into it. Just ban flights to and from all the areas with major outbreaks, encourage people to stop travelling abroad if they can (travel agencies in my country started to refund everyone who booked trips to Italy), track down everyone the infected patient has been in contact with or as many as possible and quarantine them all immediately, and implement strict fines for breaching quarantine.Containment really should be possible when the number of cases is still very low, it's just that most countries aren't taking it seriously when it's just a few cases and wait for it to blow up.

fj4n36w,-0.9777,0.5994,"I certainly recommend reading the whole thing. Here is a long TL; DR:The federal government’s quarantine powers at U.S. borders are indeed extensive. The Department of Homeland Security has implemented a travel ban on noncitizens who have been anywhere in China recently. U.S. citizens, by contrast, cannot be turned away at the border, but they can be ordered into quarantine to be monitored, at present for up to two weeks. The secretary of health and human services announced quarantine measures for returning citizens not long after the CDC issued its first federal quarantine order in more than 50 years—for the first planeload of people evacuated from Wuhan by the U.S. State Department. Federal quarantine orders, however, are implemented and enforced by state health authorities, not federal officials. That means state and local health departments provide the labor, set the rules, monitor people who might have been exposed to the virus, and trace the contacts of those who fall ill. This is where the weakness of a federalist system of national health defense is exposed. States may choose to ignore federal quarantine guidelines, or they may decide that more drastic measures are required, such as a lockdown against a neighboring city or region. Extreme measures may be necessary in a public-health emergency, but the variation from one location to another could also make an epidemic worse as each state makes its own rules, looks out for its own interests, and relies on its own resources. Jurisdictional boundaries are enforced, among other reasons, to preserve limited budgets. This unique brand of public-health federalism can make implementing a national strategy in the event of a threatened epidemic very difficult.",Outstanding article on what to expect an emergency response to a disease outbreak in the US to look like.,2020-02-29 13:04:07,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbj1zq/outstanding_article_on_what_to_expect_an/

fj5lnp2,-0.8446,0.5994,"Thank you for the summary.Assuming there are tests and guidelines about what to do, wouldn't local gov. be able to respond faster to an outbreak? They know their population the best. Local government will be able to focused on day to day changes in their communities instead of waiting for a federal bureaucracy. It allowed CA cities and WA to declare a state of emergency and let Mississippi and Iowa etc. to continue with their daily lives. If this becomes wide spread, there are 50 governors and only 1 head of the CDC...Some of them will fall short. BUT in a centralized system, ALL 50 states will tie their future on the judgement of the federal gov. Who is to say that the fed gov. will make the right choice for all of them? What if they make the wrong decision and screw over all 50 states?Every local elected official will have to face their citizens in the next election. What is to prevent a centralized gov. from favoring their political base - republican gov. funding texas and the core or a demo. controlled one funding the coasts?????In fact, the central CCP gov has actually been asking local gov. to make decisions about how to resume economic activity etc. So basically what this article says the American system will be forced to allow...China has a centralized gov.

fj4lt3u,-0.4382,-0.1027,"Professor John Oxford, a virologist from Queen Mary University of London, said: “It’s a question of crystal ball gazing but if you look at other members of the coronavirus family, that are respiratory viruses and we've known about them for the last 50 years or more, they're seasonal.“They're just like the common cold, there's probably a few thousand people infected with them at the moment in England.“Whether Covid-19 will fit into that pattern or not, we will just have to wait and see but my guess is it will . He said it had “enough characteristics” similar to the viruses we've known about for the last 50 years for it to eventually “settle down and become seasonal”.Dr Oxford added that if the virus were seasonal we will begin to see “the figures drop off”.That, coupled with social distancing including not kissing or hugging, and washing hands would buy the industry time to develop antiviral drugs, which he said “can be delivered quite quickly”.“My hope is that this virus will be seasonal and that the coming spring and summer may help us in our battle against the virus and it may have a very significant effect,” he said.“As spring approaches it's not to do with the virus it's to do with us, we do something different in our habits and that makes the virus less transferable and transmittable.”Dr Michael Skinner, Reader in Virology, Imperial College London, said that “we can’t rule out a second wave”.“It could well slow down over the summer but I think most people anticipate that it's likely that it will come back as a second wave. It's common for influenza to talk about one, two, or three waves and even back in 2009 we had two waves there as well.”Dr Skinner said that whilst it was all conjecture, it was “hard to believe it will go away unless everyone has been infected and they are all immune”.  “Therefore a proportion of those who hadn’t been infected the first time round will be infected the second time round.But he said: “The expectation is it would just eventually - and this could take a number of years - settle down much like the ones we regard as normal respiratory infections.“In a few years time I think we will accept it’s there but it may well change and become less of a problem.”","Coronavirus could become seasonal infection that returns each winter, experts warn",2020-02-29 13:19:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbj9ve/coronavirus_could_become_seasonal_infection_that/

Barry writes in his book about that pandemic, “The Great Influenza.” “People were already avoiding each other, turning their heads away if they had to talk, isolating themselves. The telephone company increased the isolation: With 1,800 telephone company operators out, the phone company allowed only emergency calls.”Sports events were canceled. Theaters closed. Shaking hands was made illegal in Prescott, Ariz. Philadelphia hurriedly set up six more morgues. Families put crepe paper on doorways to signal a death inside — and crepe was everywhere.That Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, which killed at least 50 million people worldwide, has been the benchmark for pandemics ever since. For decades public health experts have called for preparations for another “big one” — yet adequate preparations were never made.Nobody knows if the coronavirus will be a “big one,” for it may still fizzle. As of this writing, only one person is known to have died from it in the United States, while thousands routinely die annually from the seasonal flu. But increasingly, experts are saying that we should get ready just in case.“Are we seeing a replay of 1918?” asked The New England Journal of Medicine, a publication not associated with alarmism. Bill Gates, who for years has been warning presciently about the danger of pandemics, bluntly cautions that this virus could be a “once-in-a-century pandemic.”“I hope it’s not that bad, but we should assume that it will be until we know otherwise,” Gates said, and that seems prudent.While figures are uncertain, the coronavirus may kill 2 percent of those infected; if correct, that would be similar to the lethality of the 1918 flu (it’s also possible that many more people are infected without significant symptoms, which would make the death rate quite a bit lower). Another similarity with 1918 is that the United States and the world are unready for a pandemic.“We’re amazingly unprepared,” Dr. Irwin Redlener, a Columbia University professor and director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness, told me.President Trump exaggerates threats from caravans of migrants or from a hobbled Iran, and he has diverted billions of dollars from the military to build a border wall that smugglers hack apart with $100 saws. But he has not been attuned to pandemic threats: In 2018 the White House removed the position on the National Security Council to fight pandemics, while seeking to scale back anti-pandemic work to about 10 countries from 49. Experts warned at the time that this was dangerously shortsighted.At a time when we need wise, scientifically informed leadership, we find ourselves with a president with little credibility and an antagonistic relationship with scientists. It doesn’t help that during the Ebola crisis of 2014, Trump was one of the most fiery critics of evidence-driven policies that actually succeeded in ending the outbreak.The United States is also vulnerable because of longstanding deficiencies in our health care system. We are the only major rich country without universal health insurance and paid sick leave, and we have fewer doctors per capita than peer countries.Consider a Florida man, Osmel Martinez Azcue, who returned from China and found himself becoming sick. As The Miami Herald reported, he might normally have gone to a drugstore and bought over-the-counter flu medicine. But because of the risk of coronavirus he did the responsible thing and sought medical attention: He went to a hospital for testing. In the end, it turned out not to be coronavirus — but he was billed $3,270.We must ensure that no one is deterred from seeking help by the costs. The White House and Congress should immediately establish a system to ensure that patients need not pay for coronavirus testing and treatment. We should also ensure paid sick leave. Do we really want to go to a restaurant where a coughing, sneezing food preparer still goes to work out of financial need?William A. Haseltine, president of a think tank called Access Health International, told me that a vaccine might take at least six to eight months to develop and test — some other estimates are longer — and this should involve an immediate federal investment through Project BioShield. We also need better diagnostics and treatment as well as more ventilators to keep people alive.Dr. Peter Jay Hotez, an expert on global health at Baylor University, emphasized to me the need to support front-line health workers and keep them from becoming infected.“If we see a situation in the U.S. like we saw in Wuhan — more than 1,000 cases among hospital workers and five or six deaths — it’s game over,” he said. “Health workers lose confidence, and things start to fall apart.”Hotez said that one crucial step is simply ensuring that all health workers have enough personal protective equipment.We may also have to think about reducing occasions when people are crowded together; that may mean more people working from home to avoid offices, buses and subways. It may mean avoiding sports events, school assemblies, parties and even unnecessary visits to crowded doctor’s offices — this is a time to develop telemedicine.I have two family graduations this spring, and who knows if they will take place? Experts can’t answer the questions that we all have, but they say that we will get through better if we make preparations while relying on science and evidence rather than on muddled political leaders trying to talk up markets or score political points.The legendary Joshua Lederberg, a geneticist and Nobel Prize laureate, once said that in the struggle against new diseases, “It’s our wits versus their genes.” If we want our wits to triumph, we will need to think clearly, prepare for the worst — and do better.","Opinion: Is This Coronavirus ‘the Big One’?

fj4wqzo,-0.6895,0.2023,"I just posted this in another thread, but probably more relevant here. There's an interesting article from the BBC: ""Coronavirus: What are the chances of dying?""[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51674743](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51674743)It confirms what many of us have known for a while. Mortality is highest for those who are most at risk, specifically1. Aged 60+ (around 4%) increasing to 15% mortality for those aged 80+2. Those with cardiovascular disease (11%)3. Those with diabetes or hypertension (7%)The bar chart is not easy to read, but the above are my estimations of the mortality rates as illustrated within the article.This explains in part why Italy, Japan, South Korea are all so badly affected. They have an old population. 27% of Japanese are aged 65+ and 23% of Italians are aged 65+. These are the two countries with the oldest age profile in the world (according to Wiki).If the above mortality rates hold true, this is going to seriously affect muslim and middle eastern countries too. Not because they have older population, but for a different reason: they have high diabetes rates, affecting about 20% of the population. This includes Sudan, Saudi Arabia, UEA, Qatar, Bahrain etc. If 20% of your population has diabetes, say if even only 50% get COVID-19 and the 7% mortality rate holds true, we are talking hundreds of thousands of people. Even Iran has 10% diabetes rates across its population. Expect Coronavirus to be particularly deadly there. Countries with high prevelance of cardiovascular disease should also be concerned about Coronavirus. But I couldn't find any stats on which countries have high cardiovascular diseases (feel free to suggest in coments?).So it's all well and fine for people to keep saying ""its just like the flu"" and it has low mortality rate of between 0.7% and 2% but that's evidently not going to be the case for a whole swathe of the world population. Different countries are going to have completely different mortality rates.And we don't even know how this affects those who are chronically malnourished and/or dehydrated - which is a big chunk of the developing world - think subsaharan Africa, or other poorer parts of the world. We don't know what mortality rates in slum settings look like (think Kibera in Kenya, Dharavi in India, or favelas in latin countries) - so far the affected countries have been developed or middle income countries.Based on this, I am guessing (and it is an entirely uneducated, lay persons guess), that the following parts of the world are going to be worst affected:1. Countries with older populations: Japan, Italy, Portugal, Germany, Bulgaria etc.2. Countries with high diabetes rates: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Pakistan, Malaysia (basically most of the Muslim world)3. Least developed countries, with high prevalence of malnutrition and particularly those with large urban centres. Think Nigeria, Ethiopia, DRC, Tanzania, Bangladesh and slums of India, Brazil, Indonesia etc.Strap in folks, we really know very little about what the next chapter is.

I'm not surprised they've failed miserably at ramping up testing. In contrast, South Korea is doing drive through tests with 10s of thousands anticipated. This is a brilliant response by minimizing contact between the infected and uninfected. Asian responses have been outstanding, with the exception of Japan's handling of the cruise ship.

The country has nearly 600 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including seven government officials and at least five members of Parliament.A scene in Tehran on Saturday. The country has Over the past week, Iran reported that seven government officials, including one of the country’s vice presidents, were infected. The country’s president, Hassan Rouhani, attended a meeting last week with at least one of them.Also infected is the son of a prominent politician who advises Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The son, Faridedin Hadad Adel, who is also related to the ayatollah by marriage, tweeted that he had gotten the virus after visiting a school in the holy city of Qom, which is an epicenter of the virus in Iran.State media reported that an Iranian parliament member had died from respiratory failure after being admitted to a hospital with flulike symptoms, raising questions about whether that was also a coronavirus case. The member, Mohamad Ali Ramezani,  was from Gilan Province, which has emerged as a second epicenter of the epidemic within Iran, after Qom.The outbreak has brought life to a standstill in Iran. Officials have temporarily shut down schools, universities and canceled all public gatherings, according to state media.Masoumeh Aghapour Alishahi, one of the parliamentarians who has tested positive, released a video message asking Mr. Rouhani to shut down all education centers until the crisis is contained.The Center of Human Rights in Iran, a research and advocacy group based in the United States, has expressed concerns over reports that prisoners in the country are not being protected from the virus and lack access to medicine, hygiene and sanitary products.Asadollah Abbasi, a member of Parliament who acts as the body’s spokesman, was quoted in state media as saying that the five positive cases had emerged from testing 100 lawmakers. He said other lawmakers would be tested in their own hometowns or in the capital, Tehran. Iran’s Parliament has 290 representatives.The country’s death toll rose to 43 from 34 on Friday and the number of infected was up to 593 from 388,  according to officials cited in state media. Health experts have said that multiplying each death by 50 is offers a rough estimate of the true number of cases, and experts say the real number of cases is likely much higher than what is being reported.","Iran: 210 dead, 388 infected? ...That's a 54% mortality rate.

It’s the ones that might pop up in the community who have been travelling, like it happened in Queensland where someone came back from Iran, had no symptoms at the time they arrived, and now we possibly have some escape of the virus into the community because of that.""That’s the way it’s likely to pop up in West Australia.""It’s likely it’ll be someone who has come from a country where they don’t know necessarily they have been exposed to the virus, they have no symptoms, they go about their business and that’s where it’s going to pop up eventually.""We need to understand what’s the next wave and how is it going to be complemented with setting up dedicated facilities. If we see lots of patients present, they can’t be going to general practice and turning up in large numbers, they need to be going to fever clinics.""Dr Miller said he had concerns that a coronavirus outbreak could hit WA at the same time as the usual flu season and that this would ""complicate matters"" when it came to diagnosing the virus.He suggested people prepare to get vaccinated for influenza, even if they had never done so previously, with a specific vaccine for coronavirus likely to still be ""months away"".Also on Sunday, the WA Shadow Health Minister Zak Kirkup ""implored"" the state government to start a ""widespread public information and advertising campaign in relation to the coronavirus disease"".""This campaign should inform Western Australians as to how we can best prepare for, prevent and respond to any potential outbreak if it does eventuate.""The public should also be fully informed about how our health system is preparing to respond to any coronavirus cases, and who people can turn to if they are worried that they may be infected.""","WA Medical Chief: Australian's need to prepare ""very seriously"", ""have a plan and think about those most vulnerable around them"".

Lymphopenia was very common, and in severe cases was seen in more than 85% of patients.4. Thrombocytopenia was seen in some cases, but even in severe disease was mild.5. CRP was elevated in most severe cases (\~80%).6. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were uncommon symptoms7. The virus can be detected in the gastrointestinal tract, saliva, and urine.

That means there may have been 42/7 = 6 generations of infectionLet’s see how many cases there would be with different R0 values:R0 of 2 = 2^6 = 64R0 of 3 = 3^6 = 729R0 of 4 = 4^6 = 4096Caveat: I’m no expert - just playing with numbers.Edit: going to take the R0 of 3 because anything higher is terrifying to contemplateWith R0 of 3 and fatality rate of 2%, there would have been 3^6 * 2% = 14 excess deaths in the region over the last 6 weeks from the virus. Moving forward another generation (7 days) you would see 3^7 * 2% = 43 deaths. 43-14 = 29 deaths over next week assuming R0 stays unchecked. Jesus.

After heroic medical efforts patient was saved and tested negative on multiple PCR tests. However his lungs have already suffered irreversible damage in the progress.On 29/02/2020, under the approval of Jiangsu Health Commission it was decided to allocate special resources to try to save this patient. The donated lungs came from a donor from outside the province, delivered by high speed rail directly to Wuxi in seven hours. After the transplant the patient is now conscious and the lungs are oxygenating the blood well, all life signs stable.Chen Jing Yu says such lung transplants require three conditions to be worth while:1. Patient has under went mechanical ventilation and ECMO, suffering irreversible lung damage from the infection2. Multiple PCR test showing negative result and thus recovery3. All other organs show no damage, patient body overall seem capable of sustaining transplanted lungs.""This is a highly risky operation, it must be performed in a negative pressure operating theatre, all medical staff need to be suited in PPE. This is a test of both physical and mental will."" according to Chen Jing Yu. ""To ensure both the success of the transplant as well as zero infection among the staff we did a lot of planning and preparation work. The next step will be for us to closely monitor the patient with a view on figuring out what sort of post surgery care such transplants require so that our experience could be used to save more critical condition patients in the future.""","Wuxi, Jiangsu - first successful double lung transplant post COVID-19",2020-02-29 21:37:27,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbpn9v/wuxi_jiangsu_first_successful_double_lung/

Coronivirus is not getting in the water system.Typically, pumps pull water from deep wells in the ground. Then they are chlorinated with either gas or liquid. The pumps pressurize the system to fill storage tanks. Water is drawn from the pressurized mains. It's an autonomous system that simply needs to be monitored. If the power goes out, there is emergency standby back up power if needed. Pumps do not run full time. No concern here...I'm more concerned about wastewater treatment plants.

fj5xb32,-0.9656,-0.3612,"This is an issue in child care/education.  A lot of the blame falls to the school administration for allowing these behaviors of repeatedly sending children in sick and violating/not enforcing school policies.  It is so common for parents to basically dope their kids on medications that reduce fevers or mask symptoms for the first hour or so after taking them.  That gets the kids in the door and gives the parents enough time to basically hide.  So often they don’t show up for HOURS after they’ve been called.  This is absolutely unacceptable for ailments like strep, the flu, or even a nasty cold.  This should be criminal dealing with the coronavirus.  I live in the states and we live in a very backwards land where employers can’t seem to understand that their employees are living beings with families and so missing work is often times detrimental.  There need to be labor laws in place to protect employees when it comes to taking care of sick or injured children.  There aren’t any unless it’s a ridiculously long medical leave.  Because of this many parents have to send their sick children out of necessity.  There are, however, an equal or even greater number of parents that dont.  I’ve worked in early childhood education and early elementary education.  It was my experience that the parents that stayed home or could work remotely were the worst offenders.  I’m not unsympathetic to the plight of balancing a job and children.  There is very little wiggle room when it comes to being reckless with public safety.  Most schools already have these policies in place that could protect them from inconsiderate and cavalier parents they need only to enforce them.  The best motivator is always monetary- slapping them with fines, suspensions, and expulsions earlier with less severe illnesses would have given us a greater leg up in containing this disaster.If there is one thing kids are great about sharing, it is their germs.","Coronavirus: Parents ignore self-quarantine advice, send children to school",2020-02-29 21:46:31,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbpqq7/coronavirus_parents_ignore_selfquarantine_advice/

About 40,000 Wuhan-ese flew to Thailand during Chinese New Year and lots of people work/live between southern China and Thailand, so they would have had quite a few people with the illness commute into Thailand (for comparison, 10,000 flew to Singapore)2. They then discovered less patients than Singapore?3. In their favour, it is hot and humid there and so the R0 should be lower than colder, dryer places4. However, it should at least be approximate to Singapore cases.5. We know tourism is extremely important to Thailand, and lately they have been following Beijing's instructions on geopolitics, so they are incentivized to play down the impactThe trouble I have with the press release is how do they classify Persons Under Investigation?

fj5w3x0,0.0516,0.0," A man in his 50s, who is understood to be a NSW medical officer, could be the first Australian to get coronavirus through person-to-person transmission if pathology tests show he has contracted the disease.It is believed the worker, who is currently being treated in NSW hospital in intensive care, travelled to China some months ago but only recently started showing symptoms of COVID-19.A NSW Health spokeswoman would not confirm the man’s position or whether he was involved in treating COVID-19 patients.“Regarding the man in his 50s who is being investigated for possible COVID-19, additional specimens were collected overnight and are being tested today to confirm whether or not he has the infection,” a spokeswoman said.“He is currently being cared for in hospital. No more personal details relating to this patient will be released at this stage.”Health authorities say COVID-19 is highly transmissible, particularly among the elderly, however as yet there no cases yet of person-to-person transmission within the Australian community.Earlier today, NSW Health issued a statement saying a man in his 50s was “under investigation for possible COVID-19 based on preliminary laboratory results”.It said the local Public Health Unit was following up on contacts of the possible case “as a precaution” in addition to chasing contacts of the latest confirmed case.","AUSTRALIA: A NSW Medical Officer in a Sydney ICU unit is being tested for Coronavirus.

However, Saturday’s announcement made no mention of Japan.The United States, which has barred the entry of foreign nationals who have been in mainland China within the past 14 days, will extend the ban from Monday to include foreign nationals who have visited Iran within the last 14 days.Concerns are growing that the United States may also see a major outbreak of the pneumonia-causing virus, with infection cases without a known source of exposure emerging in the country. Health officials announced the same day the first reported death in the United States from COVID-19, the official name of the disease caused by the virus.President Donald Trump emphasized in a news conference that the United States is prepared for “any circumstance” and that there is “no reason to panic at all.”",Japan escapes tougher travel measures as U.S. bans entry of travelers from Iran and raises South Korea alert level,2020-02-29 23:48:48,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbqvtn/japan_escapes_tougher_travel_measures_as_us_bans/

fj5zajg,0.9362,-0.1779,"Baseball stadiums, amusement parks and many other popular spots in Japan were mostly empty Saturday following the government's request earlier this week to operators of sports and entertainment venues to consider canceling or postponing mass gatherings to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.Professional baseball games, usually associated with fans cheering and singing in unison at packed stadiums, were played without spectators across the country as Nippon Professional Baseball decided Wednesday to hold all 72 of its remaining preseason games behind closed doors.At Zozo Marine Stadium, the Lotte Marines' Seiya Inoue homered against the Rakuten Eagles and circled the bases in silence. ""It's sad that nobody is watching,"" he said after going ahead with his routine home-run celebration performance.""It's for the safety of our fans. It can't be helped,"" said Kimiyasu Kudo, manager of the SoftBank Hawks in the Pacific League.League.It is the first time NPB has barred fans from attending preseason or regular season games, although after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, practice games before that season's delayed start were closed to the public.""Players can do well partly because they're playing in front of fans. By contrast, (playing at an empty venue) will allow them to appreciate fans even more,"" said Akihiro Yano, skipper of the Central League's Hanshin Tigers. ""I think this will be a good experience for them.""There were also few signs of life in many other places along the Japanese archipelago. Tokyo Disneyland and Universal Studios Japan, popular theme parks that usually draw ample crowds on weekends, were closed from Saturday to March 15 in line with the government's request Wednesday to cancel or put off big events for two weeks.The numbers of people were sparse at nearby shops and train stations, with amusement park staffers wearing face masks explaining to tourists how to get refunds for tickets or informing visitors about the closures.Some visited USJ in Osaka anyway because they had planned the trip before the closure announcement. ""I wanted to take at least a photo,"" said a 20-year-old university student who traveled to the park from Beppu in Oita Prefecture with friends.In Hokkaido, the country's northernmost main island where a state of emergency was declared Friday, fish markets, commercial facilities and tourist spots were deserted, while department stores and restaurant chains cut their business hours.At Nijo Market, where displays of the day's catch are popular with tourists, restaurant employee Daisuke Tanaka, said, ""There aren't any customers. Normally, tourists come here for bowls of fresh fish on rice.""Kiyotaka Ohashi, a seafood shop employee, said, ""I reduced purchases because I expected fewer customers.""At least 70 infections, including two deaths, have been confirmed in Hokkaido, the largest among the country's 47 prefectures, prompting the governor to ask residents to remain indoors over the weekend.At Ueno in Tokyo, where a number of museums and other cultural facilities are located, some visitors were surprised at the closures.""I understand that mass events are canceled but I didn't expect that even the National Museum of Nature and Science would also be shut,"" said Eiji Ono, a company employee from Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture.Tokyo Girls Collection, a major fashion show, also went ahead without spectators, in the Japanese capital. The show, including models on the catwalk, was livestreamed instead.Meanwhile, horses raced in front of empty stands at three racecourses. At Nakayama Racecourse in Funabashi, near Tokyo, a few fans went to the venue in the morning without knowing they could not enter, the Japan Racing Association said.""It was awkward when we passed by (an empty) paddock, but it felt like any other race, except for not hearing fans cheer in the final dash,"" said jockey Genki Maruyama, who won the first race at Nakayama.",[Japan] Popular spots all over the country emptied by coronavirus fears,2020-02-29 23:51:58,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbqwrc/japan_popular_spots_all_over_the_country_emptied/
