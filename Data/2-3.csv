fgffy3k,0.9287,-0.3129,"I look at it a little differently.  I think the rebellious and skeptical nature of reddit is a good thing.  MSM sometimes lets us down.  News use to be reported with ‘both sides’. Good luck finding a news program that shows you the ‘for’ and ‘against’ for every issue they present.  In a way, Reddit has this open source, real-time peer review culture.  It should be embraced. Civilized back and forth postulation should be encouraged.  I love reading everyone’s ideas, even the ones that I believe are completely off the wall.  It only tells me this forum isn’t heavily censured. Which is reassuring.","Am I the only one who is not annoyed with people asking questions? This is a new virus. People are learning, and should feel comfortable to ask.

fgff9t7,-0.8402,-0.3129,"In a public forum like this you are going to hear many viewpoints. 90% are going to fall into a reasonable viewpoint, ask poignant and salient questions and be helpful and answer those questions. 10% are going to be ridiculous questions and people being assholes answering (any) questions. It's the 10% that stick in your head. Especially if those 10% disagree with your view. The problem is, what constitutes the 10% of minority assholes in my world-view is probably different than your 10%.So tl;dr the internet makes the loud minority seem much larger than it really is.","Am I the only one who is not annoyed with people asking questions?

fgfh3ze,-0.8299,0.3885,"I mean most of the answers to your questions would maybe( except the one about just letting yourself get sick which the answer to that one is probably no). I mean people who probably more highly educated than myself could give the facts pointing one way or the another.For example the infection rate does seem to be going up a lot day by day however china from I've looked at has quite a densely packed and large population meaning the numbers of infection rate can seem a lot worse than it actually is due to people taking confirmed(and non-confirmed) cases and looking at them sometimes without comparing them to size of the population (china's population is around 1.386 billion and there are 17,300 confirmed cases and 361 confirmed deaths within the country from what I've seen at this time and most of the deaths were elderly or had pre-existing conditions).However the Chinese government could be lying about the total confirmed cases and deaths (and would be horrifical and reckless stupid if doing so) and the total number of infections and deaths could be higher than we know and it is suspected that confirmed cases are lower than how many actual cases there are regardless of china lying or not.Two other things to think about is that American media from I've seen as a Brit comes across as very misleading and tends to make things seem way worse than they are (basing this on how the American media mostly treated Ebola like it would bring the apocalypse down upon everyone) and second be cautious, research if you wish but don't panic, panicking helps no one and tends cause more issues than it solves.In short, don't panic , look stuff up and come to your own conclusions and don't listening blindly to doomsayers or people who say nothing but don't panic.edit: fixing typos",I genuinely HOPE that they are right and we are all just paranoid.,2020-02-03 01:00:17,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ey4ca5/i_genuinely_hope_that_they_are_right_and_we_are/

fgf8om7,0.6657,0.0,"Can we please have a historical graph. At the moment the data essentially just gives a snapshot in time but that's not very useful for identifying what those figures might mean in the bigger picture. These figures don't even tell us the change since yesterday so then we have to try and hunt those figures down elsewhere. Just really wish there was one place I could go to give me all the data. Some useful data:1. What is the daily growth as a percentage, both today and for every day since the outbreak? This shows if it is accelerating, decelerating or stable.2. How do the growth rate figures compare when broken down in to these regions:a) Wuhanb) Chinac) China excluding Wuhand) The world, excluding China.This website goes some way to showing historical data but it doesn't break it down in to regions:[https://www.coronavirusdata.org/trending-ncov-confirmed-cases/](https://www.coronavirusdata.org/trending-ncov-confirmed-cases/)Since this outbreak will be in different stages of growth in the above regions, it may be useful to see how they compare.3) Break down historical data by official infections and deaths. The above graph only gives historical infections but not deaths. So I don't know what the percentage growth rate is for deaths. That's another critical piece of data to identify the progress of the virus. Since many commentors are stating the official infected figures are wrong because the authorities can't test everyone due to lack of kits, well then the deaths must be more accurate as you don't need a test kit to identify if someone's died but they will have known by then if they were infected.&#x200B;Edit: just saw the comment about upcoming graphs.",Our official website is up: https://ncov2019.live/data - Check it out!,2020-02-03 03:21:57,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ey5qhb/our_official_website_is_up_httpsncov2019livedata/

I’ve pulled out of two international business trips which are due to take place in the next 3 weeks, as I don’t want to take any unnecessary chances - I think we in the West are several weeks behind China, in terms of true scale and infection numbers (especially as the incubation period is thought to be 5-14 days). The fact that an asymptomatic carrier is able to infect others with this virus, which is also highly contagious, is the most concerning thing for me right now - we have no idea how many people this has actually affected yet. At the risk of damaging my professional reputation, I’m more than happy to avoid busy airports and flights until we know what the situation is.

Secondly, if you read any reputable medical news outlet on this virus then they have said multiple times that surgical masks are pretty much useless and many times cause the virus to spread more. The reason behind this is people think they are safer than they are with masks and touch their face at an increased rate than when they don’t have a mask. They also tend to leave their mask around, touch the outside and then touch their face. The only effective mask is the N95. Surgical masks have no effect protecting you because they still allow particles inside and like the commentator said, just increase your risk.","""We are basically at a pandemic now"" Dr Gregory Poland of Vaccine Research Group at Mayo Clinic.",2020-02-03 07:50:43,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ey91de/we_are_basically_at_a_pandemic_now_dr_gregory/

fgfw6w9,-0.9974,-0.3818,"To some degree, I agree. But, while I do think 19-nCov should be taken seriously (and there are some characteristics that make it look dangerous, the number of cases and deaths is rising faster than with SARS and with the Swine flu), I also think that with a large probability, it won't be a very large global catastrophe. It is, of course, very bad for Hubei and quite bad for China, but for most of the rest of the world, in the end, it may also seem like one of these cases that will be seen as not so significant in the end. This is not a definitive prediction, of course, it still could spread massively outside China. With some probability, it will really be a big global catastrophe. But with a big, probably bigger likelihood, it will develop in a way that people in many parts of the world will see also 19-nCov as an instance of ""crying wolf"" where there was no real wolf.There will be more epidemics, perhaps most won't be a big threat to most of the world, but there could be a really large pandemic that is a big threat to humanity. So, the many instances where epidemics could be contained and in the end did not claim so many victims (often much fewer than the seasonal flu) should not distract people from the fact that a pandemic is one of the big potential threats to humanity.I think one of the big problems is that people have problems with exponential growth. What is threatening about a new epidemic is not so much the absolute number of cases that can be seen in the beginning - that is usually quite small -, but the potential of growing very large very quickly.It is a dilemma. In the next year, we will probably see more epidemics with different characteristics, and most of them won't be so terrible overall. But we should always be alert because sooner or later there can be a really large pandemic that is a threat to humanity.",The boy who cried wolf,2020-02-03 08:12:04,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ey9cuf/the_boy_who_cried_wolf/

That's the perfect storm for a pandemic, which is seemingly where we're headed. 2-3 percent death rates for a pandemic of millions is not good (this may die down during summer, but it will move to the southern hemisphere for their winter), for families, supplies, or for economies.

fgje758,0.564,0.0,"Yes, but we need to remember that this isn’t all or nothing. The amount of virus particles on a surface won’t go from 100 to 0 as soon as it changes from 4 to 5 days. There is a slow decline in viable virus particles over time. So, say we’re talking about clothes which definitely has a much smaller viable time frame then what’s listed here. I’m just guessing all these numbers for an example, but let’s say 2 days. Say you get coughed no and have 100 virus particles on your pants. Within hours this number is going to decrease. Within a day you might only have 20. By 2 days you have 0. This is important to real ember because it takes more than 1 virus particle to make you sick, and usually the amount of virus particles you ingest is related to the severity of your illness. So be cautious and sanitize, wear masks, self quarantine etc, but remember that these values are the time it takes the virus particles to reach 0 in an ideal surface in a lab. This surface would almost never exist outside of a lab environment so this is the absolute max time it will survive anywhere.",The #coronavirus can survive for five days maximum on smooth surfaces under suitable circumstances: experts from China's Health Commission,2020-02-03 10:41:54,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eybm3v/the_coronavirus_can_survive_for_five_days_maximum/
fgjdiur,-0.9712,0.0,"I mean yes, but also no. If you’re sick and wearing a mask and wash your hands or use hand sanitizer and touch that Doorknob you won’t infect anyone because  there’s nothing to pass on.I get that we’re all scared but this is a non living virus. It’s not some enemy free floating out to kill us. We just need to remember germ theory and sanitize, especially if we are sick. It doesn’t grow on surfaces and we need to remember that these time limits that we’re being given aren’t all or nothing. It’s not like it goes from 100 to 0 as soon as it goes from 4 to 5 days. The number of viable viruses on a surface decreases slowly over time. Say there are 100 viable particles on the doorknob as soon as you touch it. 10 hours later there might only be 80. 3 days later only 10, finally reaching 0 at day 5. This is important to realize because ingesting 1 virus particle isn’t going to make you sick. Most viruses require you to ingest 100s of particles, and often the severity of the illness is related to how much you ingest. So just taking precautions to not get infected could mean that if you get sick you will ingest less and therefore have milder illness.Edit: I’m not saying we shouldn’t self quarantine! We absolutely should. I’m just reminding people that this is a non living virus and germ theory is crucial to remember.

Obviously, people don't generally die immediately, and if the current number of deaths is compared with the number of confirmed infections about a week ago, we get same insanely high estimates of the fatality rate.All the arguments mentioned by the poster are valid for assuming that the real fatality rate is much below these insanely high estimates.But it would be wrong to start with that flawed calculation - dividing current deaths by the number of current infections and then on top of that to assume that the real fatality rate must be even lower.Just using the arguments (mainly in connection with many infections that have not been detected) for stating that the real fatality rate is probably much lower than the very high estimates we get by theoretically good methods with the wrong assumption that we know all infections. But much lower than very high does not tell us very much, and that is the current state of knowledge.It would certainly not correct to claim that there is evidence that the fatality rate is below 2% with a very high likelihood.",You cannot determine the mortality rate of a virus at the beginning of an outbreak.

Like you pointed out, you google 'coronavirus updates' and get articles that were dated from 2 or 3 days ago - it's been about 6 days now that ""NYC is investigating possible Coronavirus cases"" - but absolutely no updates. Even try googling reddit coronavirus, and this link doesn't even show up. everything gets filtered to WHO information on the virus. It is absolutely clear that governments worldwide are trying to censor information bc fear over the pandemic is tanking the global economy and making everyone panic. I'm a student at a university in CT. All the Chinese students (we have a larger chinese population) are walking around with masks on - the Chinese establishments in town are deserted, with the staff even wearing masks. I mean, good for them if they think it helps - but it's clearly not welcoming for us to go into a Chinese restaurant when everyone behind the counter is wearing masks - wtf. This is clearly a bigger issue than any government wants to let their people know about, and like the OP points out - it's obvious when you google 'coronavirus updates' and all that pops up is something from CNN dated 2 or 3 days ago, as if it's old news. This is intentional. They aren't reporting what's going on. In reality, it's highly contagious, and there are many more cases than what's being reported. China itself is infamous for censoring. And the US media is also selling propaganda about ""china building hospitals in 10 days"" - they're showing fake footage and fake images of what the hospitals actually look like. it's a mess, and meanwhile everyone is supposed to stay calm and act like 'there's no way' it could be a prevalent issue here. there are 1000 students at my uni from China -  Wuhan is a massive city, the disease is contagious even in the incubation period, and not everyone shows symptoms...is it really all that paranoid to not want to visit Chinese establishments, when I see Chinese students themselves walking out of restaurants wearing masks or at least carrying N95's in their hand...I don't think so. Something is definitely up, and it's clear that Google's censorship at this point is on par with communist China. There is no more free flow of information on the internet.

Being prepared is important but don't lose your mind in the process.Advice I have is if you're not sure how to prepare then look at a hurricane preparedness checklist because this can help for the majority of what you need.",I think we will see an explosion of cases in the USA within the next 2 weeks,2020-02-03 14:05:42,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eyexq2/i_think_we_will_see_an_explosion_of_cases_in_the/

fgi9ati,0.9076,-0.0286,"I don't know for a fact how many crematoriums are Wuhan, but I saw a very good summary on this exact subject last week and took notes from it. I can't find the Chinese video from about a week ago, so if anyone has the link, please post it! I'm taking this on recollection and the notes I made at the time, so bear with me. AND keep in mind that this was from early last week.In the video the guy said that Wuhan has 7 crematoriums (I haven't been able to find a source on that) and if the mortality rate is \~2% (official) of the virus then we can use that as a baseline.The normal death rate should be somewhere around 0.5-0.7% of natural causes (I don't recall if it was .5 or .7 but it should be possible to substantiate) So if the city is 10m people, then around 50-70 000 people are dying pr. year naturally. Divide this by 365 and we get an average of around 200 deaths pr. day. 200 divided by 7 is \~28 bodies pr. crematorium. Furthermore, if we then check how long it takes to burn a body (I read that it's usually 1.2 to 3.5 hours) and we have an idea of what the normal operating hours of the crematorium is, which has been said to be 4 hours of burning pr. day to dispose of these 28 bodies, meaning they should have around 7 ovens pr. crematorium (I'm assuming, but seems plausible). And we know that they're now going at 4-6 times the normal average rate if they are now going 24/7.This means around 800-1000 minus 200 from natural causes, giving us 600-800 of the virus. At the time guy in the video stated that since the official CCP rate was 2% and that we could divide 600-1000 by 2% and see that the actual number (back then) was 25-50 000 in Wuhan alone of KNOWN cases. This did not account for the unknown, which could probably be twice that, and which fits very well with the earlier Doctors and Nurses statements of 100k (for which they were being prosecuted for saying)He also said something about the infection rate being 1% and that out of the 5 million who left the city prior to quarantine, and went who knows where, around 50 000 were infected...Again, if anyone has the video, please link it.Edit: found a (supposed) map of crematoriums in wuhan.

The student supposedly died from bacterial meningitis (still tragic) but she was not in China recently and there is no reason at all to believe it was nCOV. As of January 26th, I know she was in good health so that would’ve been one hell of a progression in an otherwise healthy student. They also are not allowed to release any information about cause of death until the autopsy report comes out in the coming days. I’m concerned too, especially if it’s meningitis, but as I said, it was not a case of nCOV. I really hope the report is released soon because currently the rumors are spreading like wildfire and I know the community (myself included) is concerned. That being said, universities ARE going to have to be especially diligent with this. The “freshman plague” is common and pervasive every year! They are a huge breeding ground for contagious illnesses :/Edit: I have connections to people who were close with the student in question.","Potential Corona Virus Case at Cornell University Ithaca, NY",2020-02-03 16:34:13,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eyh6tl/potential_corona_virus_case_at_cornell_university/

In PA I start my seeds in the ground early April for a June harvest and then seed again in late July for a fall harvest. Lettuces are prone to small mammal pests and bugs so I grow those inside all year. Tomatoes are good but there is a lot of blight issues in my area of PA. I have to use a copper fungicide fairly regularly to keep it at bay. My favorite are potatoes in containers. The yield I get is amazing and they store well. Also squash stores well and is great for soups, mash and roasted. Peppers, all kinds do well in our hot ass summers. Peppers and tomatoes like hot feet, so a black breathable landscape cover helps keep weeds at bay and also keep the soil nice and hot. Herbs I do in containers all over the place. I also utilize grow bags for different crops and hang in my fence. Also lots of flowers for the pollinators. Pumpkins, squash and cucumber do amazing but get out of hand fast.

fghx871,-0.978,-0.7964,"My experience with this..I got the flu shot the first week of January I developed flu symptoms rapidly on Friday evening 2020-01-31. Dry unproductive cough, lower back and abdominal pain. General muscle soreness. Fever. Steadily rising resting heart rate to over 100.Overnight fever would get as high as 105 but has been managed by taking acetaminophen every 6 hours. 2020-02-01 I barely ate anything. No appetite. And also had no bowel movements. On Sunday 2020-02-02 I realized I have to eat to get well or else I will be weakened as body devours muscle for protein. A slightly sore throat was getting worse but I consume about 800 calories. Monday 2020-02-03 I decide I will goto urgent care and have test for strep throat as my lymph nodes swollen and painful to swallow acetaminophen. They test for strep. As well as flu. Both negative.  They take chest xray to look for bronchial pneumonia. Also negative. Still because it really looks like strep they prescribe antibiotics for it, and tell me if things worsen that I should goto ER.Whatever I have is not flu. Doubt that its coronavirus but cant rule it out with a window of up to 10 day asymptomatic. My travels take me to DC/MD/VA area. My goal is to recover from whatever I have now and avoid any unnecessary exposure to people that may have it.","North America sees waves of the Flu all the time.

fgird35,-0.9843,0.0762,"u/Lapras78 I have worked in finance for years (in the USA) and am privy to the SOP for disasters. After a disaster occurs and an emergency is declared by local or federal government, the standard practice is to suspend payments for a period of time. (By the way, this usually happens during hurricane season, at least on a local level, so the practice is very familiar to every major financial institution.) This doesn't mean you won't have to pay, and the situation will depend on the financial institution, but generally speaking mortgages will have payments put on hold. And afterwards, during the recovery period, there is usually a call center helpline established by each company to help answer questions or concerns, should you have trouble paying after the hold period is over. Other creditors usually adopt the same plan, but not always. Hopefully this practice trickles down to renters in the form of landlords placing payments on hold (NOT always), but individuals will have to work out the payment plan with the landlords. I would say don't expect your landlord to have a plan for you until something happens, but it's also not in their best interests to kick people out during an emergency. Utilities usually offer a similar solution. Always remember that when in doubt, you'll have to wait for the event and then call your creditor/landlord/etc to discuss the situation. As far as work is concerned, if you have an office job, it may be worth asking your employer about the disaster plan, should a national emergency be declared by the government, advising people to stay in their homes. The worst that they can say is: no you cannot work from home.Edit: Clarification added.",People cant work to pay bills if they have to stay indoors,2020-02-03 22:33:31,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eylw3s/people_cant_work_to_pay_bills_if_they_have_to/

fgi145m,0.8176,0.0,"One dangerous factor about all of this is that not every hospital contains the kind of drugs or equipment that are being used to treat patients. As of right now we know that the one experimental drug from Gilead is being used in compassionate cases. then there's the doctors in Thailand who are using HIV medications to treat patients. Both of those types of medications are not usually kept at a hospital itself in large quantities. Instead, those medications are kept at specialty pharmacy facilities located in regions around the United States. CVS/Pharmacare, now CVS Specialty, is one of them, for example. If a large enough quantity of cases were to present in the United States, there would have to be a massive undertaking and coordination between drug manufacturers, specialty pharmacy distribution centers, shipping agents, and logistics companies, to disperse the medication necessary across the United States. I do not know if we have that kind of network in place right now, nor do I know if it's possible to even build something like that in the amount of time that it would take to be effective against the coronavirus.Then there's the actual hardware. Many hospitals only have only a handful of positive pressure rooms. Many hospitals lack the machinery, such as advanced ventilators to reduce the risk of barotrauma. Many patients will have to be sent to level II or I trauma centers if their conditions degrade to the point where they cannot be stabilized in small town medical centers or smaller hospitals. This will put a huge strain on regional medical centers and hospitals in larger cities. there may be an uptick in the utilisation of helicopters to transport patients long distance, but helicopters are expensive and require designated landing areas that are only provided by certain facilities.","NIH doctor says 25% of coronavirus cases in China are ‘very serious,’ requiring ‘intensive care’",2020-02-03 22:36:59,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eylxj8/nih_doctor_says_25_of_coronavirus_cases_in_china/
