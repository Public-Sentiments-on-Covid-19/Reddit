fgi3k0n,-0.6054,-0.6249,"We will probably see many countries closes borders across the world in attempts to contain it. If you have unrestricted border crossings during a pandemic, it will be that much harder to keep track of infected and possibly have a reintroduction. This is why the reports of soilders shooting residents trying to escape locked down cities in China  is so chilling. The CCP is doing anything to contain this because it's that bad. I pray the world is able to get a hold on this. But maybe we are just in a delayed line and it's coming for us.

fgi4zuw,0.701,-0.6249,"You're right. What makes it hard is that shutting down the border isn't as simple as pressing a button or flipping a switch. Closing a border requires the mobilization of border control agents, possibly military action, the set up of more checkpoints and patrols, as well as diplomatic negotiations. If the border is officially closed at a certain point, it could take a very long time for it to open back up. In addition, the amount of money spent on compliance is going to go up, while trade with Mexico or Canada will become much more difficult. That means that we would likely have to involve Congress in the discussion as well. We all know how much Congress loves talking things through in a rational and level-headed way.","If there was ever a time to seal the US borders, this might be it.

fgi535s,-0.9795,-0.5423,"When it’s not seasoning a steak or rimming a margarita, **it turns out salt also works pretty well as a virus exterminator.**  At least that’s the **finding of a University of Alberta engineering researcher** who is taking salt out of the kitchen and putting it to use in a medical setting.Specifically, the research from **Hyo-Jick Choi and his team shows that a coating of salt (sodium chloride) can significantly improve the effectiveness of the common surgical mask against various pathogens.**“The filter membrane (of the mask) doesn’t deactivate virus, but **when it is treated with salt, the virus loses infectivity within five minutes**,” said Choi, a professor in the U of A’s department of chemical and materials engineering.Choi noted that people who currently wear the masks to stop the spread of diseases such as influenza and SARS are likely not as safe as they think.When someone coughs or sneezes, existing masks can block the virus-laden droplets that are expelled. Yet the virus continues to live on the surface of the mask, making it a potential source of contamination simply by someone handling it.This is where coating a mask’s fibrous membrane in salt can help, Choi said.**In such specially treated masks, droplets from a cough or sneeze will initially dissolve the salt. Then, after a short period of time, the moisture begins to evaporate.****“And during the evaporation process, the salt ions gather to form the crystal again,” he said. “The crystals grow very sharply and they actually physically destroy the virus.”**Choi said employing a process of physical destruction is a more effective method than trying to coat the mask in some kind of anti-viral biological agent, which would have to be modified frequently to match the mutations of viruses.**“With physical destruction, it doesn’t matter what kind of protein structure the virus has,” he said. “Whether we have H1N1 flu or H5N1 or H2N2, it doesn’t matter.”**As well, the ability for the salt to completely destroy the virus **means each mask could be used a number of times,** whereas current masks should be thrown away as a biohazard after each use, he said.Choi came upon the idea while working on an entirely different problem.**His main area of research is around the development of technologies to prepare for a pandemic.** Specifically, he has been looking at how to create a stable oral vaccine, like a candy, which could be distributed, stockpiled and preserved more easily than current liquid vaccines. This has proven to be no easy task, in part because putting a vaccine in a solid, candy form tends to produce sugar crystallization that destroys the biological material.**“I realized the crystallization, which is bad in developing a solid vaccine, we could use that same principle to kill viruses,” Choi said.**The team’s research, which included results from testing on mice in South Korea, has been published in the academic journal Scientific Reports. Choi has also received a provisional patent for the technique.He said the work to date has proved how the salt coating concept can work, but many more challenges must be overcome before such masks are used by medical professionals or the public.For one thing, the coating process is expensive.As well, Choi said there is a concern with breathability. Masks with a thicker coat of salt are more effective, but that coating makes it harder for wearers to get enough air.The coating may also not work well in humid environments, where it can dissolve.“I can say this is not the optimal condition yet,” he said. “So we have to find the balancing point.”Asked if he plans to form a company to develop the product, Choi said he has yet to make a decision. For the moment, he is still seeing funding to continue the next stage in the research.","Salt-coated surgical masks kills viruses &amp; makes them reusable, says researcher",2020-02-04 00:45:22,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eyn70w/saltcoated_surgical_masks_kills_viruses_makes/

fgidjod,0.6767,0.0,"So the pdf says an avarage of somewhere around 60micrograms/m3 but that's annual.&#x200B;Looking at this realtime map gives us very little in that regard. From one of the Graphs it seems that their So2 spike around december. So that increases it a little. But it's still averages. Within the red areas I see values from <100 up to over 600. so this is probably calculated somehow from spread out stations. That means that a few spikes can cause huge discrepancies here where we see it ""raw"".  What we would need would be to see a graph per station of So2 over the last year with at least hourly average in order to start guessing.Also So2 comes primarily from fossil fuels so I honestly think this is quite miss-leading. &#x200B;But lets do some rough napkin calculations. According to wiki a human body contains about 0.3% sulphur. With 70kg body that's about 210 milligrams. Converted to micrograms that's 210000ug.If we say that the current averages are 300ug/m3 one burned body could give this avarage to roughly 700m3. So2 has a mol weight of about 64, o2 16 so 48 of that's the so2. Roughly that means we have to increase that 700m3 with 25% so 975m3.  Lets say 1000m3 to make things easy.&#x200B;So2 is heavier than air so it sticks close to the ground. Lets say it stays in the lowest 20m for easy of calculations. So rough map of the place lets go with an area that's 25x25km.25000m\*25000x\*20 = 1,25\*10\^10 m3 of air in this central region of Wuhan. Now divides this by the 1000m3 each body pollutes and we arrive at 1.25\*10\^7. Or 70 000 000. I don't think they burned 70 million people this morning.Even if we concentrate it a single meter in height of air layer you would have to burn 3,5 million people for this. And this assumes all the sulphur gets turned in to So2.Then we take the normal avarage (which we still lack correct data for this example) as a base we still arrive that it's an exorbitant amount of people that would have to be burned.&#x200B;And this is within a very small area. It doesn't take in effect winds or that the place actually is larger.So some rough calculations shows that no this doesn't prove that they are burning bodies.

fgifaxe,0.9076,0.0,"I added this somewhere else, but putting it here as well.I don't know for a fact how many crematoriums are Wuhan, but I saw a very good summary on this exact subject last week and took notes from it. I can't find the Chinese video from about a week ago, so if anyone has the link, please post it! I'm taking this on recollection and the notes I made at the time, so bear with me. AND keep in mind that this was from early last week.In the video the guy said that Wuhan has 7 crematoriums (I haven't been able to find a source on that) and if the mortality rate is \~2% (official) of the virus then we can use that as a baseline.The normal death rate should be somewhere around 0.5-0.7% of natural causes (I don't recall if it was .5 or .7 but it should be possible to substantiate) So if the city is 10m people, then around 50-70 000 people are dying pr. year naturally. Divide this by 365 and we get an average of around 200 deaths pr. day. 200 divided by 7 is \~28 bodies pr. crematorium. Furthermore, if we then check how long it takes to burn a body (I read that it's usually 1.2 to 3.5 hours) and we have an idea of what the normal operating hours of the crematorium is, which has been said to be 4 hours of burning pr. day to dispose of these 28 bodies, meaning they should have around 7 ovens pr. crematorium (I'm assuming, but seems plausible). And we know that they're now going at 4-6 times the normal average rate if they are now going 24/7.This means around 800-1000 minus 200 from natural causes, giving us 600-800 of the virus. At the time guy in the video stated that since the official CCP rate was 2% and that we could divide 600-1000 by 2% and see that the actual number (back then) was 25-50 000 in Wuhan alone of KNOWN cases. This did not account for the unknown, which could probably be twice that, and which fits very well with the earlier Doctors and Nurses statements of 100k (for which they were being prosecuted for saying)He also said something about the infection rate being 1% and that out of the 5 million who left the city prior to quarantine, and went who knows where, around 50 000 were infected...Again, if anyone has the video, please link it.",China burning bodies en masse,2020-02-04 02:09:42,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eynycd/china_burning_bodies_en_masse/

People want facts and sadly many of the facts are negative, so that gives the impression people only want negative news. People are concerned and want to stay on top of developments. No one needs to prepare for a normal day, but they may need to prepare for a bad one if they know it's coming. That's why people care. This is actually quite normal human behaviour and is one aspect for what has led to our species' impressive survival and growth. Some people are overreacting but it's not at all surprising that there's fear and uncertainty and the best way to deal with uncertainty is to provide facts and disprove lies.If you see the sea waters receding rapidly does it mean the tide is going out or there's a tsunami coming? You will try to use facts to decide. And the only way to get those facts is to use your brain to decipher the data around you. Some commenters here think it's ridiculous to be concerned. Some people also didn't run from the tsunamis when they came, they actually walked out in to the dried up ocean to collect fish. Those people died. We're currently at the stage where the sea waters are receding rapidly. It's not clear whether that means there's a tsunami coming or not but people don't want to sit back and do nothing. They're waiting and watching and getting ready to run, just as a sensible human should.As for your input on the data. Yes, ""manageable"" is a perfectly acceptable word to use right now. But that isn't going to stop me keeping abreast of the figures as they come in. Remember at one point China would have thought their numbers were manageable. Complacency can mean disaster.You see the sea waters receding and say, ""They haven't gone out far yet, there's nothing to fear."" I see the sea waters receding and I'm not jumping to any conclusion, I'm watching and waiting to see how far they go and I'm telling those around me what I'm seeing.

If sellers knew the motives of each buyer, they could sell a generator to the customer who needs it to keep life-saving medication from spoiling instead of the customer who wants to watch TV. But sellers aren't mind readers. One way generators can be allocated efficiently is by allowing the sellers to increase prices in an emergency situation. If the generators that are available cost more than they normally would, the people who would be willing to pay a premium to get one may do so because their need is greater.

fgj04fj,-0.9899,0.0,"One of the interesting paradoxes I’ve experience, especially working in disaster areas, is that the more ideologically-centered and totalitarian a regime, the worse they handle the unexpected. If they plan something, and control the execution and narrative, such systems can be remarkable efficient (for a time), but they become unwieldy bureaucratic disasters when things drift outside of their control, or a situation evolves past their ability to understand it. Once that happen, you end up with a whole bunch of people trying to solve problems they aren’t qualified to solve, while simultaneously attempting to hide the extent of their, and the regimes,incompetence. This tends to snowball into mistake after mistake, hostility towards outside help and nonsensical propaganda or outright disinformation (some intentional, some not). One very important point is that such systems tend to “buy their own con”, meaning they actively participate in cognitive dissonance, leading to decisions being based off known bad data - a particular feature that’s very common in Marxist regimes.The nature of such regimes is they’re anchored by a core conceit that they are “correct”. That correctness is rooted in an ideological belief that must be protected at all costs or “the house of cards” collapses. Anything that damages the prestige or image of the ideology, and provides an argument that it’s not “correct”, in some fashion, must be suppressed. Criticism, constructive or otherwise, is simply not tolerated as the system and, by extension, it’s leaders, are always correct.This makes such systems incredibly inflexible as it’s very difficult for them to acknowledge and learn from mistakes, while simultaneously making bad decisions based on their own bogus data.This is why healthcare workers, around the world, still don’t have a compiled profile for this virus, regarding symptoms, progression, complications and other important aspects of how to treat this bug, despite two months and thousands of known treated cases. This is why it’s taken a month to get CDC personnel on the ground in China. If this were happening in the US, India, France, Japan, etc., we’d already have such data and they’d all be far more concerned with figuring out how to address the situation, versus saving face and protecting the image of the regime.",Just my observation...,2020-02-04 06:57:55,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eyr7s8/just_my_observation/
fgj4b0m,-0.2392,0.0,"So I think that:1. China is lying. This is very bad because the rest of the world doesn't know crucial intel about this virus. They simply are not to be trusted. They want to solve the problem but they also need to save face. It's in their authority gene for too long. I think that the efforts of China to stop this virus was, are and they will be tremendous . I have no doubt. But this was, is and will be also valid for their efforts to hide the truth.  2. The origin of the virus is the tricky part. I mean the ***real*** origin. The official story is that this virus came from the seafood market. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe this virus occurred naturally. Or maybe not. If not, now that's a big story.  3. If this virus did not in fact occurred naturally, then it's somehow the human factor involved. So it's artificial. This artificial occurrence can have only two types of action associated: intentional or unintentional action that lead the virus to spread to humans. If unintentional, than the answer is maybe the BSL-4 lab from Wuhan. If intentional, than we have some other answers. 4. I don't know a lot about the reality from China. But it seems that there is a lot of big commotion over there. And I don't know a lot about this world but I see measures taken from big players unseen until now. For what I can reason, all this commotion and heavy measures is directly affect China. I mean this country economy. Money again. 5. So I think, if we are following the money, that the logical explanation is somehow that this natural accident is not that natural and not that accident. I don't like the word conspiracy. I like instead two words: truth and lie. Instead of categorizing some event as a reality or conspiracy, I prefer to make it simple. I like it classic. Truth or lie. 6. China is lying but China is also almost dying. And I really don't think this is an accident. And if this is true, maybe someday we will learn who is responsible for this.

I have no doubt. But this was, is and will be also valid for their efforts to hide the truth.2. The origin of the virus is the tricky part. I mean the ***real*** origin. The official story is that this virus came from the seafood market. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe this virus occurred naturally. Or maybe not. If not, now that's a big story.3. If this virus did not in fact occurred naturally, then it's somehow the human factor involved. So it's artificial. This artificial occurrence can have only two types of action associated: intentional or unintentional action that lead the virus to spread to humans. If unintentional, than the answer is maybe the BSL-4 lab from Wuhan. If intentional, than we have some other answers.4. I don't know a lot about the reality from China. But it seems that there is a lot of big commotion over there. And I don't know a lot about this world but I see measures taken from big players unseen until now.

fgjd9pv,0.9557,0.0,"The previous post regarding the Wuhan crematoriums was taken down, but I think this needs to be discussed and from what I have seen in several posts now, there are A LOT of bodies. Normal bodies do not get put into hazmat body bags for cremation, so we can deduce that from this video this crematorium has at least 20 additional bodies to incinerate. This only adds strength to the argument that the crematoriums are going 24/7 now. I don't know for a fact how many crematoriums are in Wuhan, but I saw a very good summary on this exact subject last week and took notes from it. I can't find the Chinese video from about a week ago, so if anyone has the link, please post it. I'm taking this on recollection and the notes I made at the time, so bear with me. AND keep in mind that this was from early last week.In the video the guy said that Wuhan has 7 crematoriums (I haven't been able to find a source on that, but here is a  [map](https://i.imgur.com/mFFN8IF.png) . If someone can verify the validity it'd be appreciated ) and if the mortality rate is at the official \~2% of the virus, then we can use that as a baseline (Even though the Lancet stated a much higher number).The normal death rate should be somewhere around 0.5-0.7% of natural causes (I don't recall if it was .5 or .7 but it should be possible to substantiate) So if the city is 10m people, then around 50-70 000 people are dying pr. year naturally. Divide this by 365 and we get an average of around 200 deaths pr. day. 200 divided by 7 is \~28 bodies pr. crematorium. Furthermore, if we then check how long it takes to burn a body (According to Wikipedia it's usually 1.2 to 3.5 hours depending on fluids etc...) and we have an idea of what the normal operating hours of the crematorium is, which has been said to be 4 hours of burning pr. day to dispose of these 28 bodies, meaning they should have around 7 ovens pr. crematorium (I'm assuming, but seems plausible). And we know that they're now going at 4-6 times the normal average rate if they are now going 24/7.This means around 800-1000 minus 200 from natural causes, giving us 600-800 of the virus. At the time, the gentleman in the video stated that since the official CCP rate was 2%, we could divide 600-1000 by 2% and see that the actual number (back then) was 25-50 000 in Wuhan alone of KNOWN cases. This did not account for the unknown, which could probably be twice that, and which fits very well with the earlier Doctors and Nurses statements of 100k (for which they were being prosecuted for saying)He also said something about the infection rate being 1% and that out of the 5 million who left the city prior to quarantine, and went who knows where, around 50 000 were infected...Again, if anyone has the video I'm referring to, please link it.","Video from within a Wuhan crematoria, 2/4/20",2020-02-04 09:02:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eyt4hg/video_from_within_a_wuhan_crematoria_2420/

In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.In the article it mentions that the first two deaths were:> The first two deaths were a 61­year­old man (patient 1) and a 69­year­old man (patient 2). They had no previous chronic underlying disease but had a long history of smoking. [...] Of the remaining nine patients who died, eight patients had lymphopenia, seven had bilateral pneumonia, five were older than 60 years, three had hypertension, and one was a heavy smoker.In the discussion:> Additionally, about half of patients infected by 2019­nCoV had chronic underlying diseases, mainly cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes; this is similar to MERS­CoV.19 Our results suggest that 2019­nCoV is more likely to infect older adult males with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune func­ tions of these patients.Furthermore:> For severe mixed infections, in addition to the virulence factors of pathogens, the host’s immune status is also one of the important factors. Old age, obesity, and presence of comorbidity might be associated with increased mor­ tality.24 When populations with low immune function, such as older people, diabetics, people with HIV infection, people with long­term use of immunosuppressive agents, and pregnant women, are infected with 2019­nCoV, prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce complications and mortality.> In general, the characteristics of patients who died were in line with the early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia in our previous study: the MuLBSTA score.8 The MuLBSTA score system contains six indexes, which are multilobular infiltration, lymphopenia, bacterial co­infection, smoking history, hypertension, and age. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019­nCoV infection.As an otherwise healthy 48-year old male with non of those comorbidities, I'm not worried at all. Looks like I probably won't even catch it, and if I do its severity will be about the same as viral pneumonia.  I don't smoke, I don't have diabetes, don't have heart disease, etc.There's nothing in here to suggest that this is any more severe than normal viral influenza / pneumonia.This is also consistent with the reports so far of the one middle aged guy in the Philippines who had coinfection with streph and influenza b, and the death in Hong Kong of a middle aged guy with ""unspecified underlying health issues"".We're currently at 2 deaths out of 215 worldwide, which is a 1% fatality rate.  That sounds worse than seasonal flu which is at 0.1%, but this paper actually suggests that the patients that contract it in the first place are already somewhat immunocompromised.  That means that the exponential math that everyone on reddit does to determine how long it will be before all 7.7 billion people on the planet have contracted it is wildly overestimating how virulent it is.This virus looks like viral pneumonia.

It also takes away any interference China may have in the numbers, removes the issue of China not having enough kits to sample everyone (many more are likely infected at home without getting tested) as well as removes the impact of stretched medical resources in Wuhan atm which likely leads to unnecessary deaths. There are 215 of these people, of which only 2 deaths. Leading to a little under 1% mortality rate. Of course this may rise slightly if some more of the 215 infected are yet to die.

fgjpeup,-0.9928,0.8225,"Unbelievable!!! I always wondered how Zika just disappeared no one talks about it anymore,  Thank you for sharing - I’m so shocked how many people on here are in denial about our medical system being a business and not wanting to run tests or losing business after a Novel Corona case is confirmed there, especially the urgent carr places. They would love to sweep it under the rug as the flu if it’s possible. Please keep spreading your story! Just like the doctors laughed at my family members (5 people) for years and told them they were paranoid when they thought they had Lyme.  Years later they have all tested positive.  My friend’s husband had horrible symptoms for almost a year - to the point of lying in a bathtub all day in pain, blood in stool, but doctors refused to give him a colonoscopy because he was in his early 30s.  Only after after going to multiple doctors and my girlfriend literally crying & begging  they agreed to test.  He had stage 4 colon cancer and just died last month. They refused to give my mother a Papsmeer because she was too old.  I went to her doctor and said “but she had colon cancer, which she told you, and that oncologist confirmed was from HPV.”  The doctor said “oh, yes we should test”.    You can die from HPV,  why not just be safe, not risk a life and run the test?  What do people do that don’t have educated advocates looking out for them??? Really didn’t know how insane everything was until managing my mother’s health.  The gyno still refused to test my mother for a yeast infection even though my mother insisted she had symptoms and was very uncomfortable because again she was too old for yeast infections.  The woman is uncomfortable has had them before and knows what they feel like.  Could you run the bloody test just in case??   I still can’t believe all of it - this is just one instance we encountered similar mind f* situations with other doctors.","I was 7th US citizen to test positive with Zika, and the first several doctors I went to didn’t care or believe me.

That said in the US patients which have been investigated due to close contact are tested and released if negative, however NOT retested after. Which is crap. Also the positive patients are being home isolated because the way this virus works is you feel fine and don’t need medical assistance/intervention ( like regular ICU patients ) UNTIL you quickly randomly develop pneumonia and shit goes south quickly.

They are, quietly, doing as much as they can (in concert with FEMA) to prepare for, what most now acknowledge, is a significant possibility of pandemic conditions. There is a substantial risk of worsening the situation and risks if the CDC (and similar organizations) are not very careful with how the disseminate information and guidance. The CDC is very good at what they do (arguably the best in the world, which is why the CCP’s reluctance to enlist their help is ridiculous), but they aren’t miracle workers and have to work within the constraints of what’s achievable.2. The PRoC/CCP has made the situation massively more difficult for organizations, such as the CDC and WHO, by being absurdly opaque about the situation and not disclosing clear information regarding their finding and observations. Medical professionals outside of the PRoC (and I’d guess most inside) don’t have statistically relevant patient data work-ups around symptoms presentation, disease progression, rates or complications, secondary infections, average durations, and a host of other data that you’d expect to be available after two months of treating this thing.","We must assume containment for coronavirus will fail in the US, says Johns Hopkins’ Amesh Adalja",2020-02-04 10:15:18,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eyuaqf/we_must_assume_containment_for_coronavirus_will/

Everything about the situation indicates the numbers are incorrect.We know the following1) When the virus first started to spread, doctors warning of it’s appearance were arrested.  That’s not exactly an indication of a desire for transparency. 2) The massive reaction of land locking Wuhan, a city of 11m  seemed totally out of sync with the official number of cases being reported at the time.3) The line ups at the hospitals were out of sync with the official number of cases being reported.4) The death count and the number of cases confirmed often moved in sync, and bu similar ratios each day. Very unlikely the disease would act that way, and it indicates a driver behind the numbers other than accurate frequency count. (I.e. formulaic reporting, or process caps that enable certain number of beaurcpatic actions per day)  5) And this is the big one, we must realistically realize that the CCP’s primary mandate in this situation is to maintain social order. A centrally controlled government will absolutely walk a middle ground between reality and societal management.Imo, every news report quoting CCP numbers should have a caveat to those numbers i.e. “According to reporting being centrally released from the CCP...”Or something to that affect.Mark my words, there will be mea culpa’s from various entities for having taken the govt’s numbers at face value.",Wuhan medic says there are many more deaths than reported.,2020-02-04 11:28:55,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eyvi4u/wuhan_medic_says_there_are_many_more_deaths_than/

All patients from an effected country with a fever and another symptom were brought to us. We were given n95s, shower caps from med/surg, shoe covers and a gown. We tried to tell them that wasn’t enough. The only study at the time said that pregnant women would present hemorrhaging(not on the cdc’s list), not with fever. We asked them during our half assed training with our crappy PPE what we were supposed to do..? If any other mom presents hemorrhaging we deliver immediately.

I don't do clinical work now but when I did, a few years ago, the hospital administrators talked about ""readiness for bioterrorism"" but nobody (docs, nurses or techs) ever got formally trained, we were not informed of any algorithms to follow, or new what the designated areas were for victims. I did take courses on my own, but without 'in-house"" training (in-house meaning drills in the hospital), there's little use to theory because each hospital is different and it is necessary to understand how one's workplace will work in case of a catastrophe like bioterrorism or, now, coronavirus. The waiting time at emergency rooms in many hospitals is already ridiculously high and ER's could become a meeting point for sick and well, thus giving the virus yet another opportunity to spread if they get even just as crowded as they get now.I'm licensed and I'm pretty sure at some point they will call me to work clinically again if things get tough.

Your job will become more specific while less qualified people will be hired to do less important jobs you used to do. Church groups will likely donate massive amounts of money, supplies, and labor. Doctors and nurses may leave their private practices or come out of retirement. You will see a flood of semi-qualified professionals taking up tasks they otherwise would not be legally allowed to perform - EMT's, paramedics, cops and firefighters, millitary medics, volunteer first responders. You will also find the military and other government agencies supplying alot of labor and infrastructure in addition to the civilians groups. Most combat troops, for example, even those who aren't medics, are trained for biological warfare and know enough to fill alot of job slots at hospitals.

However, the implications are quite serious if she did not visit China-- it would mean that it has already been **rapidly** spreading in Thailand under our noses. edit: `Follow-up Questions, Food for Thought`* *What does this really mean for countries if it continues to spread?*   * It isn't a deadly virus, mostly those with pre-existing + eldery are dying. I still believe it will put a lot of strain on medical supplies and hospitals. Currently, hospitals have their hands full with influenza already-- and now we add this to the mix??   * It will affect the global economy as travel bans are enforced, China factories suspend their operations, airline and car travel decrease. (I mean, I guess in a sense, it's helping air pollution & global warming... how ironic.) Perhaps we'll see a decline in companies that have more stake in China.* I'd love to point to [Dr. Campbell's YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Campbellteaching/videos) about Nov.

I can’t confirm or deny those things, but I can offer another viewpoint.    I don’t know if they are running the same PCR test the US is running, but I use to work in a lab and there are just so many tests you can run per day.  The test isn’t a pee stick and if it’s blue you’re pregnant with nCov-2019.   It takes hours to run tests properly and they are labor intensive.  If there is a mistake you have to run it again.  Then you are confined to the amount of laboratory equipment you have to run these tests and the assays.  What I’m saying is there are so many hours in a day to work and so many tests you can run.  The fact that they can run 4000 tests a day is amazing, from my standpoint to be honest.   Have you seen the CDC?  They release tests every other day and can’t get through 200 in a week.

They would rather let those children not receive the care they need and die. To look like China can care for all its own issues and doesn't need foreign help.The US offered a medical team to help and China has left the offer unanswered for 3 weeks. Meanwhile, it criticizes the US for imposing travel restrictions to and from China, and ""not helping China""....very clear the CCP just wants no interference in business, trade, and dealing.

That sounds strange but there are limits to what mankind can accomplish in a quick period of time, even with enormous resources bent towards it.  What they can do is slow it down using well known epidemiological techniques.  The foundation of this is accurate widespread rapid testing.  When you have this, you can quickly isolate infected people and do contact tracing (“Who have you interacted with since you started feeling sick?”) and contact followups and monitoring to catch new infections before they can further spread.  This is incredibly labor and time intensive but it works.  Given the exponential rate that then virus spreads, catching even a third of infections early on in the outbreak slows it way down further down the line, giving researchers and public communicators more time to do their thing.",Bloomberg: U.S. prepares for likely pandemic,2020-02-04 20:49:54,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ez3zdv/bloomberg_us_prepares_for_likely_pandemic/
