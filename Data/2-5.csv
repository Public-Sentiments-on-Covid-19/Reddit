So here's what I'd expect to happen in provinces outside Hubei and also internationally. The number of infections and severe/critical cases will roughly grow at the same % we've seen so far but the death rate will remain very low.Then somewhere outside Hubei or outside China the death rate will suddenly climb *dramatically*.I'd strongly recommend watching this, especially from 10.00 onwards when he talks about hospitals not having enough oxygen to treat hundreds of people with pneumonia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1naDPFio04The figures for infection and severe/critical cases and suspected cases -- these will all continue to rise at fairly uniform rates.

Outside of foreign travelers, it doesn’t make sense to do much beyond FREQUENT hand washing, use of alcohol based hand sanitizers, avoid sick people, and not travel to China where this truly is hot. We are talking about reducing the likelihood of contracting the disease, which presently is VERY remote. It’s unlikely that a face mask will prevent you from getting sick if you go to the grocery store. However if you are on a plane to SE Asia, it might mean the difference. Right now, it’s best for people to consider their starting health. If your immune system is strong now, you are better equipped for what might come.

However, it's when that fever never stops and the breathing gets more difficult that they usually go the hospital in the 2nd week.  Where they either recover or die.Here's the problem. Days before they were even sick, they were spreading it.  Then they get sick and shed the virus all over their family because now they are at home and need to be cared for.  THEN they go to the hospital and shed the virus all over those people.  AND, there is scientifically documented evidence from a German study that showed they continue to shed the virus AFTER ""recovery"".

fgmb94e,0.9721,-0.296,"There's the tricky thing, isn't it? I'm in a city with no confirmed cases, yet, but I know for a fact that people who have been to Wuhan have come to this city. My government seems largely unconcerned with the virus at this point. They acknowledge it, but praise the healthcare system and are basically acting like everyday citizens have nothing to worry about. I work in an office with a lot of people who travel internationally. There are people in here coughing on a pretty regular basis, all winter. I could use up my sick days and be back in here next week. I've opted to keep off public transit just in case, but driving has a cost and it's usually outside my budget to park for twenty-whatever-pesos/dollars/euros/etc., so I won't drive for that long before I either go back on the train, or before I stay home for a few weeks. Staying home for a few weeks has a cost though. I don't have enough vacation time to do that and also get paid. I need to make money or I have a certain outcome - I don't eat and I can't pay rent. I think many people are in this position. If we stay home, our lives quickly deteriorate. If we leave the house, we have risk of exposure. On the one hand, the costs of staying home are known, certain, and high. On the other hand, evaluating the possible risk of getting this outside, are largely unknown, uncertain, and unclear. It's a tough decision to make. I'm going to keep leaving the house, and doing my best to see what's happening with the world, but for most of us, I think we don't have the option of letting this blow over in our locked-up, stocked-up houses.

fgntlh5,0.83,-0.7383,"I've just come to realize that every single media source that I can think of has some sort of agenda. Some are more truthful than others, but they all have an agenda. They want to both get/increase views and influence the thoughts/opinions/actions of those watching. They either don't want people to panic or they are in denial about it themselves. The US education system is trash. There are exceptions, but your typical American grade-high school student will have a pretty trash education. Colleges/universities are usually better because they have to be. You can't expect someone to pay $100,000 at least to get a trash education. We could argue all day about the reasons or how it should go about improving. But the point I'm trying to make is that most students in our current education programs aren't taught basic levels of critical thinking. I literally had 1 day in math class in high school that talked at all about logical thinking and coming to conclusions. I had about 2 days over the span of high school learning about where to get credible sources. I was never taught to question what was told to me. Maybe I just went to an especially trash school. But I feel like if someone wants to learn or practice critical thinking, they either have to pay thousands of dollars for college classes, or they have to teach themselves. But most people don't do this, so they don't learn to think critically and then they end up believing what is told to them, or things that are easier to believe, or whatever. These media companies feed off of this and take advantage of it.I also want to make it clear that I'm not saying that Americans are stupid or ignorant.

fgmrpog,0.9334,-0.296,"Testing unexplained pneumonia: I just went through this process in December and early January as I had cough, difficulty breathing, high BP (most likely due to shortness of breath and various meds), and sputum. I went to my doctor multiple times out of sheer luck that an appointment time was open. I also made sure to stay home from work. and had all types labs/imaging done to identify the issue. I had no pneumonia, fever, or any other complications; turned out to be a strain of bronchitis resistant to azithromycin.  Had to take harder medications, inhalers, etc to reduce any inflammation and residual bacteria. I still have some lasting effects as my breathing is ever-so-slowly returning to normal (cold weather does not help). My point is that they tested/imaged me quickly for all types of infections such as TB, HIV, influenza, pneumonia, etc (negative for all). Was also asked if I had been out of the States at all recently (sadly no vacations as of late). Ironically, this was all done in a clinic with my PCP that is not taking any new patients because she is booked solid for months. Funnily enough, I am supposed to see a pulmonologist but the earliest dates in the area were a month to 3 months out. I was able to give my blood for the tests right after my PCP appointment, but an ordered CT had to wait a week. All of this was done at a very advanced hospital in a major metropolitan area with many resources and several dedicated staff completing routine protocols. All that to say: testing patients for unexplained pneumonia is prudent but nearly impossible in places with abnormally large numbers of patients presenting symptoms consistent with pnuemonia, especially at centers with already-depleted resources and personnel. Combine that with the requirement of reporting test results/diagnosis/prognosis to the patients as they possibly present and then leave only delays the entire process. An important question is how do you define ""unexplained"" in a pandemic situation? If the coronavirus only presented via a stomach ache, then eating something or not eating something could result in the symptom. Other circumstantial tests could be done like fecal analysis, endoscopy, etc, but a person would have to consent to this for what only seems like a simple stomach ache. For coronavirus patients, underlying conditions may greatly mask ""unexplained pneumonia"" symptoms as something as shortness of breath after walking up stairs could be considered. If someone coughs in an airport after traveling internationally, do we immediately grab that person and quarantine them? Screening with travel is too porous to work more than 50% at this time.  Even more of a reason to have point-of-care diagnostic tests that can give a result in less than a day, ideally only hours.At some point, outbreak prevention may require a diagnostic point-of care test at airports. You present your ID, your ticket, and your medical clearance (great-but-fictional example would be the iris scan at military checkpoints in I Am Legend). Something like that would probably be a human rights violation unless declared in an emergency state like marshal law.","Stop a U.S. Coronavirus Outbreak Before It Starts - It’s time to start testing patients with unexplained pneumonia, even if they haven’t traveled to China.",2020-02-05 10:24:52,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezdvsx/stop_a_us_coronavirus_outbreak_before_it_starts/

fgmwpyh,-0.3989,-0.296,Yes I was listening to the SF Chronicle podcast today and the brain dead globalist shill reporter said that you did not need worry about contracting the novel coronavirus because it was not circulating in the community. She then proceeded to say that there was no need to be tested unless you had been to China or been in close personal contact with someone who had been. So the only way we would ever start testing people in the community is... when somebody comes into the ER and drops dead of viral pneumonia 10 days from now. At which point we will know it is circulating in the community. I hope the public health people are not so brain dead but I’m not super optimistic. The WHO press conference didn’t give much confidence that public health officials are taking this sufficiently seriously. Why would continued trade/travel links be any kind of priority at this point in the epidemic?,"Stop a U.S. Coronavirus Outbreak Before It Starts - It’s time to start testing patients with unexplained pneumonia, even if they haven’t traveled to China.",2020-02-05 10:24:52,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezdvsx/stop_a_us_coronavirus_outbreak_before_it_starts/

Last week many patients could have been misdiagnosed all over the world.  Say someone who Vapes, gets 2019n-cov.  They go to the doctor with symptoms.   The Dr. assumes since they vape, its vaping illness because that is a big thing being pushed in clinics and Dr.s Offices.      As I was telling someone,   Going to a Personal Family Dr. who may run a lot of tests and labs and going to a ""County Clinic"" or mom and pop Clinic.  Could easily be misdiagnosed for something else. They had no way to test for the Coronavirus even if they did run some labs.   Which from experience and hearsay,  I know clinics and Dr.s that do not run labs.   They associate the symptoms and prescribe their ""Cure"".   it's all something to consider,  especially knowing flights all over the world have been going on for a whole month during this outbreak,  before being grounded,  and that is only grounded from China.

fgnfi1j,0.9861,-0.296,"Even without expanding screenings to any patient with ""unexplained pneumonia"", there's a good chance the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US will skyrocket over the next 7-10 days for at least two reasons:  1. FDA expedited approval for the coronavirus testing assay to about 100 approved facilities across the US.  This means the daily capacity & also turn-around times (due to not having to mail all samples to CDC headquarters in Atlanta) is about to increase significantly starting early next week.  Source:   [https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-coronavirus-outbreak-cdc-sending-test-kits-to-over-a-hundred-labs-20200205-fnwz646sozdd3m3rsxbp6uejcu-story.html](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-coronavirus-outbreak-cdc-sending-test-kits-to-over-a-hundred-labs-20200205-fnwz646sozdd3m3rsxbp6uejcu-story.html)2. CDC screening criterion for getting formally tested for coronavirus 2019 (Patients Under Investigation, or ""PUI"") has expanded as of February 2nd.  Previously, the geographical criteria was *""History of travel from* ***Hubei Province*** *within 14 days of symptom onset.""* Now, that has expanded to, ""History of travel from **mainland China** within 14 days of symptom onset.""  Source:   [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html#criteria-evaluation-pui](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html#criteria-evaluation-pui)&#x200B;Bottom line is, there is a good chance we will see major increases in confirmed case numbers due to a massive increase in both testing capacity and in the number of actual samples being submitted for testing.   Therefore, even if in the next 10 days there isn't a single new case of coronavirus ACTUALLY contracted within the United States (unlikely, but best case scenario), the overall numbers will likely go up simply because they'll be doing a better job of detecting/confirming the cases that already exist.  As other countries expand their capacity to conduct screening tests with these assays, I suspect a similar dynamic will happen with those countries too.  So unless we all get insanely lucky, it's a matter of WHEN (not  if) the numbers of confirmed cases  in several other countries including the US will skyrocket.  The key at that point will be to figure out--is the spike in confirmed cases mostly just countries doing a better job of identifying previously existing cases, or is it largely a function of the cases becoming truly self-sustaining epidemics locally?  Unfortunately, only time will tell.  Once the major confirmation spikes happen, if the growth largely flatlines, then we can assume the spikes were mostly due to just ""onboarding"" prior existing cases.  But if after another 7-10 days the spike continues to grow at a fairly rapid clip, then it suggests that local containment of the virus may be failing.","Stop a U.S. Coronavirus Outbreak Before It Starts - It’s time to start testing patients with unexplained pneumonia, even if they haven’t traveled to China.",2020-02-05 10:24:52,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezdvsx/stop_a_us_coronavirus_outbreak_before_it_starts/

Basically all tests come back negative, and then we've wasted resources on diagnosis and testing that would've been much better spent on diagnosing, testing, and quarantining people who have actually been to Wuhan or China.2. A large fraction of tests come back positive, in which case there's mass panic and local health departments basically throw up their hands and say ""Nothing we can do, the hospitals are overloaded.  Go home, take some Tylenol, and wait it out.  Come back if you can't breathe.""The middle ground, where testing of everyone results in a few additional cases that can be quarantined, traced, and treated, seems extremely unlikely to me.  Either it got here in mid-January already, in which case there're probably thousands of carriers running around everywhere and no hope of halting its spread, or it's not here yet, in which case temporary quarantines and selective testing should delay its entry long enough for effective treatments to be developed.","Stop a U.S. Coronavirus Outbreak Before It Starts - It’s time to start testing patients with unexplained pneumonia, even if they haven’t traveled to China.",2020-02-05 10:24:52,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezdvsx/stop_a_us_coronavirus_outbreak_before_it_starts/

Went back told her upper respiratory infection and no work until Monday. She went to the docs on Tuesday (yesterday). They told her to stay home and gave her a buttload of antibiotics, zpacks, steroids, and breathing treatments. Maybe I’m just paranoid but I was wondering if doctors would write it off as just an URI. That’s what this virus is isn’t it?

fgocn5y,-0.5574,0.0,"Part One (due to character limits) Dr. Sabine van Elsland, External Relationships Manager, Imperial College London interviewing Professor Neil Ferguson, director of MRC GIDA, J-IDEA, Imperial College of London. February 5th, 2020. Transcribed from YouTube J-IDEA website. Good Afternoon, We are here with Professor Neil Ferguson, director of J-IDEA, talking about the current coronavirus outbreak.***Question: Would you be able to give us an update on the current estimate?***Answer: The main things we are working on currently are getting a better handle really on how lethal this virus is to the human population. It’s a difficult thing to do in an epidemic. Because just simply looking at how many people died so far, this is how many cases their are, tells you very little. It takes quite a long time often, from someone from being diagnosed as a case to actually weather we know if they are going to live or survive the infection. So we are trying to correct for those factors. In terms of looking at the overall scale of the epidemic we are getting kind of firmer estimates. What we can say is surveillance ongoing in China is we’re probably picking up, if you think of all infections out there being a kind of pyramid, it’s at the top of the pyramid, the most severe infection. We think probably it 10% or less of all infections in China are being detected at the current time. The next tier down, is really what’s being detected overseas. There we think sensitivity is somewhat higher. But still we may be only detecting maybe a quarter of all infections at that level. Lots of people will be entering, boarders are porous. Countries won’t be detecting every case coming in. ***(1:41) Question: Would you be able to say anything about forward projections as where the outbreak, the current outbreak is going?***In terms of where we think the current outbreak is got to, in terms of scale, we estimate that maybe up to 50,000 new infections a day occurring in China. Which is obviously much larger than the official case numbers. It’s going up all the time so the forward projections depends on the effectiveness of the control measures. We think the epidemic is roughly doubling in size about every five days at the current time. It’s hard to evaluate exactly how effective controls are but there’s limited evidence of it slowing in China. Under that scenario the epidemic would really follow a natural course. Probably peak in it’s epicenter Wuhan in around a month’s time. There’s some uncertainty about that and maybe a month or two later in the whole of China. For the rest of the world, we’ll see epidemics at various times after that depending on how well connected they are - have been in the past few weeks, travelers come to them who are infected from China itself. (2:24) As to the overall effectiveness of control measures it’s hard to evaluate. If there’s a lot of community of transmission going on, and we think there probably is, it will be very hard to control this epidemic in the same way for instance, as we controlled the SARS epidemic, some 15, 20 years ago.","Professor Neil Ferguson, The Director of the J-IDEA is estimating 50k new cases a day with it doubling every 5 days.",2020-02-05 19:06:05,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezlr2p/professor_neil_ferguson_the_director_of_the_jidea/

fgocpik,-0.9964,0.0," Part TwoQuestion: Would you be able to explain how the mathematical modeling that your team is doing can inform policy and government response. Yes, statistical mathematical analysis of epidemic data has quite a long history and it’s really become quite established within the policy framework, policymaking framework used. Particularly in the UK, but I think further afield. And that’s often because what we have is very noisy and limited data in an outbreak and we want to be able to get the most information from that as possible. So advance statistically modeling and then later mechanistic transmission modeling can be useful in doing that. So simple questions we try to answer is, how transmissible is the new pathogen, how long has it been circulating, how much are cases, cases are always underestimated in epidemics, surveillance is never 100% perfect, so ow large is the real epidemic. And then critically important to how people respond is how severe a threat does this pose to human heath.Question: Would you be able to explain a little bit about the uncertainty ranges around the estimates that you report?(4:17)The uncertainty is always high early in an epidemic, particularly in a disease we have never seen before. We don’t know critical things like how long does it take from when someone is infected to when they develop symptoms, (??) of the incubation period, we don’t know how transmissible the disease it. We try to estimate these things from quite limited data. And the limited data means there’s always uncertainty in the estimates which we try to characterize using state of the art statistical methods. So often we we’ll quote something like we think every case generates 2.6 other cases on average, something called a reproduction number. But, there will be a range around that, it might vary from anywhere between 2.1 up to 3.3 or something and that captures how much we know about that particular parameter of interest. Question: And then with that uncertainty range how useful is that to inform policies and governments?ANSWER: In general policy-makers would like everything to be certain. So handling uncertainty is a challenge. I think the uncertainty range tells them what confidence we have in the estimate. If we have calculated it correctly. So if we for instance say, well the case fatality ratio, the proportion of people that might die in an outbreak varies, could be anywhere from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10, that’s not a terribly informative estimate. If we can say precisely the estimate is 1% of case fatality, 1% of people will die, it could be a half percent, it could be 2%, that is a much more useful estimate. Question: And do you have any suggestions as to what the most efficient interventions would be at the moment for either China or internationally? ANSWER: Unfortunately for this virus we have limited options for interventions at the current time. We have no vaccine, through vaccines are rapidly being developed, but it will take months if not years to develop. And some testing of anti-viral treatments, existing drugs being repurposed to see if they work in infections in these cases. The other measures we have to draw upon are called public health interventions. So, identifying as many cases a possible, as early as possible in their disease and isolating them, is how we managed to control for instance, the SARS outbreak. A genetically quite similar virus to this new virus. Weather those measures will be as effective in this case remains to be seen. This virus has a much wider range of severity of symptoms. (6:57)Quite a lot of people being infected may just have quite milder (?) of disease. Might no even seek health care for it. If those people are transmitting, then it will be very hard to stop transmission overall. So the next few weeks will really tell us about the likely hood of control measures working. (7:15) So in terms of intervention the Chinese have been throwing everything they can at this outbreak for the last (it’s only) two weeks. In terms of what might work that critically depends on who is transmitting infection, wether the people who are responsible for most onward transmission are being identified and isolated early enough. The Chinese are currently focused on identifying severe cases and isolating those. It’s unclear weather the mild cases left in the community, and we thing that’s the majority of the cases, are still sustaining the outbreak or not. We’ll know more in the next couple of weeks. At the moment we can’t see much evidence that the epidemic’s slowing down. QUESTION: There have been few fatalities outside mainland China. Would you be able to explain why that is? Why we see that difference with the fatalities that we see in China?So looking at the severity of an epidemic, and looking at how many people might eventually die from it, is very challenging. There were delays, quite often long delays, from when someone is diagnosed, with an infection that may be reported in the media, for instance in Thailand, or Japan, or Hong Kong, and when we finally know what the outcome of that case is. People will persevere, cases will be in intensive care maybe for weeks. We think the delay from when somebody is develop symptoms to when they might die is as long as 20 days or longer, three weeks or so. So the fact we haven’t seen many deaths in travelers, we’ve seen two so far for cases detected outside of mainland China, is not terribly reassuring. We wouldn’t have expected to see vary many so far, because of those delays in the system. What we are trying to do now is account for those delays and do an accurate estimate of how lethal we think this virus is. How worried are you about this kind of outbreak?The outbreak is clearly of concern. It’s probably the most major we call it emerging infectious diseases the world has seen since, at least since the pandemic of influenza in 2009 and maybe since the SARS outbreak in 2003. So we don’t fully know enough to be able to estimate the full scale of disease burden we call it which will affect the human population, how many people will die, But it’s something that certainly governments need to prepare for urgently in terms of ramping up health system preparedness. and in particular undertaking rapid research to try to develop treatments which can reduce potential fatality in severe cases of disease. How is the work that you do funded?So the funding for the work we do here comes from a number of sources. We are fortunate to have generous institute funding from Community Jameel to fund our work not just on responding to outbreaks but much broader work on how the world responds to other forms of health crisis, includes climate change and the like. We then receive a lot of research funding from individual research funders, within the JIDEA, we have the MRC center for global infectious disease analysis, generous funding from the UK medical research council, we receive a lot of funding from other funders as well.","Professor Neil Ferguson, The Director of the J-IDEA is estimating 50k new cases a day with it doubling every 5 days.",2020-02-05 19:06:05,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezlr2p/professor_neil_ferguson_the_director_of_the_jidea/
