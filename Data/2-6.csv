fgp76kr,0.8173,0.4404,"I think comparing the Chinese to all the other countries there’s two things to note: 1 Chinese medical care is not as good as the other countries that are dealing with this. Obviously the number of cases the Chinese is hit with isn’t helping. There’s a lack of staff, equipment, meds, supplies and space. I suspect the deadly pneumonia is secondary infection and if the mild cases would receive treatment vs being sent home to develop pneumonia the numbers of deaths or serious condition would be lower. All the other countries had the heads up and are monitoring the cases from the get go so even if there’s a slightest change they can treat it instead of letting it get to that point. It’s easy to put all your best doctors and medical staff on 1-2 cases and that’s their number 1 priority vs having to treat hundreds a day with no space or supplies.

The majority of people who have taken notice and reacted in the last 2-4 weeks are people ahead of the curve, although that curve is catching up as time progresses.The more people who react, the more it will trigger other people to react.  If enough people react (or overreact) at the same time, it will cause people to become fearful.  Enough fear will just lead to more fear, terror, and panic, so it should be expected that all info coming from official channels (to include the CDC) will be in service of containing the virus, but also minimizing this panic and the collateral damage from terror.  This will of course mean omitting or minimizing information that could spread fear or terror.",Anyone else feel like we are being lied to?,2020-02-06 05:29:25,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezsdaa/anyone_else_feel_like_we_are_being_lied_to/

fgpypfc,-0.9176,0.0,"Okay. I have some background in this and I am trained to read scientific papers so I’ll dissect this paper and dispel some misunderstandings.SARS-CoV from humans and civets (\~99% similarity)SL-CoV from horseshoe batsHIV pseudovirus is not the actual infectious HIV-1 strand. It is a derived strand that has the characteristics of HIV but it is not infectious on its own. In this study, it is just a vector to deliver the S protein to the ACE2 receptor.Pseudovirus definition: “A **pseudovirus** is a recombinant viral particle with its core/backbone and envelope proteins derived from different viruses1; moreover, the genes inside the **pseudovirus** are usually altered or modified so that they are unable to produce the surface protein on their own.”Results:* Bat SL-CoV S protein cannot bind to human ACE2 so bat SL-CoV cannot enter to infect humans.* Human SARS-CoV protein cannot bind to bat ACE2 so human SARS-CoV cannot enter to infect bats.* Switching the receptor regions from SARS-CoV to SL-CoV: the S protein from SL-CoV can enter humans.* This study was not about the HIV pseudovirus strain. The pseudovirus was injected with the S protein and was used as a delivery method to ACE2 cells. NO ACTUAL ANIMALS WAS USED IT WAS JUST LABORATORY TEST CELLS.Mechanism of S protein and ACE2: “The two strands show major differences between N-terminal regions in their S proteins.”S protein is responsible for entry to the host of the virus through binding to a receptor and fusing to the membrane of the host. This means that the S proteins in the two different strands have different mechanisms in binding to the host. The S proteins bind to receptors called ACE2 receptors in humans.  There is an identified 193-residue fragment of DNA in the SARS-CoV strand S-protein that is corresponded with this ability to bind to ACE2. They found that mutations (deletions or changes in these 193-residue fragments) could completely stop S protein from binding to ACE2 which would completely stop the binding of the virus.What they’re trying to test: They found that there is a significant amount of deletion in the S protein from the bat strand. They’re predicting that since there is a huge difference in the bat S protein sequence that they cannot bind the the human ACE2 receptor which means that the SL-CoV will not work in humans.How they’re testing it:* HeLa cells: human cell lines used for scientific testing (very widely used) and then it is recreated so that the ACE2 receptors are in the human cell line so that they can test the enzyme activity in these cells. There are human ACE2 with ACE2 with human origins and human cells with ACE2 expressed from bats. NO BATS OR HUMANS WERE INJECTED WITH ANYTHING. THESE ARE ALL CULTURED CELLS.* Creating recombinant strains: HIV-based pseudovirus are combined with the S protein receptor. Another strand of pseudovirus with a control vector (no S protein). They basically used the S proteins from SL-CoV and SARS-CoV and combined them with the pseudovirus.* Checking if the strain and ACE2 inhibitors are functional: they did enzyme activity tests (assays) using antibodies obtained from mice to test it. NO ACTUAL MICE WERE USED JUST THEIR ANTIBODIES.* They perform ACE2 activity tests (assays) to test if the ACE2 and S protein strains worked. They tested the ability of the pseudovirus strains with the different S proteins from different animals to see if it recognizes and binds to human ACE2.",Wuhan Virology Institute Spliced HIV segments with bat Corona Virus in 2008,2020-02-06 05:56:17,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezsotk/wuhan_virology_institute_spliced_hiv_segments/

fgr4fai,0.9342,0.0,"As an American living in Hong Kong, I have some serious problems with the credibility of this post:1)  There are 85,000 US citizens in Hong Kong, if the consulate (note, there is no embassy in Hong Kong) were calling all of us, word would get out FAST.  All of us would have heard this via other sources.  Yet we haven't.Word of this would have hit all the local social media, the HKFP, Apple Daily, and the SCMP.  There would be a stampede at the airport.  Yet there's not.2)  My wife and I are both enrolled in STEP, the consulate has our phone numbers.  Yet neither of us, and none of our friends or colleagues, and none of the other Hong Kong folks on this thread, seem to have gotten this pre-recorded call.  Funny, that.  Of the hundreds of Americans I know in Hong Kong, nobody has called saying ""holy crap, did you guys get the same robo-call I got?""I work for a multinational, and I guarantee that if the US consulate were advising evacuation, we would know.  We would be putting in place business continuity plans to minimize the disruption to our business from having key stakeholders leave.3)  In this environment, if the consulate (note, not ""embassy"") calls you and says to leave, you leave.  You don't wait 3 weeks.  With 85,000 Americans being told to leave, you would be worried about getting any possible flight out.  If you have 3 weeks, it's not an emergency4)  Mail service was indeed delayed over the national holiday, but we've been getting packages all this week.  Food delivery services are running, the restaurants, while not full, aren't empty.  5)  There is indeed panic-buying on things like toilet paper, because of rumors that Chinese factories making the stuff have shut down.  There's lots of food on the shelves.  Grocery stores are not shutting down, I have 3 within a few blocks and all have good selection.  My most charitable interpretation is that the poster's brother made a sensible decision to send his wife and kids to hang out with her family for a few weeks to see where things go, and might have embellished the story to make it sound more sexy.  Some of the details appear to be accurate, but many don't.It's another reason to read everything cautiously and with great skepticism. Again, if I get a call saying to evacuate, I'll share.

fgq6rts,-0.9887,-0.836,"Dr. Li Wenliang, who originally reported coronavirus in December 2019, is reported dead of the virus. This is the most bizarre and unusual news yet to come out of this entire story thus far. Consider that earlier this month, China told the WHO (or it was reported elsewhere):The death rate is 2% (Also commonly cited by authorities and mainstream outlets)80% of deaths are over age 6075% had underlying diseasesThailand, Washington State & Chinese doctors all found medicines that supposedly helped dramaticallyIf this is the case, if you get the disease, you supposedly have a 2% chance of dying. Of those 2% who die, four parts out of five are over 60, so if you are under 60 you would have to be one of those 1 part out of 5 to die. Further, if you are under 40, the chances must be even smaller. Further, if you have no underlying disease, the chance is smaller still. The chance of a 34 year old healthy man, who is a high profile figure sympathetically regarded nationally & surely by medical & judicial authorities, and receiving medical treatment, dying, is supposedly abjectly low, well below 1%. That leaves a number of possibilities:1) He was very, very, very, very, very unlucky. While possible, this would be a remarkable coincidence, as he is only one of a handful of very high profile cases in the world. He is one of the few people in all of China whose death cannot be covered up.2) The mortality rate is a lot higher than 2%. That would be in line with the 23% I posted yesterday.3) The government deliberately killed him to somehow punish him for whistleblowing. While I heard some people (morbidly) hoping this to be true due to what it would imply about the CFR, what this implies about the government's intent & what else they are suppressing is perhaps even more terrifying.4) He had an underlying disease that has not been reported. It is possible, but he looks quite healthy in photos. Plus, he was an active doctor.One other thing is extremely strange about the official story of his case. He first noticed symptoms on January 10 and was in the hospital by January 13. Between then and now is 3 weeks. Current CFR that are lower than mine depend on an assumption about the time frame of death, that it occurs relatively quickly, whereas recovery takes longer. If this doctor was ill for 3 weeks and died at the end of this period, it suggests those assumptions are off.There is yet another very bizarre and strange facet of this case. It is reported that he tested negative for the virus several times before finally testing positive around January 30. There was another case of a woman in Hong Kong who tested negative, then positive later. The same is true of a case in Canada. This could lead to the very disturbing possibility that the virus can live at such low traces that it cannot be picked up by current testing methods. People could be testing negative & then being released falsely. The second, somewhat more reassuring possibility is that he originally simply had pneumonia, but caught coronavirus in the hospital. However the problem with this is that it contradicts the official story, which is quite specific: He got it from a woman he was treating for glaucoma. Further, if this was true it would be known because he would have tested positive for either bacteria infection or other known viral pneumonia. In sum, the death of Dr. Li Wenliang raises a number of problems and for the first time I am afraid,A) The government is not being nearly as straightforward as I had thought, and/orB) The mortality rate is higher than thought, and/orC) The virus is, unknown to us, undetectable even by existing common methods of nucleic acid testing","Chinese doctor Li Wenliang, who was accused of spreading rumors after trying to warn colleagues about coronavirus, has died of the illness",2020-02-06 06:58:53,/r/Coronavirus/comments/eztho9/chinese_doctor_li_wenliang_who_was_accused_of/

fgq6m5y,-0.9864,-0.4404,"yup.  I'm with you.  I'm a data analyst and you can't use the number of confirmed tests to be your total population you're comparing because those people are still incubating.  And since we've been told the incubation cycle is anywhere between 2-14 days, if we look at the confirmed cases just 14 days ago, we were just between 1,000-2,000 positive-tested civilians.    As you say, you need to divide the deaths by the sum of the deaths and the recovered to find the current fatality rate.  Now, that is not a fixed rate and the numbers will change and the % will fluctuate.  From what I've been seeing since the beginning of this month, we've been seeing a 28-35% fatality rate against the numbers, which is quite alarming.  Though, as others have pointed out, China is not publishing completely accurate counts, so this data we have is not really helpful except the deaths and recovered outside China.  Since it went worldwide not long ago, we have to give the data more time before we start drawing conclusions about ratios and death rates and only compare the reported cases outside China.   And that brings up another problem, the CDC is no longer publishing their counts/statistics for us to use. There is a petition floating around to force the CDC to provide us with the facts. The CDC does not want to stir an economy crisis through fear and chaos during this time without a vaccine, so that is my guess as to why they stopped reporting numbers.  I could be wrong but my city (Houston) was screwed when the government told us not to worry about Hurricane Harvey and a leaker told us what the government knew and we were going to be hit hard, and the mainstream media said not to listen to the leaker and she was fake news.

I’m not sure if I’m just guessing, or if I know the reason, but I’m pretty sure it was for mosquitoes. I think that in central California they Drop chemicals from planes at night and warn us that you’re supposed to clean off objects that were outside during the night so you don’t consume this chemical that is for killing the mosquitoes to prevent west now virus.So it’s really just our perception because of where we’re from. I guess in Panama it’s OK to get doused by a pick up truck running around the corner quickly. I was actually very mad that that happened to us. There was no time for me to react or avoid it. And in China, they don’t really care at all, on top of having serious illness spreading, so it probably makes sense that they would rent some fog machines.

So you should get a decent estimate of the serious illness rate from this, as almost everyone will be diagnosed. We currently think around 20-25% of patients get severe disease, and perhaps 2.5% die. It will be useful to know if the figures are actually lower than this.Of course, the cruise ship population will likely have a much higher median age than a non-selected population would, which will increase the serious illness/death rate.The serious illness rate will probably be the best data (how many people get pneumonia, how many people need ICU-level treatment), as quality of care is likely to be excellent - which is great news if you’re on that ship!",7000 People on Those Quarantined Cruise Ships Will Expose How Bad the Virus Really Is,2020-02-06 13:26:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezzffk/7000_people_on_those_quarantined_cruise_ships/

fgrk1xx,-0.8917,-0.4404,"I feel like the underlying source of racism comes from not the virus itself, but from its origin. Who knows what the truth is, but what do you think OP? Or any Chinese/Chinese American reading this thread?As the commonly accepted theory is that this virus originated from a live animal market in Wuhan, the world has criticized China's culture or subculture of eating wildlife and its treatment of animals.I'm sure these are exaggerated cases, but I've seen photos or videos of dogs being boiled alive, of people eating bats, rats, and have read about civet cats and hedgehogs being delicacies. I've seen there's even a youtuber who has a bamboo rat farm and makes jest of slaughtering these rats and he has like a million followers or something ... the rest of the world doesn't eat this way or make jokes about taunting animals before killing them for food...So, I feel like if anything, the criticism of China is over the animal market issue, or the lack of sanitation involved. And this isn't the first time something like this has happened in China, so what's the deal?It's easy to blame a country for a virus when ""they eat rats, bats, and cats"" that are sold in live markets, in terrible, inhumane, unsanitary conditions. People in the Western world  don't see these types of animals as food.I've also read that people have been throwing their domestic pets out of windows from high-story buildings out of fear that they're carrying the disease.I am sorry OP that you are experiencing racial prejudice. I am aware that certainly not all people in China have these habits or attitudes that are highlighted by the media, but even if these things are prevalent in a minority of a country of over a billion people...it's still a lot.The negative stereotype about Chinese people eating cats and dogs has been around for several decades, and when viruses like this emerge out of live animal markets, it only fuels racism.I am not saying this is right, but I think that fear of a deadly virus is a natural human reaction, and because it has been mainly prevalent in China (and is very contagious), people are naturally wary.If what I've seen on animal markets in China is true, then I'm not saying all Chinese people are morally corrupt, but I think that Chinese people who aren't into it should understand that if this is happening in their country, the rest of the world isn't going to look favorably upon it, especially when a pandemic can be traced to a live wild animal market.",As a Chinese-American I’m Scared,2020-02-06 13:55:17,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezzvca/as_a_chineseamerican_im_scared/

fgqov4p,-0.9741,-0.34,"EDIT: This is the article (it's an opinion piece)Coronavirus is dominating the headlines due to the primal, inherent fear of contagion that unites humanity. In this case, our fears are warranted.Recent coverage has been walking a fine line between simultaneously reporting the facts and seeking to calm the waters. The risk of coronavirus to the U.S. is low. You have a much greater chance of dying from the flu. And so on.This is true at the moment. But we are clearly in the early stages of a global pandemic, and coronavirus is much nastier than the flu. Exactly how much nastier remains to be seen, but we are at the mercy of forces largely beyond our control now.The current best estimates place the [mortality](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/) of coronavirus [between 1% and 3%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html#virulence) with modern medical care. This only sounds low; in fact, it is a very high number. Seasonal influenza kills about 0.1% of patients with the virus, which translates to roughly 650,000 deaths around the world every year.Coronavirus is more infectious than the flu, and possibly a lot more infectious. If the current numbers are to be believed, it is at least 10 times as lethal as the flu today, which puts it close to the virulence of the influenza strain that killed 50 million people in 1918. Despite medical advances, the world is far more crowded, and hence more vulnerable, than it was in 1918.Coverage of the conditions in Wuhan has, at times, taken a faintly patronizing tone. Hospital footage of people lying in hallways and masked crowds waiting for days has been shown with the subtle though distinct implication that such scenes would not happen here.This implication is wrong. This is exactly what would happen here, because the U.S. is not remotely prepared for a coronavirus pandemic. The reason for this is simple: there is hardly any excess capacity built into the U.S. health-care system.American medicine is designed for profit, not for public health. Hospitals are kept as full as possible all of the time. Empty beds are expensive, and hospitals lose money on them. So there aren’t many empty beds.In normal circumstances, this rationed market-driven approach works almost well enough. But any significant surge in seriously ill patients will quickly grind our already overloaded system to a halt, and cause secondary effects far beyond the impact of this particular virus.On any given day, the emergency room where I work can have 40 or 50 patients waiting for many hours in the lobby to be seen, and often a greater number than that.The emergency room itself is often filled with admitted patients waiting for beds to open in the hospital above us. In many cases, they wait in the ER for days.When overcrowding like this occurs, which is common everywhere in the U.S., we have no place to see new patients, and try to examine them in the hall or even the lobby itself. Both efficiency and patient safety plummet as a result.ICU beds are already at a premium, and are already precious things That’s business as usual.","Yes, worry about coronavirus: Those saying it’s just not that deadly are missing a few key points",2020-02-06 14:22:06,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f009yk/yes_worry_about_coronavirus_those_saying_its_just/

fgqx530,0.9505,0.3818,"Does this factor in the possibility of a potentially significant past/current bottleneck being rapidly expanded over the next week or two?Specifically, I think many nations (certainly the United States/CDC) had pretty limited capacity for formally testing & confirming suspected cases. In the US example, all suspected cases had samples sent to CDC headquarters in Atlanta for testing. It required transit time & I believe a several day backlog prior to testing. Much of that is changing in the next 7-10 days. (See details below). Therefore, even if there’s literally ZERO new cases in the next week or two in some of these countries outside China, there is a high chance we will see a notable spike in reported cases outside of China, simply due to the “on-boarding” of previously existing (but heretofore undetected) cases. Details: 1) As of yesterday, the US government regulatory structure (FDA) fast tracked & approved the assay to be used more widely at qualified labs. CDC is now sending out 200 assay kits to approved labs throughout the US & another 200 kits to other labs internationally. It sounds like there will be a few days of training, but by early next week, the overall capacity per day to conduct these tests will basically expand 400 fold & the turn around time will be somewhat shorter due to less transit time. 2) The CDC (and possibly other national health organizations) recently broadened the screening criteria healthcare workers are to use in identifying cases to be tested.

We traveled through one of the busiest airports in the US with our 2 year old child and we came down with symptoms about 48 hours after. The symptoms weren't terrible the first few days; runny nose, mild fever and sinus congestion. We went to the doctor on vacation and they said sinusitis, so just fluids and Tylenol was all. When we returned from vacation it moved down into the upper respiratory area for everyone and we all got a dry, hacking cough that was very difficult to control. Everyone's recovering now, but I used to be a heavy smoker up until about 8 years ago (I'm mid 30s). With how difficult it was to combat that hacking cough and phlem with clear(ish) lungs, I can't imagine how hard it would be for someone who's much older than me and a lifetime smoker. Sitting on the couch just trying to clear my lungs all night for 2 nights straight was awful.

On first inspection this statement looks unsupported if not ridiculous.•Wuhan health service has clearly been overwhelmed by numbers.•Most cities don’t have the ability to deal with thousands of cases of sever pneumonia concurrently.•If the numbers are larger than repeated it would logically hold that a huge % of severe patients would not be getting adequate treatment leading to preventable deaths•Other counties have much smaller counts of patients - numbers their health service can deal•Most counties which are resorting cases had better health services than China to start with and had weeks to prepare and also some indication of what they would be faced with.This doesn’t mean that higher death rates than reported are a fact.

Thus far the sample of people infected have had several things in common: International travel.A.    If for business the prerequisite for that is that they are valuable enough to a profit seeking corporation that they were willing to pay large sums of money and send this person to make them more money.  B.  If for pleasure or to visit family the prerequisite is that they were able to plan ahead, save the money, take time off of work, etc.These are generally individuals who have their shit together.  This is not a representative sample of America.  2.  The characteristics of the virus.  When we have a larger sample of patients with defined timelines it may very well look like the previous cases studies, that you are exposed, you have 2-14 days to find out if you are going to get sick, then mild illness for 2-9 days, then you either get better or you develop pneumoniaFor patients who develop pneumonia they can usually be saved with supplemental oxygen, if they can get it.  Sometimes those patients seem to get better for a little while and then die anyway of multi-organ failure.So, once you start getting sick you have a choice to make.  Do you go for testing in your area that has a local epidemic and turn yourself over to the military/FEMA/Public heath at a time when they may not have the resources to properly care for the volume of patients they are receiving?  Do you sit tight at home and make some chicken soup and hope for the best?  Or do you use the 9 days in between when you know you're sick and when pneumonia develops to try to get yourself (or your family member) TO A HOSPITAL THAT ISN'T FULL and can give you oxygen if you need it.  If you wait to have pneumonia and can't get in locally, it's too late.
