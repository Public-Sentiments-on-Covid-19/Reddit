I think many people assume that the Trump tariffs have shifted a lot of manufacturing away from China, but in reality they've only shifted final assembly away. The majority of components in things like consumer electronics products will still come there. Try making an iphone without the camera lens, or the volume FPC or the LCD for that matter. Sure other countries make these things. But China makes 80% of them. So if this goes on long term, you'll suddenly have 100% of the demand  scrambling for 20% of the supply.

This is a novel pathogen in a virgin population, so it strains the immune system hard. There have been many cases of people who were recovering and then suddenly developed severe pneumonia, very likely due to secondary diseases.If you consider the dire situation Wuhan is in, i would assume that people are getting discharged asap, probably without prophylactic AB treatment. Couple that with bad hygiene dur to shortage of personnel and medical equipment, population density and shit air quality, and you can imagine bacteria having a field day.It's gonna take some time for an accurate description of the disease, but realistically 2-3% is a pretty pessimistic estimate.

I live in the US and am not nearby any of the potential cases here, but I’ve been glued to Reddit, YouTube, Twitter, etc following everything since about January 23rd. I spend several hours each day reading and learning about what’s going on in the world, and my father in law has friends in China who he does business with (his main business relied on plants in China to manufacture his products for his customers, so he has been paying attention as well).My initial reaction to everything was intrigue - who did this, how did people get infected, etc. Then I was really taken aback when the government began quarantining large cities and shutting things down around China. This was really the first “this could get really bad” moment for me. As we all know economic drivers are always at the center of all government thoughts, and for China to stop things it must be very bad, and it has been.My next thoughts left conspiracy and “how did this happen” and went to “what next?”. We’ve seen governments stay quiet and probably for good reason. As the OP says if mass hysteria was created world wide that would create many more problems that don’t currently exist. I do believe there are many people in wait and see mode. It is encouraging to know that not everyone who is infected with this virus is automatically given a death sentence. Hospitals across the world will need to be prepared if and when the virus is more prevalent in their cities, and I believe that almost everywhere will be affected to some extent. Now I go to what now? I continue to pay attention to sources in which I feel are reliable. I do believe that many governments in the East are under reporting numbers (clear speculation, but given what we know about overcrowding hospitals and people self quarantining without being diagnosed I think it’s fair to say more are infected than we have numbers for). I’m not sure how the next couple weeks play out but what I would like to see is people coming out of quarantine and being healthy, people who contracted the virus becoming healthy, and some additional information on treatment. If these things happen then I believe we will see the spreading of the virus slow down some. I don’t think it will just stop all of a sudden and I do believe this will impact parts of our world for many months to come. Until then, we should pay attention to what’s going on around us. We should be cautious about where and how we travel as well as practice excellent hygiene. I’m not sure if this is the lull before another major outbreak or not. In my own personal opinion I don’t think we will see another “Wuhan” spread now that more people are aware, but I do think it will continue to spread at a lesser rate over time.",The lull before the storm?,2020-02-07 03:53:39,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f09gbb/the_lull_before_the_storm/

Vaccines are months and months off if not years and the HIV med surge production would not even scratch an exponential demand. Best case scenario: The west gets lucky, contains every infected person, while the poorer countries get major outbreaks and we are swarmed with potentially infected waves of refugees. How long will that hold? Are western countries even willing or able to enforce harsh quarantines on borders? Maybe we get a rushed vaccine in 3-4 months. How fast can we mass produce and administer that, while under huge economic and social strain? Are you willing to beta test such a rushed vaccine? There is a good reason vaccines usually take years.My guess: 10 Feb when CNY gets extended again, buisnesses will panic and the panic will spread downstream from there. Or Chinese will start culling their own people in a desperate bid to save their econ and it will buy them a few days maybe 2 weeks. They will report that they starting to get the situation under control.Every poorer country is a free meal for that thing and no, western countries wouldnt have the ressources to help them at that time.

There are only hypotheses for why flu and coronaviruses should be particularly active during winter, most emphasising that people tend to congregate indoors in winter, and that relative humidity is greater in winter. These viruses need a water 'envelope' to spread and they would tend to lose this in hot, dry weather.However, another plausible explanation is that during winter at high latitudes, sterilising UV radiation does not reach the ground.

By tracking each patient and monitoring those that had contact and self-quarantining while it is indeterminate, the rest of the world has so far been successful in keeping the infection rates low and sporadic. Provided that continues, things should be good. I questioned the 2% fatality rate for a while, but the below demonstrates that it is, in fact, pretty accurate for a given infection. Wuhan skews those numbers due to an overwhelmed system either leading to high mortality or an under tracked diagnosis rate.https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6Let's just focus on closed cases outside of Wuhan. We know Wuhan is overwhelmed but every other area is staying ahead of it for now.Deaths: 638(everywhere)-618(Wuhan)=20 deaths outside of WuhanRecovered: 1764-867=89720/(897+20)=2.2%So if you live in a place NOT overwhelmed (this is not Wuhan), then you have a 2.2% chance of death from current evidence.I suspect we could say an environment is overwhelmed when it breaks out of that trend. Wuhan has 618 deaths per 867 recovered. It indicates only the most severe cases are being tested and counted.

We agree that there is no need for panic, but also that given the information we have access to (including the fact that the china numbers are likely fabricated), the best course of action is to be prepared and start avoiding crowds as of now. This will protect both you and the general population because you will not become a disease vector, and you will be freeing up public infrastructure as well as masks etc for those on the front lines who really need it. Avoiding people is the safest bet by far, if you can swing it. Also, remember that high proof liquor (closer to 70% the better) works just as well as the gel and it's easier to get. Always clean your hands before you eat and don't touch your face.1) we don't know how easily it is actually transmitted2) long incubation period and transmission with no symptoms make it very stealthy3) we don't yet know how deadly it is4) don't trust any official information coming out of china.

Pay attention to the international cases, the cruise ships, etc. Even there, read between the lines. A lack of information should make us more cautious, not less.

On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and “remains isolated at home.”) see;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-02-04/first-us-coronavirus-patient-released-from-hospital%3fcontext=amp","If 82% has MILD symptoms, why aren't they better yet?

N95 is a classification by the NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health).The N is a classification indicator that it is not resistant to petroleum (doesn't matter in our use case) and the 95 is the percentage of filtered particles. You can also find so called N100 respirators and filters, but they are much more expensive.The Europe system follows the European norm EN 149 for respirators and classifies them via as FFP1 to FFP3. While FFP just stands for ""filtering face piece"" and the number indicates the 3 levels of sealing and filtering ability.FFP3 is considered to provide a very good seal with at max. 5% leakage (average at 2%). It is supposed to filter at least 99% of toxic substances, as well as droplet aerosols, cancer and radioactive substances, enzymes, microorganisms (viruses, germs, fungi and spores) and other dangerous substances, which concentration can reach up to 30x the allowed concentration at your work place.So get some FFP3 masks they have higher filtering abilities as N95 respirators,Yet the best mask is to not touch your face.Your list so far is decent.

fgukkin,0.5799,0.0,"That is absolutely correct.  Floor drains in a bldg tie into a main at some point.  Floor drains aren't necessarily always ""wet"" meaning the trap is not filled with water (water evaporates over time).   Janitorial contracts normally call for cleaning staff to ""wet"" traps on a certain frequency (pour water into the floor drain).  If the cleaners do not do this, when you shut off air handlers (fans) in a high rise and traps are dry, you will sometimes smell a displeasing odor.  HOWEVER, check out this study, link below, supports that SARS traveled much longer distances in air (across the street and down the block - several complexes away).

The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and “remains isolated at home.”) see;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-02-04/first-us-coronavirus-patient-released-from-hospital%3fcontext=amp",A Good Bit of Information on nCoV,2020-02-07 15:08:53,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0iobi/a_good_bit_of_information_on_ncov/

It would leave economic scars on the country for years. Lets say it infects 20% of China, or around 300 million people. This isn't unheard of with flu epidemics (and just to be clear it almost definitely wont hit 300 million infected with the crazy measures china is taking). That is *3 million people* dead. That is tens of millions of hospitalizations. That is every single city in China becoming nearly unlivable due to economic collapse and rapid decline in transportation and due to the economic and health issues of this virus. Life expectancy would take a major hit as healthcare systems focus 99% on the virus, the Chinese economy would collapse, the country would go into debt unlike anything we've ever seen before. It would be unlike anything we have seen in the modern era. Just complete and utter collapse of the economy, both in China and the world, if this thing spreads everywhere and has a death rate of 1-2%. I am not saying the death rate isn't higher, but I am saying that even if the death rate is 1-2%... they are absolutely justified in these measures. 1-2% is very high for a pandemic. The worst modern flu pandemics usually have a death rate slightly above 0.1%, and they still are a huge worry worldwide. Any massive disease epidemic which has a death rate that high has to be controlled at all costs.","400Million people in China are now under quarantine.

Coronaviruses are a nightmare inside healthcare facilities and many patients require weeks of care to recover. Ventilators, isolation rooms, oxygen supplies, personal protective equipment, doctors and nurses are in limited supply even under normal circumstances.  When you add hundreds of thousands of acutely ill people (and rapidly increasing) in a short period, it quickly overwhelms the capacity of health systems. Keep in mind that most hospitals operate under normal circumstances in excess of 90% of their capacity.  All of the other causes of hospitalizations and outpatient visits did not suddenly disappear to make room for these coronavirus patients.

However people who are newly infected today have an unknown prognosis.  It can take 2-3 weeks to reach a resolution of “recovered” or “dead.” The true case fatality rate is instead (dead)/(recovered + dead).  So to estimate this number, a more accurate rate is dividing the total number of confirmed cases from 2-3 weeks ago by the total number of dead to date, as anyone who has died was already infected by that point.  However, even this metric has problems because we don’t know how many people with mild symptoms failed to seek medical attention and are sick, but unconfirmed.Edit: Replaced  the term “mortality rate” for case fatality rate to improve accuracy of post.","400Million people in China are now under quarantine.

fgus1wu,-0.9935,-0.5106,"Full article for non subscribersFeb. 7, 2020, 7:10 p.m. ETOne patient, admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China, infected at least 10 health care workers and four other patients with the coronavirus that has sickened more than 31,000 people, killed 600 and reached two dozen other countries.The case was just one disturbing detail in a new report on 138 patients in Wuhan that helps explain how the illness progresses and how it spreads.The report, one of two published on Friday by JAMA, is among the most comprehensive articles to date about people infected with the newly identified virus.The patients ranged in age from 22 to 92, with a median of 56 years, and were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan. 1 to Jan 28. Many of them — 41 percent — were presumed to have caught the virus in the hospital, including 17 people who had been admitted for other illnesses, and 40 health care workers.The patient who infected so many health workers had been placed in a surgical ward because of abdominal symptoms, and the coronavirus was not initially suspected. Four other patients in that ward also contracted the disease, presumably from the first patient.The incident was a chilling reminder of the “super-spreaders” in outbreaks of other coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS — patients who infected huge numbers of other people, sometimes dozens. The phenomenon is poorly understood and unpredictable, an epidemiologist’s nightmare. Super-spreaders led to considerable transmission of MERS and SARS inside hospitals.Reporting on Friday in JAMA, the authors said their data suggested that rapid person-to-person spread of the virus had occurred among their cases. That was in part because of patients like the one admitted to the surgical department, whose symptoms misled doctors into suspecting other illnesses and failing to take precautions to prevent spread of the virus until it was too late.About 10 percent of the patients did not initially have the usual symptoms, cough and fever, but instead had diarrhea and nausea first. Other uncommon symptoms included headache, dizziness and abdominal pain.Another cause for concern was that some patients who at first appeared mildly or moderately ill then took a turn for the worse several days or even a week into their illness. The median time from their first symptoms to when they became short of breath was five days; to hospitalization, seven days; and to severe breathing trouble, eight days. Experts say that pattern means patients must be carefully monitored, and it is not safe to assume that someone who seems to be doing well early on is out of the woods.The finding is a “heads up” to doctors to keep an eye on these patients, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a recorded interview posted by JAMA.Like previous reports on coronavirus patients, this one found that older people and those with underlying health problems like diabetes, heart disease or cancer tended to become more severely ill than younger, healthier patients.Over all, about 26 percent of the 138 patients needed intensive care; their median age was 66, compared with a median of 51 years for those who did not require intensive care.For this series of patients, the death rate was 4.3 percent, which is higher than the estimates coming from other parts of China. The reason is not known, and the figures may change as more information is gathered.",New Report on 138 Coronavirus Cases Reveals Disturbing Details,2020-02-07 18:14:30,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0l0li/new_report_on_138_coronavirus_cases_reveals/

It seems like the cruise ship in Yokohama is a special case and for the most part there have been no detected cases of local spread from people diagnosed and hospitalized in the west who had left China. And I know people tend to believe we’re not catching every case but it’s been long enough (first case reached U.S. January 15, almost 3 and a half weeks ago) that even if we weren’t catching every locally spread case we’d certainly be catching some if it was becoming epidemic.

Putting your whole trust on them at this point is not advisable and this is not a study. This is basically an opinion piece. And can't stress this enough, only referencing the German case. There has been more cases of asymptomatic transmission since then. They also assumed it's R of 2.0 which I believe is much higher now. Pandemics and outbreak studies are a whole field on their own and have no deep knowledge on the subject but why do people who are more in the know somehow negate the fact that an asymptomatic person is more likely to mingle with people compared to someone showing symptoms.And your title has a different conclusion than what is on this page.> In the ongoing outbreak, assuming an R of 2·2, as reported by Li and colleagues,1 then just over half of infections must be prevented to bring R below 1. This might be expected to be challenging if 2019-nCoV can be transmitted when infectors are not symptomatic.>However, there is little evidence to suggest presymptomatic transmission of 2019-nCoV.2 Even if 20% of infections are occurring because of presymptomatic infectors (a level roughly halfway between the respective values for severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza viruses,3 which is likely to be an overestimate), then 80% of infections would be due to symptomatic infectors. Because only slightly more than half of infections need to be prevented to bring R below 1, effective isolation of symptomatic hosts alone should be sufficient to prevent sustained outbreaks of 2019-nCoV outside China.Page is saying to bring it to 1, you need to isolate those with symptoms because they are likely the bigger cause of transmission.

This is also inconsistent with various CDC and White House statements that the virus spread cant be contained but slowed down, which suggest an R > 1. And they have every reason to play it down, because of panic. Also take into account that containment is gonna get harder from here on out not easier since the countries with active epicenters will increase not decrease. I've seen Lancet studies which suggest mortality rates of 11%, which seems wild since we know testing is skewed towards cases with more severe symptoms and therefore do not represent an accurate picture of the situation.

fguwcj4,0.8625,0.1027,"Because the only people who have been exposed in the west all knew that they were exposed and have been socially distancing?Reading the NYT article about how this got out of control it seems like CCP cadres knew about the outbreak and actively suppressed information to avoid causing embarrassment during January party meetings that are supposed to be only good news.So the virus doesn’t need to behave differently, the difference is that if everyone is informed and social distancing happens R<1 but if everyone is ignorant until there is a huge pool of infected people and everyone goes about business as usual then R is approximately 2. Also hard to know if you can believe the Chinese numbers or not but if they are actually reflecting reality then you can see that the daily infection rate is going down. If that’s true it would seem to imply that social distancing has greatly reduced the spread.That said I’m only cautiously optimistic and this could be just rose colored glasses. Could be the calm before the storm here. That said, even though cases can take up to 2 weeks incubating, it seems like more typical is 3-5 days so you would think we would be seeing cases if it were spreading.","A new, relatively optimistic epidemiological perspective out in the Lancet today: key claim is that there is limited evidence of asymptomatic spread and R0 &lt; 1 outside of China",2020-02-07 18:37:49,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0laoo/a_new_relatively_optimistic_epidemiological/

fgv6ydv,0.9596,0.0,"They may be interested in the symptom progression of the 2019-nCoV from day 1 to day 12.This is from: The First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States - a 35 year old male with no underlying health conditions.https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and “remains isolated at home.”) see;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-02-04/first-us-coronavirus-patient-released-from-hospital%3fcontext=amp",Parents leaving on cruise?,2020-02-07 18:53:29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0lh81/parents_leaving_on_cruise/

She is told he is in forced quarantine, and she asks back why he doesn’t have his phone then. The friend shows a clip of someone else knocking on the door of QiuShi’s place, no answer. The friend addresses a message to government officials, saying he knows everyone will say they are just following orders and are afraid of losing their jobs, but if everyone says no to their superior then the government no longer has authority. He gives information on himself, saying QiuShi’s got the public looking out for him, so now he wants the public looking for him as well, and if they all look out for each other they can protect each other. These are some really ballsy statements.Edited to add the second half: Apparently QiuShi had a white motorcycle and the white motorcycle was still parked outside his place so he didn’t take it with him. Also, the authorities said he is under forced quarantine because his whole block was quarantined for being sick. However, the friend said QiuShi wasn’t sick.

He had also been taking his temperature regularly and it did not go above a 37.6 celsius, indicating there wasn’t a reason for him to be forced into quarantine.

We contacted local health departments who contacted the emergency contact individuals  and spoke with them and we had airline information on when they touched down and would contact them when they landed to coordinate 21 day monitoring including physical checks and video monitoring while people were taking their temps depending upon factors.
