fgw3o32,-0.5678,-0.6486,"Those numbers are believable, if we are using a means to project from earlier known numbers. It would certainly explain China’s response and the measures they’ve taken, even if they started later than they should have. There’s loads of peripheral evidence to suggest that this is the scale of the outbreak. The size of the quarantine, the extreme measures, the absolute panic among the populous, the cremations all point to this outbreak being a huge and scary thing. We’re most certainly not talking a few thousand here. But I honestly think we can never know for sure. So many aren’t going to the hospital and if they did, the hospitals have an extremely limited supply of test kits. They have to triage in order to conserve those test kits. Unfortunately, even those that do head for a hospital don’t get tested, and I’m sure that people of influence get preference fir these test kits. So, we can estimate 1.5 million people infected all we like, but we really just don’t know. It could be higher, it could be a bit lower. We may never know. What we can do is keep an eye on what pertains directly to us. I live in the States, so knowing there’s 12 infected who are apparently in quarantine is important. Keep an eye on the news and look out for signs that it’s spreading.., that’s important. Biggest thing to remember is that outside of China, things are under control. Yes, that status could quickly change, but for now we are relatively safe. The only thing we can do is prepare, stay informed, and relax. There’s plenty of time to panic, if that’s what people are going to do. There’s no need to burn ourselves out so early. It’s entirely possible that this thing will burn itself out and leave only China affected in any significant way. I mean, I’m not worried at all at this time. Long ago I prepared for “Shit Happens” type things. I’ve seen enough events in my life to know that sometimes things just go to shit. And knowing you have done what you can to be ready takes a lot of that stress off you. But that’s not quite the point of your post, so I’ll leave it at that. I just saw your reply to a comment having to do with knowing the real numbers so you can be prepared: if your focus is on China, you can’t be prepared. Unless you go to China, it doesn’t affect you like that. If eighteen million are infected in China, it doesn’t affect you, but national news and local news talking about an outbreak wherever it is that you live... well, that’s a different story. Unless the Chinese start becoming zombies... if that’s the case... we’re all fucked lol","Whistleblower Miles Guo: 1.5 million confirmed cases. 50,000 dead.",2020-02-08 00:01:16,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0onsk/whistleblower_miles_guo_15_million_confirmed/

All else aside, and thinking whatever the fuck you want about the Chinese govt, we should all be thankful for the people of Wuhan (etc) for going through this process when it's to try and benefit the entire world - including your arse. They may have failed with containment, but hopefully the process has at least brought the rest of us, and the medical/research population some time to study the virus and get pathways in place for treatment, as well as being able to prepare if it goes the way of a devastating pandemic.

fgw2z1b,-0.9885,-0.34,"I think the key thing being ignored here is that nCoV favored place of replication is apparently ""ACE2"" receptors. Sure the virus causes pneumonia since trace amounts are in the lungs, but I think the main target for the virus is the endothelial layer of the Heart where most of ACE2 is found. This could be an explanation for the ""sudden death collapses"" we've been witnessing on the leaked videos of people spontaneously falling and dying. This could be a fucking heart virus. So even if you ""seem"" recovered from pneumonia, that means the virus has reached your heart after distracting your immune system. This could explain why Ji Wenliang died despite being in the 30s age range.. Trumping that only old or immunecompromised people are susceptible to the nCoV.This ""leaker"" could be confirming suspicions that indeed the process is flu>pneumonia>then heart attack or sheer sepsis shock.EDIT: Also this explains why some subjects who were ""cleared"" after the flu subsided or seemed completely fine only to just suddenly deteriorate immediately to a Pneumonia attack. This seems like tiered stages that ""unlock"".EDIT 2: ACE2 is also found in the kidneys, which coincides with medical reports stating that nCoV also causes kidney failure.

You may have learnt from media report that this virus is spreading in Wuhan, a central city of China. To prevent the disease from spreading, Chinese government requires all enterprises to start their work on February 10. So all logistics providers can not provide collecting services before that date. We fully learn that this will keep you waiting for a long time and result in poor shopping experience. To guarantee your rights, you are entitled two options:(1) cancel your order if the shipment date is not acceptable for you, or (2) wait for shipment on February 10.

I’ve been packing hand lotion and Lysol wipes in my thirteen year olds backpack for a week, begging her to wipe her desktop for each and every class. I have no doubt that she will remember now.

Highly recommended viewing for everyone. The differences in outcomes for Pittsburg and San Fransisco tell the whole story for me.

fgykuxv,0.9648,-0.5824,"Oh...hey!  A big cyber hug to you from New Zealand.I'm trained in NLP which isn't relevant except for the way it perceives anxiety and paranoia as a skill, rather than a problem.  Basically your natural tendency towards these means you have a hidden superpower (well that's how I think of it) so please stop thinking of yourself as broken.  Yeah, you have issues...like 99.9% of the world.  But the silver lining is you can address problems before they manifest.  You would be a natural at crisis management which is why you are feeling a rush of energy to act now and prepare.Right.Normalisation...firstly get some good info on the virus.  I recommend Chris Martenson/Peak Prosperity on Youtube.  He is qualified and would only react if there was good reason to.  He believes most people will be ok, BUT the complication rate with nCOV is higher than normal so this + supply chain disruption are the most important issues.Now to the family.  I get how disconcerting family can be when they dismiss concerns.  Can't do anything other than handle yourself as best you can as that is all you have control over. Preparations:Any prescription meds need to be picked up as much in advance as you can because we just don't know what parts of supply chain will be affected.Top goal is to stay out of ICU.  OK to get sick or even get the flu...but definitely want to minimise it as hospitals may get overrun.If you are/were a smoker or have spent extended time in smoky rooms then you have good reason to be concerned as it looks like this is the group worst affected aside from very old/young/weak.BASICSElderberry syrup at the first sign of a sniffle is proven to reduce symptoms and duration of viral infection.  Get some/make some.Serrapeptase (I use Drs Best, 120,000 SPU) will break down phlem if it is stopping you from breathing and particularly handy if you are asthmatic or have had trouble breathing when sick in the past.  It must be taken at least 2 hours from anything else.  I'd include avoiding medication or anything other than water taken orally because it is quite an expensive supplement so wouldn't want to waste it.  Best use case is as you are going to sleep at night so you can get proper rest without coughing up phelm every few minutes.  TRUST ME, it works.  Those enzymes break down the phelm like magic and is a significant improvement over cough syrups.Boosting your B6 can prevent cytokine storm.  Cheapest way is nutritional yeast but not sure how much is in there so could get supplement for this.  I haven't bothered either for myself or my family but I have nutritional yeast in my smoothie most days and I already have the elderberry syrup.Aside from this just normal 'flu stuff.  Try to have groceries as much in advance as you can - this is mainly to handle supply chain disruptions rather than lockdown.  I'd focus on things that would be really gross, or annoying if you can't get them such as sanitary pads/tampons, toilet paper, toothbrush heads/tooth paste.  Illness is just part of life.  You probably won't die if you don't have a mask but they are nice to have.  In China they are compulsory in some regions atm, and it is part of their culture not to wear one if sick so as not to contaminate others, but also necessary given the density of population which I'm guessing is much, much higher than Florida.","I’m scared, my family is not taking this seriously",2020-02-08 08:48:15,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0u2z5/im_scared_my_family_is_not_taking_this_seriously/

Thus, even though a lot of people left China before various travel bans, not a lot of infected people left China. Most of these infected people are asymptomatic, which means they are not actively spewing out virus by coughing or sneezing and, even then, their viral loads are low. So, infected leavers of China are not as infective as people who go to hospital in Wuhan.  As with all population aspects of China (or India), you need to consider their huge populations.

There are now too much indicator to me that this is going to  go full global catastrophic. Here is how i process :\-It  already happened 100 years ago, when the world was less connected and  less populated. An H1N1 strain killed 5% of the world population then  mutated in less lethal form maybe to survive because of lack of living  host. It killed mostly healthy and young men.\-An official 2 % mortality rate is already really high.\-Chinese  government are know for covering everything that don't suit them.  Provinces are quarantined, hospitals are crowded, sick people have  nowhere to go and dies at home, army is deployed and some internet  source says lot of dead bodies are burned and erased from statistics. 2%  or 700 dead at this time seems really a small odd number to me.\-It  is heavily contagious.  Like if someone have it and just take an  elevator, the next people will have it. If someone have it and cough,  the infectious airborne droplets will evaporate only to left a  crystallized viral particle that can travel in the dry air for hours.  This is plague level contagiousness.\-TV  News are not or little talking about it. Strange. Usually they always  seeks for selling you fear, and they have a potential deadly virus with  evil Chinese coverup, they just have to pick one of those Chinese video  on social medias. But not this time. Why ? Do they know something we  shouldn't ? Is the goal is to prevent panic in population ? Have they  guidelines from governments ? This make me think something big is  hidden.\-People around me are  unaware of the situation. Like very unaware. My lovely gf is a nurse,  but she get annoyed every time i talk about the CoronaVirus. Like it is  just one more flu to her, and it can't hit us because life is always  more easy to us Europeans. I had to explain to her why 50 millions  people in quarantine is concerning. She now understand and play the  game.  I struggle to find in real humans how feel concerned. I stocked  some food and water in case things go bad.\-People  in my country do not have the discipline of Chinese people. Here, citizen are king.

fgzi1ol,-0.9586,-0.6815,"No, I don't think it is like HIV. I'm sure that the people who have recovered have had blood work done to test for the presence of the virus still in the blood. It seems that this is something strong immune systems can fight, like the flu. HIV virus can't be eradicated by the immune system or by drugs, so that's not a similarity. This virus doesn't seek out the cells of the immune system and obliterate them in the same way that HIV does. However, you are definitely correct that this is clearly much more serious than the flu. We keep reading about how the flu has killed more people in the US this year than corona has killed in all of China, but I doubt that statistic is true. Like you said, entire cities in China wouldn't be shut down over a flu outbreak, and emergency hospitals would not have gone up over the flu. My feeling is, given the contagious nature of this virus, it's likely impossible to eradicate it at this point. I think coronavirus is probably here to stay, thanks to the lack of response in adequate time by the Chinese government. This will just become another vaccine we'll all be advised to get every year, like the flu. Although you can take your chances with skipping your flu vaccine, this doesn't seem like a virus you don't want immunity against. The scary thing really is that these viruses can mutate, which is why it's recommended to get a new flu shot every year. There's no saying what will happen with this one, because it hasn't been around long enough to tell. There is a correlation between infectiousness and mortality rate. The more infectious, the lower the mortality rate. This one is highly infectious, with a mortality rate of probably closer to 5% (not being told that - my own estimate), whereas something like HIV is not highly contagious but ultimately always lethal. Hopefully this virus can be contained in other parts of the world, but with China being China, a massive country populationwise, and a big player in the global economy, I think eventually the world will have to open its borders again, endangering its own citizens to the threat of this novel coronavirus being out in the open.

I don't know who made the translation. It would require a medical translator to accurately tell us what it is they're saying....because , like i said..**droplets do float in the air, but they are not medically speaking airborne!** Having an accurate translation and asserting how they arrived at that conclusion is crucial to know what to do with the information. **So far, CDC and WHO have not said anything about ""airborne"" 2019-nCoV; they continue to say it's spread by droplets and fomites.**Airborne (medically speaking) transmission involves smaller particles (less than 10 micrometers) that float in the air for longer periods of time and for longer distances. Therefore, no direct contact is needed. This is the case for measles, tuberculosis and, to a certain extent, SARS. Droplet transmission involves particles larger than 10 micrometers that can float in the air for shorter distances (1-3 meters) and do so for a lot less time.  You can acquire these diseases from droplets (cough or sneeze, spit while talking, etc) from a person too close to you (CDC and most experts say 1 meter, some say 3-5 meters).  Such is the case for non-pneumonic plague.Many diseases can be transmitted in more than 1 fashion. SARS for example, is regarded as a disease mostly transmitted by droplets, but recent studies have shown a small proportion of cases were probably acquired through the airborne route.

Some are smaller. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256501251\_Characterizations\_of\_particle\_size\_distribution\_of\_the\_droplets\_exhaled\_by\_sneeze](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256501251_Characterizations_of_particle_size_distribution_of_the_droplets_exhaled_by_sneeze)When do ""airborne"" size particles occur? We normally expel particles, very small ones, just by breathing,..the size in the category of ""airborne"". Also, there are daily life (e.g. sneezing, flushing the toilet) and medical procedures (e.g. nebulizers) though, that can ""aerosolize"" droplets, breaking them down into smaller ones that last longer and reach longer distances, some particles small enough to be  ""airborne"". It is important to know whether a disease is airborne or not, because it has different implicatoins for prevention strategies.  For example, what mask should health workers use. Respirator filters that collect at least 95% of the challenge aerosol  are given a 95 rating. Those that collect at least 99% receive a “99”  rating. And those that collect at least 99.97% (essentially 100%)  receive a “100” rating. Respirator filters are rated as N, R, or P for  their level of protection against oil aerosols.   OSHA and CDC recommend N100 masks for health personnel dealing with patients with an airborne disease. They recommend N95 when dealing with patients with diseases transmitted by droplets and...PPE and gloves to prevent contagion from fomites.[https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2009/10/14/n95/](https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2009/10/14/n95/)",Airborne vs Aerosolised Transmission of Virus in relation to Coronavirus,2020-02-08 10:35:01,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0vlu2/airborne_vs_aerosolised_transmission_of_virus_in/

Hopefully it won’t get worse for the rest of the world, but it is reasonable to have concerns - The numbers are wrong.  We can disagree on the reasons why (conspiracy vs overwhelmed), but the numbers are much higher for infected and dead.  Personally I think it’s continuing to beat a dead horse.  China has admitted to their shortcomings, and it this point I don’t see what further discussion has to offer other than venting.I joined this sub to find out:- how people around the world are handling things - anything I can do to prepare - any updates on how the virus works, vaccines, transmission - because mainstream media is unreliable and has reduced coverage on the virus- because people would post on things I haven’t found online yet",This sub is becoming a circle jerk of fear mongering and panic,2020-02-08 11:54:59,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0wqbt/this_sub_is_becoming_a_circle_jerk_of_fear/

I’m gonna do my OWN research. With how bogged down and under funded hospitals already are, and how expensive it is to seek treatment in the US, people are right to be concerned. There are already thousands of regular influenza cases coming through NY hospitals on a daily basis, what do you think would happen if this virus spreads there? Hate to tell you, you can put the pieces together in the midsts of great confusion with the internet today. That’s what I am trying to do. I look at the actions of people, not their words.

Long asymptomatic carrier phase4. 15% of cases ""severe,"" which will be a problem just by number of hospital beds neededAlthough I'm looking for a way for that to add up to be ""being fine,"" I'm having a hard time imagining how some of the people on those flights were infected and infectious and spreading it when they were asymptomatic and now the people they gave it to are going through their long incubation period and pretty soon it's going to start popping here (I'm in the US.)

I mostly see other people saying, if that first scenario is true and we have an outbreak here, once people figure that out, it will be too late to plan, so just to be on the safe side, plan now,.

For example, the CDC recommends having enough food and water to last a household for at least 3 days. They could recommend that people should prepare. Make it clear to people in both their actions and their words that there are still a lot of unknowns with this virus, but we can safely conclude that it is worse than the flu. Let people know that the death rate, though just an estimate at this point, is much higher than the flu. Inform people that a quite large percentage of people with this virus will go into critical condition. Tell people to assume that someone in their community may already have the virus without symptoms or may have a mild case of it. This way, I think a lot of people will be even more consistent with hygiene and sanitation. As far as the US goes, make it clear that the risk to people in America is still low. But also make it clear that we can't predict the future so it's possible that the risk could increase.

Com- pared with non-ICU patients, patients who received ICU care had numerous laboratory abnormalities. These abnormali- ties suggest that 2019-nCoV infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocar- dia injury, hepatic injury, and kidney injury. These laboratory abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in pa- tients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection.The dynamic profile of laboratory findings was tracked in 33 patients with NCIP (5 nonsurvivors and 28 survivors). In the nonsurvivors, the neutrophil count, D-dimer, blood urea, and creatinine levels continued to increase, and the lymphocyte counts continued to decrease until death occurred. Neutro- philia may be related to cytokine storm induced by virus in- vasion, coagulation activation could have been related to sus- tained inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury could have been related to direct effects of the virus, hypoxia, and shock. The 3 pathologic mechanisms may be associated with the death of patients with NCIP.Until now, no specific treatment has been recommended for coronavirus infection except for meticulous supportive care.17 Currently, the approach to this disease is to control the source of infection; use of personal protection precaution to reduce the risk of transmission; and early diagnosis, isolation, and supportive treatments for affected patients. Antibacterial agents are ineffective. In addition, no anti- viral agents have been found to provide benefit for treating SARS and MERS. All of the patients in this study received antibacterial agents, 90% received antiviral therapy, and 45% received methylprednisolone. The dose of oseltamivir and methylprednisolone varied depending on disease severity. However, no effective outcomes were observed.This study has several limitations.","Summary of 138 hospitalised patients in Wuhan, China (case study)",2020-02-08 13:46:45,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0yb4b/summary_of_138_hospitalised_patients_in_wuhan/

A test Monday of the door handle of an infectious patient’s room revealed 2019-nCoV nucleic acids, indicating the presence of the virus.Qiu Haibo, another member of the team of experts, said there are several outcome scenarios for people with the virus. Those with robust immune systems may “self heal,” while other patients might develop upper respiratory problems without necessarily showing symptoms. Still others may experience only mild symptoms such as fever and fatigue.“Only a small proportion of patients will end up in critical condition,” Qiu said.",More video China spraying disinfectant on streets,2020-02-08 18:04:14,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f11svw/more_video_china_spraying_disinfectant_on_streets/

fh1j5z4,0.9903,0.0,"Think of this like a hierarchy.* World health* Country health* Commonwealth/State health* County/parish healthThe WHO is a health organization, but because they are a globally-focused group, their intentions are much more mired in bureaucracy, red tape, political infighting, money, and straight up global neoliberal political systems. They're primarily concerned with keeping the world's economy afloat, keeping the panic to a minimum, and moving to contain the illness at the behest of its members. It's a very large, slow-moving, lumbering elephant, and while it is effective at its job, it is coated in layers of administration. They have to deal with keeping relationships open between multiple governing bodies, the media, the larger business groups, think tanks, lobbyists...you name it. They don't really care about people. They don't care about ""us"" as much as they care about the system.The CDC is strictly focused on the United States and US-backed interests. While there is definitely layer upon layer of the same things as the above, the organization is more focused on keeping the federal-level entities, including the economy, the government, the military, and larger businesses, running smoothly while minimizing damage. They  don't really care about people as much as they do with keeping the economy moving, supplies moving, and the coordination of information between state departments of health. They'll also be trying to keep congress/the senate/the supreme court/the president healthy.Your state department of health and state surgeon general are focused on the state and the neighboring ones. It is primarily concerned with the health of the people in the counties under its control, as well as larger businesses in your state, lobbyists, corporate interests, and law enforcement. They are more concerned with your health, but are also concerned with the local economy and governing apparatuses.Your county health department is focused on local-level health and disease control. They have the interests of town-level and city-level businesses, but are also beholden to local government organizations (mayors, town councils, and selectmen). They care about your health the most because your health has the most impact on the things within their sphere of control.It's sort of the same thing with the UN. They don't care about car break-ins in your city or town. Their focus is global and largely economic. They do have ""soldiers"" but they're more of a peacekeeping force, and they're very hard to deploy because of the bureaucracy involved. The FBI wouldn't care about your car, either. Your state might, but not really. Your local police though? Sure. That's because Sergent Rachel lives next door with her husband and two kids. She has to care because your car break-in today might be her break-in tomorrow.***So to summarize, the WHO doesn't give two steamy-creamies in a truck stop bathroom about me, you, or your family. Neither does the CDC really. The people who kind of care about you are on the local level. The people who really care about you are your local officials and your community.***",I have watched every single WHO conference that there is but something is amiss....,2020-02-08 18:14:54,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f11xtt/i_have_watched_every_single_who_conference_that/

fh29ubr,0.9867,0.4939,"Everyone should be aware that although many articles are locked behind publishers' paywalls, it is almost always possible to get access to the content direct from the authors, who retain intellectual copyright to the content of academic papers. The publisher only owns the copyright to the layout/design - e.g in a pdf - but the author is still free to share, for instance, a word document of the article. This is often called a 'white paper'.There are a number of ways to obtain a white paper version of any published paper:1. Google Scholar - if you have found the paper through Google Scholar, you can nearly always read the abstract (a short summary of the article that will give you enough information to decide if you want to read the full detail) for free.Increasingly, more and more academic writing is 'open access' meaning that there is no charge to the reader to read the full article as well as the abstract. Open Access publishers charge academics to publish, rather than charging the readers to read.However, be aware that open access publishing is also very variable quality. Some 'predatory journals' will publish any rubbish if people pay them. Higher quality journals tend not to be open access as they need to pay expert editors and publishers to ensure content is kept high quality.If an article isn't open access, however, you can usually still, legally, get free access to it:2. If the full published article is behind a paywall, check if other versions are available. Google Scholar often links direct to white paper versions (which academics usually publish on their own websites) that can be downloaded for free.3. If there isn't a link to a white paper on Google Scholar, you can request one from the 'corresponding author' of the paper, whose name, institution and email address will be listed on the paper. It's also worth Googling them to find their Institute website as they may have uploaded a white paper version there.4. You can also - whether you are an academic or not - join ResearchGate, an academic version of LinkedIn - where white papers are posted, research is discussed and you will be able to link with researchers and ask questions.5. As a previous commenter notes, if you live close to an academic library, you can usually join and access their collections on request.Academic research is not nearly as hard to access as non-academics often think. If you want to read something it is nearly always just a case of asking.Academic publishing relies on editors, publishers, production editors, librarians and many other professionals who need to make a living to ensure that quality of work is kept high. Mostly, it makes very little if any profit.By all means lobby publishers to release more content to open access if you want to, but also please be aware of how legal access can be gained to virtually all academic content.

Multiple reliable sources like our Ministry of Health, a video of our groceries stockpile and even annoucements from our Prime Minister have repeated time and time again that our supplies are sufficient, IF USED RESPONSIBLY. Supplies are reaching shops and stores gradually3. Most places like schools, workplaces and offices are slowly up-ing measures. Twice daily temp taking and remote work/study arrangements are some of those in addition to the travel history quarantines.4. The Ministry of Health and the SG government are still advising us that while we have sufficient masks, we should only use surgical masks when we are sick.Of course that doesnt stop a good number of people from hoarding masks, hand sanitisers and groceries. There is also racism (SG Chinese =/= China Chinese) and bystander reports of verbal abuse against healthcare workers because of their proximity and likelihood of infection (????).All in all, us Singaporeans (esp the older generations) are quite spoiled thanks to a well-run government, and we infamously call ourself Complain Kings and Queens.

And while everything else before the Early Modern Age was a primitive joke, the clue is in the name of that they didn't even have iron tools; 0 AD was far more technologically advanced than the Bronze Age, at least from up here relatively it all looks the same of an entirely different world which we have nothing to do with and we had to destroy in order to create something entirely different.Populations which were overwhelmingly illiterate with virtually no education or skills, bureaucratic governance by a few fairly incompetent and heavily inbred people, fragile societies dependent on forms of slavery or serfdom etc etc...They collapsed because they *weren't* advanced or complex, not because they were. Depending on trade was particularly a vulnerability for them as there was no security for trade... which is why it didn't actually happen and their international trades were relatively tiny compared to their economy. They were perfectly capable of ""collapsing"" in on themselves by having a few bad seasons within the Malthusian Trap. Really we could say that they *didn't* collapse but instead *actually advanced*. Aspects of their societies failed and caused some short term suffering because those parts were backwards. Those weakest parts which died naturally were the fart-huffing parts who had been leaving us records claiming how glorious they were and just wow amazing ""civilisation"" and how their inbred king personally killed 10,000 people in a battle alongside the Thunder God, and all sorts of infantile writings. They got that dirt off their shoulders and advanced to more robust village economies.&#x200B;There can be serious consequences for this virus, and perhaps will even trigger a crisis worse than 2008/09.

But if any of y'all watch 郭文贵 (GuoWengui)'s video and live streams you will know what I'm talking about, or you can google gnews.org, it's his website. Take it with a grain of salt, but I'd say 95% of what he said have been proven true, you can dig into him a little deeper, but he has a lot of connections within the CCP. On top of that I've been working indirectly for/with a very large Chinese state owned company for many years, thus I have tons of personal connections in mainland China, plus we also have a production facility in Wuhan, so I definitely know a lot of insider's news. It's pretty clear at this point that coronavirus is originated from the P4 lab located in Wuhan, and it is definitely manmade there is no doubt about that. Whether it was released on purpose or not that's still debatable. I know this is gonna sounds crazy to most of y'all Western folks, but many respectable people in China and me believe that the virus was released on purpose to put an end or at least to delay the Hong Kong protest  as well as to resolve the conflict within the party (Xi's family vs Jiang's family) (note:HK issue is a huge pain in the ass for Xi, because it has been under Jiang's 'control' for the longest time), but of course it soon got out of control. Ever since Xi took over the 'presidency', the political climate has changed a lot, firstly he got rid of lots of his opponents during the anti corruption campaign, and that created fear within the party hence the reason why nobody is willing to speak up, secondly his efforts on cracking down opposing opinion and taking away the basic freedom of speech is absolutely devastating. The first reason along is enough to disincentivize the vast majority of political figures to act in their constituents' best interest, instead they will follow Xi's command and nothing else. This explains why the officials are slow on response, nobody was willing to shoulder the responsibility, consequently everything ended up on Xi's desk.

These viruses are far more  closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat CoVs,  particularly in the receptor binding domain (RDB) of the S protein. Most  importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV  (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat fecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has  typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and  uses the ACE2s from human, civet and Chinese horseshoe bat for cell  entry.

Either (HOPEFULLY) this ‘fizzles’ out (excuse the term) or a major shift is going to happen, especially here in the United States.People are going to realize what is going on if it gets more interesting as you say, and I feel it would cause mass chaos.The economy will drop, people will be isolating themselves (not necessary a bad thing IF infected or suspected of infection), but there are major problems that can/will occur if this shift occurs:Food shortages for one, also masks already being sold out, and of course the hysteria.People will be freaked out by anyone who gets in a two-feet radius of them.(Just as China is in worse conditions due to CCPs negligence of their own people)I live in Orlando, FL and my whole family works at the major theme parks (Universal, Walt Disney World, & Seaworld), which happen to be tourist central.

fh236vn,-0.9409,0.0,"Couldn't agree with you more on this. To me its rather obvious that this virus is extremely transmittable and that the numbers coming from China are way way way understated. Partly for the CCP to obstruct real numbers and avoid unrest within China and also because testing has been proven to be poor with inconsistencies with positive/negative cases all over the place.I too suspect that a person can be infected with this virus for weeks if not a month before showing symptoms and hence why there will be thousands if not tens of thousands of cases around the world now. For that reason I've chosen to keep a very tight circle in the last two weeks (No cases in NZ right now... yeah right)The good side of this is that the actual mortality rate is lower than even given by the CCP but this does not mean everything is rosy. Sadly I think this thing will spread, kill a few million people and cause economic shocks throughout the world over the coming months with the people of China and ultimately the CCP being the greatest victims.",My take on what's going on,2020-02-08 22:54:14,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f153sp/my_take_on_whats_going_on/

fh2feby,0.9746,-0.4939,"I work for a large global logistics company who has ~300 offices in 100+ countries. While we can ship anything to or from anywhere, Asia to US has always been our money maker, that’s the trade lane that we own.This has been particularly interesting to me for a few reasons, one of those because it will potentially (and in my opinion, most likely) have a significant impact on the global economy, and particularly my company. China is the largest exporter in the world, and the second largest importer, behind the US (who imports more from China than anywhere else). Needless the say the ripple effect of Chinese manufacturing being shut down will cripple the world. Hyundai has had to shut down manufacturing lines in S Korea because it can’t get parts from China. Honda, Toyota & Foxconn have all announced that there will be delays in their Chinese manufacturing plants as a result of this virus. It’ll be fascinating to hear what people say when Ford & Chevy announce that they can’t produce cars because they can’t get parts from China - “but wait, this is s’pose t’be made in Merica?!”I find there little reason to doubt that China is grossly under reporting confirmed cases and deaths. One interesting thing I heard though, was that if China came out and announced true number right off the bat, a TON of people would’ve immediately fled Wuhan, which would have made this much worse for everywhere else in the world. That being said, I’d still be curious to know the true numbers, though I don’t think that’ll ever happen. China is burning bodies immediately upon death.Last component that I find interesting is that there are roughly 85 million people in China that are currently quarantined. They can have 1 person leave the home every 3 days, in order to get food - that’s it. The introduction and acceptance of Martial Law “for the greater good” is happening globally. China is also their drone/surveillance program to find people & communicate with them. If you don’t know much about this, it’s insane - check it out. But acceptance of that is also happening. Give them an inch & they’ll take a mile. While there is value in the Quarantines/Surveillance now, next time they/someone else will be quicker to use it & have less of a need. But the general public will have already been warmed up to it. Then again next time & next..so on. I could talk about this quite substantially for a while but I’ll leave it here for now. It’ll be curious to see when/where this peaks. Only time will tell.
