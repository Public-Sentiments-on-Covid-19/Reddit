Example, for the 50c army, not trusting the CCP numbers **is** a conspiracy theory, Dr. Li’s claim **were** fake news, and they’re no different from claiming the thing is an American bioweapon made to hurt China- If you’re going to draw a line in the sand, it means you hold the truth. You can say for example that “refuting CCP numbers is wrong” only when you also have access to the real numbers directly from hospitals. Etc. Where does your unbiased knowledge stop?- Remember, we are in this situation today **because** moderators took on them to decide what fake news is, banned and censored people like Dr. Li ... I’m sure that most of them were just doing their job without malicious intent, like mods here. We’re supposed to learn from errors, not repeat them.- This is one of the only thread that gives voice to oppressed Chinese, and spreads some of their videos that are censored by the CCP, and that they took tremendous risks and courage to share.

fh2g8sa,0.0,-0.5994,Second letter惊悉李文亮医生于2020年2月6日21时30分因新冠肺炎病逝，不胜震悼。34岁的武汉中心医院眼科医生、武汉大学校友李文亮于2019年12月30日在微信群披露有关华南水果海鲜市场确诊7例SARS病例消息。2020年1月3日，武汉市公安局武昌分局中南路派出所传唤李文亮医生，称其传播＂不实言论＂，令其在《训诫书》上签字、按手印。自此李文亮及其他七名医生以＂造谣惑众＂罪名受到惩处。而1月中旬以来，新冠肺炎泛滥，导致1月23日武汉封城，成为全中国乃至世界性卫生危机。事态发展充分证明，李文亮等八位医生2019年12月底言论的正确性和必要性，但他们却受到训诫处罚，并一直未获平反。以上情实违背中华人民共和国宪法，应予追究。中华人民共和国宪法第二章第三十五条＂公民的自由＂条明文规定：＂中华人民共和国公民有言论、出版、结社、游行、示威的自由。＂第二章第五十一条说：＂中华人民共和国公民在行使自由和权利的时候，不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其他公民的合法的自由和权利。＂通观李文亮等八位医生的言行，完全符合宪法第三十五条、第五十一条精神，不仅没有损害国家、社会、集体利益和其他公民自由与权利，而且有力地维护了国家、社会、集体利益和他人之自由、权利，其以大众安危为己责，不顾自身利害之高风亮节正是警醒全社会，矫正当前自私虚伪之弊端的良药，正应大力赞颂与表彰。因而2020年1月初对八医生的惩罚完全是与民意相反的违宪行为，有关当局应当明确宣布：（一）承认前述作法完全错误，并以此为例，杜绝限制言论自由的作法，切实执行宪法第二章第三十五条、第五十一条。（二）撤销对八位揭示疫情的医生的处罚，公开对其道歉，赔偿其物质及精神损失。（三）鉴于李文亮医生率先披露重大疫情，乃嗣后大规模展开的抗疫之战的先驱；又鉴于李文亮医生亲历第一线，以身殉职，当追认李文亮医生为烈士，抚恤其家属。冯天瑜（武汉大学） 唐翼明 （华中师范大学）余品绶（武汉大学） 於可训 （武汉大学）郭齐勇 （武汉大学）邓晓芒（华中科技大学）李工真 （武汉大学）赵   林  （武汉大学）徐少华（武汉大学） 叶永刚（武汉大学）,Death of whistleblower ignites calls for political reform in China,2020-02-09 03:17:02,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f17do1/death_of_whistleblower_ignites_calls_for/

fh2kmwa,-0.9183,0.0258,"Ok so here's my take. We know from the Beijing-HK model/study that the highest risk are Chinese neighbors. So the peak of the outbreak will happen in China aroynd April, then Japan,HK, Taiwan, Singapore etc a month later(May). And we know coronaviruses die down in summer, June, July, August, should completely kill it everywhere with minimal impact to US, EU, Australia, NZ by the time peak happens.  We also know by worldwide pandemics there's a secobd wave that comes in Autumn, like the Spanish flu, swine flu, and avian flu they have a resurgence every year. If the April peak and worldwide spread occurs, a few important experts have said there will be a rebound in NCOV cases.  In the meantime, the antiviral studies should be done by April, that will affect mortality. And there are predictions that a vaccine could be found/passed through testing within 3 months to 12 months, with many saying it's highly likely they'll have one until Autumn. As such it's highly likely you will be able to vaccinate yourself for that trip.  Then there's the economic and social factors, in the summer the Olympics are going to happen in Japan, and many Chinese travel yearly to Japan in summer for the holidays. There is a lot of pressure on them to curve the spread, and improve self-image for maximum profit. So if you go in July you'll be safer because of temperatures, but more unsafe because of the high season influx of travelers, September might be worse with colder temps but better due to smaller volume of travelers. Overall this year it would be better to vacation regionally.  Lastly big oof on the kid, all data from SARS and NCoC2019 are horrible for pregnant women and newborns, 50% fatality, 80% pre-term births, 40% stillborns.

fh36asr,0.9849,0.0,"So this might be an unpopular opinion but I can't really fully blame the WHO on this one. Here are my thoughts on it, I'd love some discussion on this so please feel free to call me out.I don't think any critically thinking person actually expected China to be honest about their numbers. In fact there are unconfirmed reports that party and hospital officials are putting other causes of death on death certificates to avoid paper trials. China is being China and will carefully control the information that gets out and go to great lengths to make the 'official numbers' more favorable. What's worse, they're more than capable of doing so.If the WHO wants any cooperation from China they're going to have to practice some willful ignorance. This infection at current is primarily in China if the WHO wants to have boots on the ground, and get even days old numbers they're going to have to play by China's rules. With human lives at stake they need to pick their battles carefully, and to be honest I'm glad they're not choosing to make this issue the hill they die on. It's nice that we can sit here and pass opinion and judgement from the comfort of our internet connected devices but to those on the ground, to those more concerned with saving lives than how history will see them, I'm fine with it for the most part. My anger is towards China, not the WHO that seems to be stuck between pissing China off and losing all actionable information, and accepting that there are lies and continuing to have access to information and actual human cases. Again, I'd love to discuss this more so please don't hesitate to rebut me.",WHO knew?,2020-02-09 05:34:01,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f18oj7/who_knew/

My heart breaks for these sick people to be pulled from their families, not being able to say goodbye and knowing they may not see each other again.   Plus, these people must have a fever to be pulled out.  Last time I had a fever of 101 or higher, I was so miserable just trying to sleep in my own bed.  I can’t imagine having to go to a big hospital where I’m just left on a bed feeling all alone just surrounded by hundreds of sick strangers.  No one there to really care for you.   With the flu, there were days I couldn’t get up to even get something to drink.   And it’s possible some don’t even have the Corona virus right now...maybe it’s just another random bug that goes around this time of year.  Course they will probably get it after being in containment with others.  Then the police are the locking these poor people back into their apartments!  They can’t go out for food or to help a friend or neighbor they care for down the street.  Anything could happen and they couldn’t get out.  Plus, if they have been exposed to the virus by the family member they just removed, then chances are, they are all at risk of getting sick.   The police or whatever you call the men removing these people are also very likely to get sick considering how many health professionals supposedly got sick even when wearing a higher lever of protective clothing.  The people being forcefully pulled out might be coughing, sneezing or even spitting at these officers who seem to be wearing just plain on scrub masks.  The police are going from house to house possibly even spreading the disease!This is so horrible and I don’t agree with these tactics. However,  what can they do?  What is the right answer?

The saving grace is that spring temperatures tend to reduce infection transmission. Given that the Corona virus has been also infecting people in the southern hemisphere it has been postulated that there is a potential that this virus isn't seasonal. What this means is that flu infections have a problem mounting exponential because they tend to have a reduced R0 in the warmer months. But if the Corona virus is not affected by warmer weather then spread continues all year long. It is not just a ramp up and ramp down based on season but a constant ramp up until we come up with a way to combat it.","Ok, I'm sick of all the flu comparisons and people saying ""only 2% death rate!"".

Any meds that will stop or help stop nausea & vomiting, fever reducers, pain relievers. If you are lucky enough to have access to nebulizer & meds for it, those help keep airway open. Things like gatorade (you can get it in powder form to mix yourself here in the states), boxes of jello, rice - bland, easy to swallow, soft things to eat and drink. Pickle juice is awesome & works in a pinch for muscle cramps. Tums will help muscle cramps as well. Buy some cheap bedding & get an excess of it if you are expecting to care for more than one person. Things like laundry detergent as well - care giving usually requires a lot of washing. Things to busy the mind: books, movies, games, etc. Try to keep to a schedule if you are care giving. It’s tiring, stressful, and after a few days of it (if you are not used to it), it will be your lifesaver.

fh6ntfu,0.9947,0.1531,"I have a plan that I have already got into action that I will share with you now:1) Therapeutic doses of vitamin C can reduce fatalities from ARDS (Acute Respitory Distress Syndrome) what happens in late stage pneumonia. The best form is liposomal vitamin C. It is also the most expensive. The next best is buffered vitamin C which can be purchased in a bulk powdered form. I understand that while sick you can take 1000mg every 5 mins but please do your own research on dosage. (These are therapeutic doses and are not to be taken as a preventive.) I would also load up on vitamin C now so your body has some to use as stress can sap your reserves. I take anywhere from 1000mg to 3000mg a day.A link to how Vitamin C can help with ARDS[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYGoaW1gKQw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYGoaW1gKQw)2) Agarikon is a fungus that has amazing immune boosting abilities. It also targets the lungs specifically. It is very expensive and MUST be bio available to work so do your home work if you plan to buy this. I bought a pound of it a few days back and have been taking 1 tsp in my coffee every morning to load up. You can take up to 2 tsp daily or up it even more if you are unfortunate enough to catch this retched disease. Search Paul Stamets for more information. He has an excellent product line. 3) Andrographis is a bitter herb that also is used to fight lung infection both bacterial and viral. It is much less expensive BUT it is recommended to only be taken for up to 10 to 14 days. You can find this at many stores or online. I plan on using this if/when I catch this disease in conjunction with the other mentioned above.4) Umka Cold+Flu is my GO TO for anything throat or chest related. I have been using it for over 15 years with great success. The person who discovered the active ingredient was searching for a cure for tuberculosis, which I understand, is how he came to develop this syrup. Its made from some plant from South Africa. I plan on waiting till I have symptoms to start using this one.5) Elderberry Syrup would be my last line of defense. Just a few days ago I had a customer tell me that she had the flu last year and for some reason there was a shortage on Tamiflu and her doctor recommended Elderberry Syrup which she swore by. It is also safe for children, there are children versions available.6) Willard Water and or Trace Minerals added to water will make the water more absorbable and will help with dehydration. Other than that, there are expectory breathing exercises (pranayama) that can help clear out the lungs but I don't know too much about that. My roommate is training to be a yoga therapist and told me she would practice with me. It is called Bastrika and I'm sure a quick YouTube search would yield a plethora of information.Good luck everyone!",How to prepare for sick loved ones?,2020-02-09 09:52:36,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1c6i8/how_to_prepare_for_sick_loved_ones/

No, they just took a generic thing and made it cheaper and the only reason they might be sole suppliers of that stuff now is because they outcompeted the others for price.China is basically cheap because of prices of recources and regulations regarding workers etc.Last thing we should do is worry about medical supplies, if there is a shortage there will be a price spike and youll have a dozen companies setting up a production line within a week to cash in on the higher prices.Yes, monetarily if the shop stays shut in China there will be huge implications, but I couldn't give a shit if multinationals that moved there because things are cheap as fuck cannot get their stuff to customers anymore. That is basically the price they pay for setting up shop there to get a few extra bucks for their investors.I couldn't care less if these investors lost huge amounts of net worth and dividends for a few quarters, that is simply the price they pay for their ever increasing net worth and dividends, they succesfully pushed all publicly owned companies all over the world towards China so they could get more growth, more money. They literally made their own bed and I hope they get to sleep in it.Less cars.. Wow, real crisis there. People can't buy shiny new cars. Meanwhile i've driven a 1500 buck car for the last 5 years. Less new phones and phone shortages?! great for the environment, whats the ponit of buying a new phone anyway? Over the last 5 years there have been no real improvements to them anyway apart from a better camera, a bigger screen? Wow some selfie people will now have to wait to upgrade their megapixels another 15%!~There will be a delay to the adoptation of 5G!!. Wow real crisis again, now instead of watching 4k netflix everywhere ill still have to do it on the television instead of on my phone!. I will have to wait to download stuff a minute longer.I mean, lets be truly honest. China makes almost entirely crap that no one truly needs but still buys. Investors and multinationals will hate it because they can't fullfill the consumption craze in the world. But the environment will benefit and perhaps people will benefit too now they won't be able to buy crap they did not need anyway.","True? “Our supply lines – especially in things like medicine are DEPENDENT now on China...There are many many things (saline bags, cardiac IV meds, antibiotics, blood pressure meds, diabetes meds...) that are only made in China.”",2020-02-09 10:17:29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1ck7u/true_our_supply_lines_especially_in_things_like/

If there was some evidence of a local/state/federal conspiracy, then all bets are off.I believe this is a notable difference between America and China in this scenario. While the US could absolutely squash any uprising of protesters, the infringement on our constitutional rights as citizens would temper (though likely not stop) the subsequent actions of the state against her citizens.

The US is also way less population dense and people typically don't rely much on crowded public transportation except when flying. Americans also will not rely on traditional remedies (although the anti-vaxx, essential oils, healing crystal crowd exists). I don't think we would need that kind of containment measure.Here's what I mean by hygienic, BTW. In virtually every American public establishment and every government building, there is running water and soap. You don't get that in China because if you leave something out to use for free, people will take it. Soap is rarely supplied except at international destinations where there are expected to be tourists. Further, American markets and slaughter practices are incomparably more hygienic. There are actual standards, inspections, and you know where each animal came from. Any restaurant needs to be licensed and needs to undergo random inspections. China doesn't have that. Also note that this applies to China AS A WHOLE. I don't mean those international students with western educations. I don't mean those sophisticated businessmen. I don't mean those professionals in healthcare. I am sure those people are just as clean, if not more so, than the average American.

We haven't been in contact with like anyone and haven't gone anywhere so I'm not sure how I could have picked up this flu.

I agree the correct way to estimate mortality rate is  deaths/(deaths+recoveries)= 813/(813+2685)=0.23. But that number is unpalatably high, so they will switch to this calculation method only when they get enough plausible recoveries. Meanwhile, they just need to keep adding 5000 new cases for every 100 deaths to keep deaths/totalCases at 2%. If they run low on new cases, using false positives will do nicely.  False positives eventually become recoveries  unless the patients catch something in the hospital. However, it is worth pointing out that if all of the 6196 currently live but severe cases die, they will need another 309,800 new cases to keep deaths/totalCases at 2%. So there is quite a drama unfolding in the numbers. The likely event is that they will build camps for ""mild cases"" into which people who unluckily tested positive are forced despite not having symptoms.",Coronavirus fatality rate?,2020-02-09 12:16:55,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1ed2k/coronavirus_fatality_rate/

fh5vttm,-0.9355,-0.6705,"Theres a lot of asterisks coming with that number that make it hard to determine. First, it takes longer for a person to be considered ""recovered"" as opposed to how long it might take to die. Second, the cases especially coming out of Wuhan, even if we believe the chinese numbers for now, are gonna be more severe cases that require hospitalization, as there's not enough resources to treat those with mild or moderate symptoms. Third, we have to take the precarious healthcare situation in Wubei into account. Pneumonia is a serious condition that can be life threatening, but can be handled and treated nowadays. Again, not the case in Wuhan, where they are turning patients away that would get treated otherwise. Nevermind the problem of secondary infections and hygiene.If you want a conclusive mortality rate, you will need to wait how the patients in other chinese cities, and especially abroad develop. For now, it seems that most of those people are doing well, in Wuhan they probably wouldn't even have been tested due to the lack of resources, thus not going into the statistic.Epidemiological parameters are complex and depend on many variables. If you had let's say, a Cholera outbreak in Germany, the mortality would be very very low. If you had that same outbreak in a country with a poor healthcare system, or if it was so large that the system is overwhelmed (as is the case in Wuhan), that number would skyrocket.",Coronavirus fatality rate?,2020-02-09 12:16:55,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1ed2k/coronavirus_fatality_rate/

fh55f7e,-0.8036,-0.6705,"The case-fatality-rate is impossible to predict under current circumstances. The number of total cases is likely highly underreported (due to limited diagnostics and low symptomatic cases) and diagnosed cases are biased towards severe cases as diagnostics are more likely to be performed on hospitalized cases. Also, recovery takes most often longer than death, and is not yet clearly defined (i.e. symptom-free, or diag-negative?). Additionally, it is not necessarily inherent to the virus, but also dependent on hospital infrastructure and capacity, diagnosis and treatment algorithms, public behavior, comorbidities ...The short answer is: We cannot know currently.

fh6byo5,-0.7207,-0.6705,"You're getting it. You really can't conclude the true mortality prognosis 1. of someone diagnosed with the disease or 2. of the disease generally until you consider cases where the person has recovered. Given our current understanding of the disease, it usually takes around 1-2 weeks after hospitalization if someone's going to die. Hence, if you only look at cases say, 1-5 days old you will not have a great grasp of mortality.On the flipside of the equation, as testing usually only occurs when people have serious symptoms, we probably miss more mild cases that resolve themselves on their own. So if you're trying to ask the mortality of people contracting the disease generally vs. those with serious symptoms you'll have a different answer.Thirdly, the prognosis for serious cases probably depends significantly on the number of cases in an area, as medical care available will decline at some point. If a substantial number of people contract the disease in one area, mortality rates for those cases will increase as total cases will exceed available hospital capacity, leading to substandard or no care.Finally, all numbers from Wuhan/CCP should be subject to some scrutiny, as testing is limited, many of those who die from pneumonia are not recorded as such, and there is a substantial desire for China to appear in control.",Coronavirus fatality rate?,2020-02-09 12:16:55,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1ed2k/coronavirus_fatality_rate/

I've seen people panicking to get on a rare bus a few times.However, Macau is actually pretty pretty calm and they are confident that they will economically recover after the spread ends. There hasn't been any new cases since Febuary 4, so people are more and more positive. The only virus incident that worries them are the new cases in Zhuhai, the neighboring Chinese province. This is pretty suprising because per capita, Macau has more cases than Hong Kong due to its tourism industry.I'm impressed by how the government distributed limited-per-person mask supplie as a form of panic control. Toilet paper is still available as well. People still shop around in the stores that are open as usual, but not as many.

In the old days we used platforms like Usenet, the various IRC networks, etc. There was very little censorship, the “net” was often a place of flame wars, rumors, innuendo and many other things. These systems weren’t money makers, in and of themselves, they were merely part of the tapestry of the early internet, often maintained and supported by a combination of volunteers, educational institutions and internet service providers. Today, these modern platforms, with all their identity data and infrastructure, with their multitude of modalities and billions of users, are all about money. Most of these systems are nothing more than glorified message boards, but their centralized ownership gives the companies in question massive power, power that runs contrary to the very design and original purpose of a distributed “internet” (it’s purpose and function declared in its very name).This is why the modern internet has become so insidiously evil; centralized “cloud” providers, which are nothing more than hosting companies attempting to collect as many people’s services, applications and data, as they can. They wrap those services in proprietary interfaces, orchestration tools and abstractions that ensure that the customer is beholden to them, forever. And they collude: from DNS infrastructure to payment systems, they don’t like you, for a reason they all agree upon, and they can shut you down.There’s nothing cloud about “the cloud”; there’s nothing social about “social networking”; there’s nothing accurate or organic about “search”.The Internet of 2020 is a technical marvel, but in all the ways that matter, the internet of 1994 was vastly superior.

On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.",Are US hospitals testing pneumonia patients?,2020-02-09 16:27:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1hzab/are_us_hospitals_testing_pneumonia_patients/

fh6tuy1,-0.9993,-0.3769,">(AI, the internet of things, transhumanism, electric cars... all gone!)They'll be delayed, but *far* from ""all gone."" Actually, the most important innovation to AI will *benefit* from a Chinese collapse (it's unrelated to the cost of electronics, and that's all I'll say on that matter), but it's best to wait and see on that one. Beyond that, I've written a bit about what's likely to happen...____________________I've been mentioning this elsewhere.What happens next really depends on which demographic is most affected by coronavirus. China's probably screwed either way, but if coronavirus *does* live up to the hype and spreads around the world, geopolitics will become radically different within just a few years. And like I said, it all comes down to the most victimized demographic. If it's the Boomers (those 65 and older), then the main power bloc for the CCP is finished. Much of the Chinese youth don't really support the CCP, and the CCP knows this. This is for a variety of reasons of course. Just with at Tiananmen, there are likely millions upon millions who despise how the Chinese ""Communist"" Party has totally betrayed communist principles and followed the lead of all the other failed socialist movements in the process, somehow becoming the worst of both worlds: neither democratic and open to the populace nor revolutionary in spirit, thus basically becoming this bizarro mixture of capitalism and statism under a communist flag. The Tiananmen protesters, by and large, were student radicals, demsocs, and whatnot who hated China's new market-oriented direction, and that sentiment hasn't gone away. Likewise, there are also millions and millions of Chinese youths who think the whole communist experiment as a whole was rotten from the start, hence why the CCP liberalized the economy but kept hold onto power themselves. It wouldn't take much to incite them to want to overthrow the CCP either, and at least for a time, these two factions could work together. The elder generation are the ones most in support of the CCP. They're the ones who saw China go from literal pissbasket-tier poverty all the way to having a standard of living (in cities) equal to that of Western nations. Considering the miserable state China was in beforehand, it's clear that the CCP is doing something right. It's easy to forget just *how* sick China was before 1948, after all; the Great Leap Forward was the worst of them, but it was not the first famine or disaster in 20th century China that killed tens of millions; only the first under the Communist Party. And most who lived through it probably would've said that the Sino-Japanese War and Chinese Civil War were just as bad, if not worse, because of how dire and disunited China was during those times. Moving on from *that* is exactly why the CCP has their support.There are more elders than youths, which is a big problem in China and is something that'll eventually drag down the economy (see: Japan). A lingering ""filial piety"" culture isn't helping (though it's not as strong as it once was), meaning that you tend to defer to elders. Lose the 65+ crowd and you'd probably lose a *massive* power bloc for the CCP, introducing a shitload of instability almost overnight. Maybe not enough to throw off the CCP, but certainly enough to force them to extreme measures (which *may* include democratic reforms, though obviously heavily controlled with Pakistan-tier ""democracy""). If the USA were smart and hadn't lost international support, we'd be able to force other nations to maintain the travel & trade bans with China beyond the coronavirus pandemic in an attempt to force the CCP out, but that's probably off the table at this point.China's in a pickle, though. Losing the youth will always be worse than losing the elderly because the youth is where you get the majority of your national productivity, and they're the ones who support the elderly. Lose the youth, and the elderly get choked and have to rely on the government for more assistance, which becomes tragic if the government collapses. If coronavirus attacks the youths (in a manner similar to H1N1), then the CCP might initially have a much *stronger* grip on power since the generation that doesn't trust them will be thinned out, but China *needs* as many able-bodied youths as it can get. Otherwise, its labor market will be hollowed out and its economy will be unable to function. Its military have a smaller pool of candidates to boot, reducing their already pitiful power projection. This on top of medical costs being astronomical trying to deal with this, plus the loss of business revenue as a result of these shutdowns and quarantines.There's no way for China to win this; coronavirus *will* fuck them up if it deteriorates. Their only recourse is their massive population being used to buffer the effects, but losing 10,000,000 people is *going* to have a negative effect no matter what, especially in a rising power. It's not much better in the United States of course. The Republican party's main power base is the 65+ crowd, and if that's the main death demographic of coronavirus, I don't need to tell you what happens next. If even 1 million Boomers were to die of coronavirus, the 2020 election would basically be handed to the Democrats; if 10 million died, the GOP would be unviable in more than half the country for decades. Likewise, if coronavirus mainly targets the youths (the main demographic for Democrats), we'd see the Dems lose just by double-digits in even Democratic strongholds. The loss of able-bodied youths means the economy takes a massively drastic hit (and the elderly now have far less support & social security) and the military has to go on high alert because they won't be able to afford losing any more fresh blood.It'd just be a pisser all around. But the USA is in a better state to recover; the most that'd change with us is one party being reinforced for a decade or two and/or an economic depression, which would obviously have some very noticeable effects, but wouldn't be ""fall of Washington DC"" bad.",Things are about to get weird!!!,2020-02-09 18:19:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1jfp6/things_are_about_to_get_weird/

fh7f9xy,0.7953,0.0,"The Singapore government has been really transparent with the citizens and doing its best to reassure. You can view the Singapore Ministry Of Health website for latest updates. The last I checked, 6 were discharged. However, More have been admitted also and more drastic measures have been taken:- some companies do split-ops (half work from home for 2 weeks, half go to office. This gets rotated for the month)- for entrances to some buildings , people must queue up and have their temp taken before they can enter. So you can see Long queues of people forming to take their temp. Obviously, it is inconvenient but building managements are using this as a measure. - offices and schools checking if anyone has gone to China in last month - fill up a declaration formI Guess in some workplaces people just see this as an inconvenience. At the main working area of Singapore today, people are just going about life as normal. Some parents still send their kids to school , others have stopped as a precaution. Jus taking it day by day. Sanitizers and masks are out of stock at most places. The supermarket has imposed a buying limit (given the crazy rush few days back - people were stocking up in masses and others were getting angry).I think we can get a better gauge of the situation in a few weeks to a months time. In the meantime, just keeping calm and carrying on . Life goes on, people still need to work to earn money.... we still need the economy to keep going ...The government is reassuring so that gives a sense of calm to people.

The phone doesn't consistently move with the coughing.  It does sometimes.  The coughing all seems to come from about the same spot.  This was odd.2. Why does this patient even *have* a phone when doctors are reportedly having theirs confiscated?  I'd think at this point China would be doing something about hospitals even having service.3. Why bag the body, put the blanket on it, leave, come back, and take the body?  It would take multiple people to do the bagging, right?4. Why put the blanket back on?5.

SARS caused the China GDP to drop from 11.1 to 9.1 percent in one quarter alone.Modern civilization is interconnected -- not only between countries, but far-flung industries.China isnt manufacturing. Wuhan handles 1.5 million shipping containers a year. Two billion tons of cargo flow through Wuhan's port. Any country, major supplier or company that sources goods or coal, crude oil, steel, or fertilizer is royally fucked. Travel and jet fuel companies already feel it. Major shipping companies have already announced blank sailings.Best case, pie-in-the-sky scenario is that we go back to BAU next week which still means significantly higher prices for any country that is a China trade partner. . . basically most of the civilized world.Wrap your head around that. This will hit every nation in two months time because that's how long it takes to move through the system. The longer the shut down, the greater the pain. Even if they resumed today, it would still cause problems. We are talking at least a month of disruption in the supply chain.This affects retailers around the globe (Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target) in addition to shipping companies (and UPS, DHL, FedEx), plus every other company that services those accounts. Every airline with routes to SE Asia is screwed. Every company that services those airlines, especially jet fuel suppliers, is screwed. This could very well push us into a global depression or collapse. There isn't any way to fix this either because no one can just step in and pick up the slack.Imagine if Amazon stopped all business for one month. Think about all the companies that would go under because they are wholly dependant on Amazon for the lion share of their sales, or processing of payments, etc. Now think how long it would take one company to recover from that.Got a good picture? Good, now multiply that by every major retailer, shipping, transport, electronics, travel, airline, and packaging company in the world and realize there is no alternative for them. They can't buy parts or product anywhere else in any remotely sizable volume. Consider all the countries selling raw materials to China. Hell, we won't be able to manufacture medical equipment without components if and when governments start building hospitals.So when you say ""maybe in Wuhan"" understand that those 1.5 million shipping containers are not going on to ships, not being loaded onto trucks, not being delivered to manufacturers, not being stocked in retailer's warehouses, and not hitting your store shelves.",A couple days ago I posted details about the supply chain disruptions in China triggering a global economic disruption which would begin accelerating today (2/10 in China).

Chinese and now other Asian stocks are dropping without recovery. We already know that travel stocks have fallen, but so has energy and commodities. China has pumped as much as $250 billion dollars into the markets, prohibited short selling, and relaxed its credit for its banks, yet their markets are still failing. And none of this address the logistics problem OP has mentioned, nor can stop transmission of the virus in worker environments. If any of you were around during one of the last recessions, in the US we had a ""flight to safety"" from stocks to real estate. Then real estate collapsed. In a ""flight to safety"", nothing is safe.Also. Dunno how many of your were around 20-30 years ago, but all the business magazines then were telling us how China was growing, while US was not. I now know that this ""growth"" was due to China taking on massive amounts of debt for infrastructure projects that went nowhere, empty high-rise apartments, empty cities, and those abandoned shopping malls. These properties are kept on bank loan books at \*full value\* and have not been written off yet. As China's epidemic bankrupts businesses and their stock market, real estate may be next. If a business can't pay off its loans, how's a bank going to recuperate its money by selling stock and property collateral nobody wants?I see US stocks ready for a correction (we had a severe drop several days ago), but the markets eventually returned from previous epidemics. I disagree about a global recession, or at least a recession in the US. China's wages have been increasing, to the point where China is no longer the world's cheapest labor -- even Chinese companies were using labor overseas. Trump's trade war inadvertently caused US businesses to postpone investment in China, which helped reduce the shock of this epidemic. Much of the US economy is service-based, and we produce our own food.

I agree with your assessment: mortality rate is almost certain to be below 2%, and the major risk to advanced economies is due to burden on health care systems if we can't slow spread enough. I'm still pretty intimidated by the possibilities. The current mortality estimate might be something like an upper bound for a cohort of patients that don't receive adequate treatment, due to Wuhan's overwhelmed healthcare system. The (much lower) mortality rate for international cases is probably something like a lower bound for a cohort of patients receiving tip-top medical care from the foremost experts in their respective countries. It's worth thinking about what the figures might be in, say, Africa, or even in the West if things go really pear-shaped and we run out of hospital beds.","Please, take a step back, take a deep breath and use some common sense and re-evaluate what you know",2020-02-09 22:17:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1m9dd/please_take_a_step_back_take_a_deep_breath_and/

The cruise ship is likely to give us a lower bound for the mortality rate under best possible care. Singapore will give us a more accurate R in a modern developped metropole. That being said, you take *forever* to die from that thing and it will take a good while to have a sizable sample set of cases who have gone through the full progression of the virus. We simply cant say anything concrete about CFR right now.Last point: Due to its highly infectous nature especially in poorer countries, the actual CFR will be a lot higher then the one under ideal conditions we have for people outside China right now. A sizable portion of cases need intensive care and if they dont get it well... You see picture. You cant assume ideal conditions for patients now, who are tested early and get good care and extrapolate from there.

fh7pa3h,-0.5083,0.0,"\>  It seems nobody agrees on a single thing about this virus.I don't expect them to. It's a new virus and it hasn't been a week since the end of the Chinese Lunar holidays. When Chinese workers return to work, we'll find out much more about the virus. Unfortunately.Anyway, I think it's important to know \*how\* viruses can be transmitted. Don't want to use term most people don't understand. fwiw, None of these terms in the article use ""airborne"".>Experts explained the three types of possible transmission vectors for the coronavirus:  >  >Direct transmission (confirmed), infection caused by inhalation of air near an infected individual who sneezes or coughs  >  >Contact transmission (confirmed), infection caused by touching an object that has virus-infected droplets, and then touching the mucus membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes  >  >Aerosol transmission (disputed), infection caused by inhaling the virus, which has mixed with droplets in the air to form aerosols that float for longer periods of time, as long as several daysSo that would explain why a victim of the virus who sat \*next\* to a carrier in a plane caught the virus, while those several rows away did not (some viruses in airplanes \*will\* transmit this way).Still, if you're in a city or county that has a known case (I'm in Santa Clara county, where we have two confirmed cases), I don't see why you should take ALL precautions that aren't inconvenient to you, especially since they also prevent the seasonal cold and flu. You can certainly avoid contact and aerosol transmission by wearing a face mask, scarf, bandanna, etc., and wash your hands more frequently. If you don't have to go to a public place, don't go. I would even avoid take-out food prepared by others, and raw food, at least for now.[https://mothership.sg/2020/02/aerosol-transmission-coronavirus/](https://mothership.sg/2020/02/aerosol-transmission-coronavirus/)","Coronavirus NOT airborne, Australian Health Officials claim",2020-02-09 23:50:37,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f1n599/coronavirus_not_airborne_australian_health/
