fj695gx,-0.9295,0.0,"Here you have a translation of the article ROME- while we talk on the phone to analyse the spike in COVID-19 cases, professor Massimo Galli - primary doctor and infectiologist at the Sacco hospital of Milan - is in the hospital ward, forced to interrupt our conversation 3 times to answer colleagues asking him permission to send him more severe patients: ""what you're hearing in real time is worth more than my answers. We're in a full emergency. Yes, I am concerned.""How do you explain this sudden spike in contagions?""What we were hoping wouldn't happen has happened. The virus eluded surveillance cryteria. The epidemic has conquered a part of Italy. We find ourselves in need to handle a big number of patients with important clinical pictures. Something serious is happening, not just here in Italy but also in Germany and France, that could soon find themselves in the same situation as us, even though I hope they won't. We're treating a growing number of challenging patients.""What caused this sudden spike in cases?""The clinical pictures suggest the infections aren’t recent. It's likely that in the hospitalized patients between two to four weeks have passed between the infection and the development of more serious symptoms, from simply needing to be helped with oxygen to needing artificial respiration.""Some people have compared this disease to influenza. Incautious comparison?""Who tried to spread tranquillity, and I get them, hasn't considered the potentialities of this virus. In 42 years I've been a doctor I've never seen a strain of flu capable of upsetting the infective diseases wards' activity. The situation is frankly one of emergency from the perspective of sanitary organisation. It's the equivalent of a tsunami when it comes to the number of patients with serious patologies hospitalized at the same time. I'll describe the day of friday, before the new wave of cases had arrived. In Lombardy there were 85 beds occupied by intubated patients with COVID-19, a large part of the total available beds, not counting the risk of contagion to which doctors and nurses are exposed. An abnormal workload.""Have the measures taken by the italian government worked?""All that was possible has been done and now we have to keep going with the restrictions, trying to avoid crowding as much as we can. Unfortunately the virus arrived in italy before we had started blocking its way with the ban on flights from China. The arrival in our country is previous to that, it was already spreading in mid to late January judging from the spike of cases in the last days. They're mostly old contagions, mainly from the start of February, some of them even older than that.""Does it mean that this disease develops slowly from contagion?""Exactly. It has different phases and it peaks in severity even 7-10 days after the insurgence of the first symptoms. It's very likely that behind all of the more serious cases there are just as many others, just not as serious. To use a typical term of epidemiology, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Even the best sanitary organisations in the world, and we are one of them, risk not being able to withstand such an impact.""Italy looks split in two as of right now. In the north the emergency, in the centre and south apparently calm. How's that?""It could’ve happened anywhere and it wouldn't have made any difference. Someone, perhaps a single person, arrived in Codogno and spread the infection without anybody realising that. A casual phenomenon with the aggravating circumstance of the cluster starting in a hospital. I hope what happened in Lombardy, an infected patient showing up at the ER and not being recognised due to the WHO suspect cases' classification cryteria already being outdated, won't happen again. I think that thanks to this precedent hospitals are now more alerted and cautious.""What are your predictions?""Most of the patients recover but there are a lot, too many, to assist. Metropolitan areas have remained out of the red zones as of right now, let's hope they stay that way.""EDIT: the text of the article is now different in some of its parts from what I originally translated to English.","Milan doctor: ""clinical picture does not suggest that the infections are recent.

Otherwise a for-profit practice will only take you if they run a credit check and you have a shining credit score or are willing to put down a deposit first. $$$$$$ comes before human beings after all. Gotta make those quarterly earnings to keep wall street fat cats happy. Check if your state has expanded Medicaid. If they have check if you meet the qualifications. If you do sign up for it ASAP. Don't be deterred by it being a public assistance program. In my state you get 5 MCOs / Managed Care Organizations to choose from like Humana, Aetna, etc just like HMOs and in my experience it's even better than the so-called 'Cadillac' HMO or PPO plans. I go to 4 different specialists and haven't been denied pre-authorization for any of them, and am on 3 different nonlisted/noncovered drugs that got special coverage with preauthorization. In some states Medicaid MCOs are sparse in network coverage though. But still, if you're uninsured it's still better than nothing at all. And in most states it won't cost you anything except maybe postage to mail back paperwork - though most states let you submit everything online. Some states do charge co-pays and premiums but it's still NOWHERE near as expensive as even employer provided health insurance.If you are NOT in a state with expanded Medicaid, you could TRY to get on it by filing for SSI if you have a chronic condition that you believe impairs your ability to do ADL / Activities of Daily Living and also impairs SGA / Substantial Gainful Activity. But it'll take at least 2.5-3 years to get approved - if you get approved -- unless you're a quadriplegic Helen Keller.

So distribution centers for retailers see increased demand and increase their own ordering on a 1-2 day delay. That moves a bit more slowly, but we're still talking the retailer's internal supply chain being traveled in less than a week.As soon as the panic truly settles in, people will be frantically buying up anything they will use in the hopes of riding it out. Can't find canned goods? Take home a hundreds packages of Oreos. I'm not kidding, people stop being rational as soon as they realize they have no control over their own food supply. We've got a week until stuff is out and employees have no idea when more will be coming in. A week later, stores will hit that weird point where they don't have enough stock for people to bother shopping there, which means they won't move stock, which means they will have some really odd stock they can't sell because nobody shops there. On the other side of this, locations all along the supply chain (from farms to processing/packaging, distribution, inventory, and retail store) will be facing the strain of employees being unable or unwilling to work due to CV. Lots of people will take sick days or personal leave to try and figure it out, and managers everywhere are ready to pull the plug if they feel they need to shut a location down. Somewhere in the middle, we've got individual states panicking about the virus traveling. That means checkpoints, and traffic, and delays in the actual process of distribution. The system becomes less efficient.

Many see themselves in Li, a regular citizen who was punished by police for trying to speak out.

If it becomes a  pandemic, the questions  are, how bad will it get and how long will it  last? The case fatality  rate – the proportion of cases that are fatal –  has been [just over 2%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/01/coronavirus-victims-profile-outlier-impact-cases), much less than it was for Sars, **but 20 times that of seasonal flu**.Dr Jonathan Quick also said Feb 12:>There  is no reason to panic. Thus far, the US outbreak is small and   well-controlled. Despite the public concern about the new coronavirus,   based on current information, **it is extremely unlikely that in the U.S.,  it would develop into anything close to the 2018 flu.**  The CDC estimates  in the U.S. that the 2017-2018 seasonal influenza  caused 48.8 million  influenza illnesses, 959,000 hospitalizations, and  79,400  influenza-associated deaths. And the annual cost of seasonal  influenza  in the U.S. is over 90 billion. The seasonal flu vaccine does  not fully  protect against all flu strains, it nonetheless  substantially reduces  both the risk of infection and the risk of  succumbing to the flu if  infected.

Many parents saw the action to remove thiomersal—in the setting of a perceived increasing rate of autism as well as increasing number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule—as indicating that the preservative was the cause of autism. The scientific consensus is that there is no evidence supporting these claims, and the rate of autism continues to climb despite elimination of thiomersal from routine childhood vaccines. Major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization, as well as governmental agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders",Epidemics expert: The worst-case scenario is likely,2020-03-01 03:07:11,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbsmox/epidemics_expert_the_worstcase_scenario_is_likely/

When that decline will commence and how fast it will be for this virus is an unknown.Why show future figures if this is not accurate then?Because it's interesting to see how fast exponential growth can pan out and how rapidly that could affect us. I was surprised myself when I first made this formula that decently matched the existing growth and then extrapolated it forwards.However if this stops growing exponentially fairly soon then that 7th April date where the entire planet is infected could actually mathematically be pushed back by months or years.&#x200B;Notes: * the final day's data on the chart is ongoing for today so the final data is thus far unknown but included anyway. * My ""actual total cases"" values may be off slightly due to how I extract the data from BNO news. It's not significant enough to undermine this data.* Does not include Hong Kong. Don't roast me. I just didn't use Hong Kong when I started extracting this data a month ago as it was too geographically close to China that I felt it disrupted the data from examining the international growth. There's nothing political about this decision.* Sundays have historically resulted in data that is lower than or doesn't increase at the rate of previous days.

It’s a very serious situation, and downplaying it makes a lot of people have a false sense of security. The virus itself is scary, but the impact it’s having on the world economy is terrifying. People should at the very least be preparing mildly for an outbreak near them. If you haven’t already gathered some sort of supplies, or talked about the potential for this virus to be of concern to you and your family, you should certainly start. It’s a WORLDWIDE virus, and it’s spreading very quickly. This is not intended to spread fear or incite panic in people, but this is the kind of clear and unfiltered warning people need to hear. Prepare your family for a few weeks to a months worth of isolation, and talk to each other about the worst case scenario so that you’re prepared. If it comes to that point, and I hope it doesn’t, you’ll be ahead of the issue and not struggling to comprehend the possibility of it taking place.

In addition, more cases and deaths were confirmed at the Cheongdo Daenam Hospital, where Lee Man Hee and other senior members of the church attended the funeral of Lee Man Hee’s older brother.Under the current circumstances in South Korea, people are obligated to voluntarily undergo examination to prevent the further spread of the virus. However, the defendants are refusing to be examined, and did not take action to have the church fully cooperate with authorities to prevent the further transmission of the Corona19 virus.The list of worshipers who attended the Shincheonji masses that was submitted to local governments were found to have some members omitted from the list, even though they were present at the mass and other lists had false names listed. This has raised suspicions that the church is purposely interfering with the health authorities’ business.Such acts by the defendants constitute as murder and causing injury under criminal law, and they were also accused of violating the law of prevention of infectious diseases by submitting false lists of church members. Park Won Soon, Mayor of Seoul, released a statement on their legal action against the Shincheonji church.&#x200B;>**The prosecution should carry out a swift and strict investigation into the leadership of Shincheonji, who is in charge of this incident, to ensure that a severe punishment is handed out to them.**  — Park Won Soon",The City Of Seoul Is Taking Legal Action Against the Shincheonji Church For Murder and Violation of the Law,2020-03-01 04:20:18,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbtb4x/the_city_of_seoul_is_taking_legal_action_against/

It has saved more lives across the millenniums than any protocol, government, hand sanitizer, doctor, or soldier. It is in us for a reason.  Let that little voice inside you that says something is not right have it’s day. History shows that voice to be pretty wise.","Stores Are Running Out of Cleaning Products Due to COVID-19 Fears.

For example, on Friday,  before the new wave of cases arrived in Lombardy, there were 85 beds  occupied by patients intubated for Covid-19, that’s a significant share  of those available.”    Authorities in the Lombardy region, where 552 people are infected,  have asked for a hospital to be made available solely for treating  coronavirus and to be able to hire retired doctors and nurses to help  with the workload.There have been 29 deaths in Italy, the latest eight victims ranging  between the ages of 79 and 90. Those who have died so far were suffering  other serious health problems. Some 401 people have been hospitalised –  105 of them in intensive care – and 543 are at home. Fifty people have  recovered.Schools in Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, where there are 213 cases, and  Veneto, where there 189, will be closed for another week. The virus has  spread to 11 out of 20 Italian regions over the past week, wreaking  havoc on the country’s already fragile economy.The financial hub of Milan is endeavouring to return to normal,  reopening museums and its famous Duomo, but the city was dealt a further  blow after American Airlines announced it was suspending flights to  Milan following the US State Department raising it travel warning for  parts of Italy. Other airlines have also scrapped or reduced flights due  to low demand for travel to Italy.On Friday, the government announced financial relief for those living  in 11 towns still under lockdown, businesses and the tourism sector  while new measures worth €3.6bn to help the economy withstand the worst  outbreak of coronavirus in Europe, and the third worst in the world,  will be introduced this week, finance minister Roberto Gualtieri told La  Repubblica on Sunday.","ITALY UPDATE: New cases in several regions. 1 new dead in Liguria, Friuli planning to close schools again. 2 news cases in Milan, both are doctors.",2020-03-01 05:41:05,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbu6mc/italy_update_new_cases_in_several_regions_1_new/

The following Tuesday she was at work and complained about her stomach/belly hurting a bit. Myself plus others told her did she call doctors/111 up on her return. She told us no as she didn't have any symptoms. We told her she MUST call and get advice she got upset and said she doesn't need too. Fast forward to Friday just gone. She had her shift covered at work due to HR and area managers being told about her trip to Venice. I am concerned due to myself being mid 40s and have 2 young children and a pregnant wife. My boss told me to not interfere and it's non of my concern.. I questioned and argued with her about the fact the traveller has kids in the same school as mine and she didn't even tell them she had been to Northern italy and it was of my interest to pursue this matter.   Apparently the traveller called 111 and was given the all clear. HOWEVER, I did the online questionnaire for travellers. I answered all questions that was obvious and 99% are obvious correctly but one question was about has your chest or belly feel hot to the touch?   She did mention this on that tuesday and when i selected yes to that question it gave me the 2 week self quarantine suggestion.  This country will fall if people like her have this attitude.

It makes the people lose faith when the truth comes out, but people’s fear gets the better of them and people over react and if the government expresses openly a worry that it’s not capable of containing the virus, nobody will adhere to their attempts to do so. Nobody will listen to whatever sound advice they do give. People will crowd the emergency rooms because they’re sneezing. Everyone will demand to be tested for the virus, and the people that do have it will be sent away like everyone else and told to not to come back unless it’s really really severe. People with immediate life threatening conditions will see fatal delays in their care, the labs will be overrun with tests so that actual patients don’t get their results for weeks.

Local authorities were still trying to  ascertain whether or not the coronavirus has cropped up in the part of  the country where the tourists visited.    >  >The RIDOH  has been closely monitoring the situation and issued a press release on  the matter Saturday afternoon, Feb. 29, following a second conference  call between state and city officials. The release follows later in this  story.    >  >The family does not live in East Providence.  The man, who has some history of respiratory illness, came home from  the trip late last week feeling under the weather. A few days later with  flu-like symptoms, he was eventually taken to Mariam Hospital where he  is undergoing tests to determine if he has COVID-19. RIDOH is overseeing  the testing and the Rhode Island Department of Education, the  superintendent said, is aware of the situation.    >  >The  man’s wife, a teacher at Silver Spring Elementary School, was back to  work Monday and Tuesday, Feb. 24 and 25, as classes started after the  mid-winter break. Following her husband’s admittance to hospital  mid-week, she and their two children voluntarily quarantined themselves  under Department of Health supervision “out an abundance of caution,”  Mrs. Crowley added. So far, no one else in the family has shown any  flu-like symptoms.    >  >The superintendent as well as  Mayor Bob DaSilva initially received an update on the situation from  RIDE officials and RIDOH director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott earlier  February 28. Later that day, the superintendent informed employees and  parents throughout the district along with the five members of the  School Committee about the matter.    >  >Mrs. Crowley said  Dr. Alexander-Scott emphasized there was no reason to be alarmed at  moment, but that the district and families should take proper  precautions like making sure sanitary conditions are maintained in the  home and classroom.    >  >Superintendent Crowley said  RIDOH officials set a target date to have the man’s test results back by  Sunday, March 1. Schools are scheduled to be open on Monday, March 2.  The superintendent added any proposed closure of schools in city would  have to gain approval of RIDE and likely RIDOH.    >  >The RIDOH press release on the matter issued Saturday, Feb. 29, is as follows:    >  >The  East Providence School Department is actively working with the Rhode  Island Department of Health (RIDOH) to take all necessary steps to help  prevent illness in our community. Although there have not been any cases  of COVID-19 confirmed in Rhode Island, we want to make sure that our  community is prepared.    >  >Rhode Islanders who recently  traveled to areas affected by COVID-19 have been self-quarantined, after  consultation with RIDOH staff, and are monitoring themselves for  symptoms related to the coronavirus. It is important to note that the  symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to symptoms presented by other viruses  and just because someone is ill does not necessarily mean they have  contracted COVID-19.    >  >RIDOH is currently working with  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to test ill people  when there are cases of concern and symptoms consistent with COVID-19.  To date none of these tests have come back positive for COVID-19.    >  >Although  the level of risk for Rhode Islanders is still low and there have been  no confirmed cases in our state, everyone can contribute to our  preparedness work by taking simple, everyday steps to limit the spread  of viruses. Those steps include washing your hands regularly, covering  coughs and sneezes, and staying home when you are sick.    >  >At  this time, the CDC does not recommend use of facemasks among the  general public. The CDC’s position is that if you are not sick, you  should not wear a facemask. The masks should be reserved for those who  are sick, so they can prevent further spread of the virus.    >  >Because  human coronaviruses are most commonly spread through respiratory  droplets, RIDOH recommends the same measures that prevent the spread of  flu and other similar viruses.    >  >Wash your hands often  with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand  sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not  available.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Stay home when you are sick.  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  Explore, understand, and update policies and resources for sick-leave and telework.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (desks, tables, countertops, door handles, railings, etc.).  Clean the surface first to remove all organic matter. Thorough cleaning with soap and water will remove most microorganisms.  Use “EPA-approved” cleaners to clean high-touch surfaces and patient care areas.  We  can all work collaboratively to share accurate information and to  reject potentially harmful myths. Remember that people who returned more  than 14 days ago from areas where COVID-19 is active and do not have  symptoms of COVID-19 do not put others at risk.",First presumptive positive conoravirus case in Rhode Island,2020-03-01 06:08:47,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbuidl/first_presumptive_positive_conoravirus_case_in/

fj6it2s,-0.9714,0.0,"It's hard to copy and paste because there isn't a transcript, but here are the summary points from Koch's speech. If I misunderstood a point, let me know. My German isn't the best, and this is kind of a hard subject to understand.* Unfortunately, the situation developed very quickly.* The federal govt closed all of the events with over 1000 attendees (this doesn't include schools, public transport, or offices), also cantons (states) can make further regulations.* As of 29/2/2020 - there are 12 confirmed cases and 5 non-confirmed positives.* There are 800 Italian cases and 21 deaths (at the time of the speech), and it's assumed that there are a lot more cases that are not confirmed.* The elderly people are mostly affected by the coronavirus from what we see in other countries.* The children are essentially unaffected by this disease.* The asymptomatic will sooner or later present with symptoms.* The asymptomatic or lightly symptomatic are hard to determine the count of, and will probably drive the spread of the disease.* Many of the people we see today, have started be sick a week ago - basically theres a delay in the presentation of the disease/numbers of sick people at a given time. So, Koch anticipates that there are many more people who have either been to Italy or have been in contact with people who have been to Italy currently in Switzerland.* We need to guard/ration our resources.* So, whoever coughs a little bit, or is a little sick, don't come to the doctor to get a test/treatment.* We need to focus on the bad cases for care.* If you have a little cough, runny nose, or a fever, have a little discipline and don't go into the public, and especially not around old people.* It's especially important this weekend if you have light symptoms, to not overwhelm the weekend hospital staff with your sickness.* The lab capacity for the corona virus test is lower over the weekend, so this is another reason to stay away from the hospital this weekend if you have low symptoms, but if you're elderly, preexisting conditions or severe symptoms, call the ER.* Right now, we have enough tests, but if we use them too fast, then we won't have enough.* By next week, we will have more recommendations about what you can do.* Media, please help us keep the population quiet over the weekend.* It's apparent, sooner or later, the disease will come and infect Swiss people in the same way that Italy is infected now.* There are no other major measures planned that we will announce soon.* The measures specifically that they are not going to do (at this time, or any time soon) is: close the borders or close schools.* On closing the borders: we can't, one reason is that many people working in medicine are people who commute across the border daily.* On closing schools: kids are not harshly affected by corona virus. This is what the current data says, if it says otherwise, we will reconsider. If the kids' schools close, then who will take care of the kids? The grand parents, and this is who we are protecting from the coronavirus.That's the end of Koch's speech.&#x200B;Edits: adding the talking points as I translated them.","Swiss BAG - Schools stay open, don't come in with mild cases, hospitals will focus on the old",2020-03-01 06:21:57,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbuo84/swiss_bag_schools_stay_open_dont_come_in_with/

fj6n74g,0.8184,0.0,"Three more people in the Netherlands were diagnosed with the Covid-19 strain of coronavirus on Sunday, the health agency RIVM announced at a press conference. The statement was made amid reports that the Beatrixziekenhuis, a hospital in Gorinchem, was closed to new patients on Friday, and those people who were already inside the facility were ordered to stay inside.""Of these three patients, it is not yet known how they became infected,"" the RIVM said in a statement it issued to the public.""On the basis of this information, we will also adjust the public advisory. If there are minor airway complaints, we advise people to stay at home, to determine if the symptoms become more serious and to contact the general physician if necessary,"" said Healthcare Minister Bruno Bruins. The advise is mainly for people who have either traveled to an area where coronavirus is more common, or those who have been in contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus.It brings the total number of known cases in the Netherlands to 10. The patients revealed to the public at the Sunday press event concerns a woman from Gorinchem, Zuid-Holland, a man from Coevorden, Drenthe and a woman from Tilburg, Noord-Brabant.The patient at the Gorinchem hospital had been in intensive care there from February 21 through Friday. The patient was taken to the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam on Saturday, where they were tested for coronavirus, a test which came back positive.All patients at the hospital will remain in the hospital under a temporary quarantine. The Beatrixziekenhuis is not accepting new patients or visitors. Staff members are allowed to leave the hospitals at the end of their shifts and return home, confirmed the RIVM.""There is also a new patient in Tilburg, a woman who has been admitted to the hospital in Tilburg. This patient, too, has spent some time at Carnaval,"" said Jaap van Dissel, who is the director of the Infectious Diseases department at the RIVM. ""At hospitals around Tilburg, inquiries were made as to whether there were more cases of pneumonia in the period around and after the carnival, which is not the case.""Investigations are now underway to determine who the three new patients have encountered. A similar investigation over a patient from Delft, revealed on Saturday night, determined she had been in contact with about a dozen people whose temperatures and respiritory abilities are being monitored.Among those in the Netherlands who tested positive with the virus are a 23-year-old woman from Delft who returned from Lombardy, Italy on February 24, an Amsterdam woman and her husband who returned from Lombardy on February 23, their toddler-aged son, and a man from Loon op Zand, Noord-Brabant, who also traveled to Lombardy. He was the first person diagnosed in the Netherlands. On Saturday, his wife and their daughter also tested positive. Health officials in the northern Italian province of Lombardy said on Saturday that 888 people there were known carriers of Covid-19 coronavirus.

fj7x8ha,0.9903,-0.128,"Please allow this to be posted - Prepping:Info  from James Robb, MD FCAP, a renowned pathologist:    Dear Family and Friends, as some of you may recall, when I was a  professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was  one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on  coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of  genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the  coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human  population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.The  current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due  to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be  widespread by mid to late March and April.Here is what I have  done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same  precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the  mask and gloves.:1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc. 2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons,  etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable  glove.3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp  the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the  door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts. 5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater  than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY  activity that involves locations where other people have been.6)  Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances.  AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated  objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.7) If  possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your  elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain  infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US: 1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going  shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when  you come in contact with contaminated areas.Note: This  virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means  that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these  droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything  that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and  potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be  infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed  upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects  your lungs). The only way for the virus to infect you is through your  nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into  your nose or mouth.2) Stock up now with disposable surgical  masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth  (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only  way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not  prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or  mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth. 3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the  appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be  alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.4)  Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be  effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from  multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several  times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms  beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the  back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand  available, but there are other brands available.I, as many  others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I  personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this  snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it.  Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular  and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge  about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already  been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this  year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic  support is available.I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. Good luck to all of us,James Robb, MD FCAP","Daily Discussion Post - 2020-03-01 | Questions, images, videos, comments, unconfirmed reports, theories, suggestions (Weibo / social media/ unverified YouTube videos)",2020-03-01 06:43:20,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbuxyx/daily_discussion_post_20200301_questions_images/

Posting because I am seeing a lot of incomplete information in regards to what individuals are doing to protect themselves and their families. Much of the advice given acts as a panacea to assuage concerns, but in reality will do little to protect people in the long-term.&#x200B;Not going to make a blog post here, so will start small.&#x200B;Sanitation......hand sanitizers are a poor substitute for actual washing of hands. Also, beware of drying out your hands. Use a moisturizer after washing or desanitizing. Cracks in fingers and hands can allow viruses and bacteria to accumulate faster and live longer on the skin. They can also open the skin up to bacterial infections (Staph, MRSA). You do not want to protect yourself from a respiratory virus only to end up with a bacterial infection when hospitals are overcrowded and antibiotics may be in short supply.Hand sanitizers are one of the first items seeing shortages as well. This is, IMHO, a ""good thing"" for those in the know, as people have not yet made a run on rubbing alchohol and bleach. You can use rubbing alcohol as a more effective hand sanitizer, ensure you moisturize after doing so. Also, if worse comes to worse, you can use a 1/8 bleach/water solution to clean hands. Leave in place for 30 seconds after rubbing hands, then rinse/moisturize. Also use a 1/8 bleach/water solution on door knobs, faucets, or anywhere else where there is high human contact.

So my current opinion is, that it is very likely that the Coronavirus will not be contained.","Daily Discussion Post - 2020-03-01 | Questions, images, videos, comments, unconfirmed reports, theories, suggestions (Weibo / social media/ unverified YouTube videos)",2020-03-01 06:43:20,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbuxyx/daily_discussion_post_20200301_questions_images/

Masks were already out of stock, but people were coming out loaded up with all sorts of other stuff.I went to a market later in the day and people had carts loaded up with 45 kilo bags of rice, large bags of lentils, and tons of other stuff. Anything remotely related to the illness like alcohol or sanitizer was already gone.It's going to hit this area hard. The highlands are cool and rainy, the health care system can't deal with an outbreak, and the supply chains will get stressed in a hurry.

fj6lc6q,-0.9934,-0.4939,"Open letter to the Minister of Public Health: ""Coronavirus, listen to the fear.""Dear Madam Minister, You assure the country that we are prepared to deal with the new coronavirus, yet some key frontline players, nurses and doctors, are not reassured, and neither am I.I'm a PhD in science and I led a group of researchers in the United States studying human coronaviruses in general, and the one responsible for the SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV, in particular. I have done this work at two institutions, as a faculty member at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and as an investigator at the only institute in the world devoted exclusively to respiratory disease research, in Albuquerque, where I had the opportunity to study all aspects of aerosol production and aerosol transmission. At both institutions, I was one of the officers responsible for ensuring that all experiments involving infectious or recombinant agents followed all the rules and did not pose a danger to the general public.I have already sent you a file via the SPF Santé website on 12 February which indicates that if the proportion of symptomatic cases due to the new coronavirus reaches 1% of the population, we would be at the threshold of a hospital crisis due to a lack of beds (your reference: CCAL0331485). It has not been followed up and that is why I am writing to you directly.Your public statements suggest that you do not fully grasp the nature of the danger facing Belgium and the rest of the world. I would like to draw your attention to two key points about the new coronavirus that seem not to have been sufficiently considered.In an interview published on Wednesday the 26th, you answer the question ""But exactly how many beds do we have?"" : ""You know that in Belgium we have more than enough beds and sufficient treatment capacity. That is an advantage. When you compare this with a winter flu and the number of elderly patients who are usually hospitalised, the situation is the same"".In my file, I quoted the WHO which, on 10 February, estimated that ~16% of symptomatic patients were in a sufficiently serious condition to require hospitalisation. Influenza? ~0.2% of cases! What's the ratio between the two? A factor of 80, so it is not an identical situation, which is the first essential point that is neglected.The WHO fact-finding mission to China delivered its report yesterday, it is worth consulting. We now have more precise figures for symptomatic patients: 80% mild cases (can stay at home), 13% severe cases (hospitalization), 6% critical cases (intensive care).Would you be so kind, Madam Minister, you who have access to all the information on the Belgian hospital network, to calculate for all of us: from how many symptomatic cases would the Belgian hospital system run out of hospital beds for severe cases and critical cases?There is a cacophony of incorrect information circulating not only in the written and audiovisual press about the new coronavirus, but also on the FPS Santé and Sciensano websites. The official position seems to be that COVID-19 is a SARS-2.0 and therefore the measures that would be appropriate for SARS-1.0 will be appropriate for COVID-19.This is unfortunately a false equivalence and there is an urgent need to understand the essential difference between the spread of the virus responsible for SARS-1.0 and that of the new coronavirus. SARS-CoV was transmitted mainly by surface contamination and by sputum, which does not travel much more than a metre, but rarely by aerosolization. All indications are that a significant proportion of transmission of the new coronavirus is by aerosol, which completely changes the picture for isolation measurements.The first cases of SARS in November 2002 were detected in the city of Shenzhen, which had a population of 7 million at the time, and ultimately infected 5327 citizens in China. The first cases of COVID-19 were detected in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, population 11 million, and have infected 78,497 individuals in China to date (according to the Chinese government; nearly one million according to some epidemiologists), the first indication of the difference between the two viruses.The basic reproductive number of the new coronavirus is between 4.7 and 7 according to the calculations of different epidemiologists, which is different from the actual reproductive number calculated by WHO (2.5), the difference being that the basic number corresponds to the situation without isolation measures, and the actual number changes according to the implementation of different isolation measures.Let us take the situation of Italy as an example. The first two cases were confirmed in Milan on 31 January and 28 days later we have 655 cases. Epidemiology tells us to take the logarithm to base 2 of 655 cases divided by the two initial cases, i.e. about 8.3, so the number of cases has doubled every 3.3 days, almost doubling every 2.4 days in the absence of isolation, and while isolation measures have been in place for the past few days. These figures are consistent with a high number of duplicates.So we have an epidemic at least 10 times greater than SARS-1.0 at the same time in China, a new coronavirus with high intrinsic contagiousness, epidemiologists who calculate that every second infection could be caused by a person who is still asymptomatic, and we also have multiple episodes of supercontagion. What can we conclude? You won't find many transmission experts who will tell you anything other than that this new virus can be transmitted by aerosolization, a second key point that has been neglected so far.You acknowledge that the virus is more contagious, but what is the implication? If the flu virus infects 2 to 8% of the population, year in and year out, and this virus is more contagious than the flu, what will prevent it from spreading at least like the flu in an immunologically naïve population?With the current lack of an effective vaccine or treatment against this new coronavirus, the question of availability of hospital beds takes on all its significance and urgency, given the much higher rate of complications with this coronavirus.There is no need for a debate among experts, although in a crisis situation it is always good to confront the divergent views of experts, because the Public Health function is asking it to prepare for the worst scenario, not the rosiest. Experts and officials in other Western countries also recognize the seriousness of the risk we all face.You have told us that the objective is to ""keep the virus out of the country as long as possible through adequate surveillance of the territory"", but we learn from a courageous nurse who has just returned from Veneto, a region of Italy with a few cases of COVID-19, that not only is she not being asked to isolate herself, and is asked to return to work immediately, but she is also being refused testing!Not only is she not tested, but she also tells us that there is in fact an omerta against testing for the new coronavirus for cases of flu symptoms not related to a Chinese connection. Explain to us, Minister, exactly how you adequately monitor the territory when the most basic screening is not done?We also wonder about the lack of recommendation, screening, quarantine and supervision for people returning to Belgium from a contaminated area, also knowing that the incubation period can exceed two weeks and that there are cured patients who have been re-infected.","Open letter to the Minister of Public Health: ""Coronavirus, listen to the fear.""",2020-03-01 06:54:37,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbv2kc/open_letter_to_the_minister_of_public_health/

fj6lhjy,-0.9127,-0.4939,"General practitioners are concerned about the lack of serious communication from the Ministry of Health, an e-mail is not enough in this situation. They contrast the current response to the one during the H1N1 epidemic in 2009 when they were given clear information and masks. Nor should we ignore their request to have a system in place to support individuals who should remain isolated.Why wait to protect medical staff when the Chinese government admits that more than 3,000 medical staff have been infected in Wuhan? Would we be so short of the necessary equipment? What is the situation from a logistical point of view? You say we are ready, but we wouldn't even have masks for the general practitioners?What should we say to the families of infected or even deceased medical staff if we were to mourn victims whose infection could have been prevented by the earlier implementation of personal protective measures?Zhong Nanshan, who heads the COVID-19 expert team at the Chinese Ministry of Health, said the epidemic had been ""a hard lesson"" for the country: ""If we had taken strict prevention measures in early December or even early January, we would have greatly reduced the number of patients,"" he said at a press conference.The Chinese authorities made the same initial mistake with SARS and with COVID-19, but they have since mobilized to fight the virus with the extremely strict measures that are necessary when a virus is transmitted by aerosol and asymptomatically. We are making the same initial mistake as the Chinese!And we must now learn the lessons of the first phase of this epidemic, how the Chinese have moved from a very broad quarantine model, 400 million inhabitants, to a flexible and targeted approach. It remains to be seen how many cases will emerge as the population returns to its normal activities, but the very advanced surveillance system suggests that they will be able to contain these new cases.Shouldn't we follow the lessons of China, and also follow the adage that prevention is better than cure? Today, in the face of this coronavirus, we have no vaccine or treatment available, which should logically lead us to implement a whole series of preventive actions given this lack of cures. It is imperative to mobilise the population and all health care personnel to enable prevention to play its role through an information campaign on the scale of the challenge facing Belgium.Fear can be rational, just as fear can be irrational. Fear is an emotion essential to our survival, and we must be able to listen to it. I am willing to cross my fingers with you that Belgium will be spared and that the spread of the virus will slow down with the end of the winter, but I believe that the government, whose fundamental function is to protect the public, could do more in this situation, and I remain at your disposal if my expertise can be useful.","Open letter to the Minister of Public Health: ""Coronavirus, listen to the fear.""",2020-03-01 06:54:37,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbv2kc/open_letter_to_the_minister_of_public_health/

fj6rz6p,0.8138,0.3346,"Full Thread ( [Link](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1233970271318503426?s=21) ): The team at the Seattle Flu Study have sequenced the genome the COVID19 community case reported yesterday from Snohomish County, WA, and have posted the sequence publicly to gisaid.org. There are some enormous implications here.This case, WA2, is on a branch in the evolutionary tree that descends directly from WA1, the first reported case in the USA sampled Jan 19, also from Snohomish County, viewable [here](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?f_division=Washington)This strongly suggests that there has been cryptic transmission in Washington State for the past 6 weeks.It's possible that this genetic similarity is a coincidence and these are separate introductions. However, I believe this is highly unlikely. The WA1 case had a variant at site 18060. This variant is only present in 2/59 viruses from China.I'd assess the p-value for this coincidence at 2/59=0.03 and so is statistically significant. Additionally, these two cases are geographically proximal, both residing in Snohomish County. I believe we're facing an already substantial outbreak in Washington State that was not detected until now due to narrow case definition requiring direct travel to China.We will be working closely with @KCPubHealth and @WADeptHealth to investigate the full extent of the outbreak.We're hoping to update soon with better estimates of the number of infections in Washington State using available data. Thank you to the @seattleflustudy team, and particularly to @lea_starita, for exceptionally fast turnaround from diagnostic assay at @WADeptHealth to sequenced genome.","The community case reported yesterday in Washington state, WA2, is on a branch in the evolutionary tree that descends directly from WA1, the first reported case in the USA sampled Jan 19.

fj6tbs0,-0.3008,0.0,"I can:""A team from the University of Rochester Medical Center gathered in late February for a drill: What would the hospital do if someone showed up presenting with symptoms of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus?The group went through the steps: Masks on. Get the patient into an isolation room. Rule out other possible causes. Notify county and state health officials.Now, the student health center is setting up a similar planning session.There have been no suspected cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, at the University of Rochester. But the school, with more than 12,000 students in western New York state, knows it might not stay that way.“We need to really get on top of things early,” said Dr. Ralph Manchester, vice provost and director of University Health Service, the student health center.Colleges and universities across the U.S. are updating pandemic protocols in anticipation of potential widespread outbreaks of the fast-moving virus. They have a unique challenge that can’t be addressed by setting work-from-home policies, the way companies can. On campuses, thousands of students live in close quarters, with communal bathrooms and dining facilities.Schools look far different than they did during the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. The college student population has grown more diverse and mobile in the past decade, and faculty have more research relationships with counterparts in far-flung regions. That means plenty of people with recent travel to, or other connections with, China, South Korea, Europe and elsewhere.Colleges say they are following guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including recommending 14-day self-isolation for individuals who may have been exposed.On Thursday, the University of California, Davis said three students were being isolated as one awaits results of a test for the virus; four other students at three schools in the Los Rios Community College District around Sacramento also are in isolation, after being exposed to an individual who tested positive in northern California.The American College Health Association, an organization of campus health programs at more than 1,100 institutions, created a task force on the virus 10 days ago. “And it is as if we have been shot out of a cannon since then,” said Dr. Jean Chin, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of Georgia who is chairing the new group.The team is reviewing guidelines from the CDC, World Health Organization, the U.S. State Department and other authorities, distilling medical literature into digestible advisories for campus communities and establishing guidelines to help members prepare for the disease.The University of Rochester established a Coronavirus University Response Team in February, looking at everything from emergency response and public health to addressing possible xenophobia, monitoring international travel and planning for the potential impact on applications and enrollment.The University of Colorado Boulder created a pandemic section for its emergency operations plan in 2015, and one for infectious disease a year later. The guidelines lay out things like how to coordinate with local health officials and various containment measures once a threat has been identified. The campus has roughly 35,500 students.Decisions such as halting campus operations would depend on how many cases were confirmed and where the affected people live, said Dan Jones, Boulder’s associate vice chancellor for integrity, safety and compliance.Some schools don’t have to dust off their doomsday guides because they have recently battled contagious diseases. Syracuse University had dozens of confirmed cases of mumps in late 2017 and had to coordinate closely with the CDC and county and state health departments.A few years ago, Rochester had roughly 200 reported cases of norovirus, whose symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Dr. Manchester said there were likely closer to 1,000 people affected.The last six weeks of spring semester that year, the university was in “all-out ‘control-this-outbreak’ mode,” Dr. Manchester said. The school stepped up regular cleaning services, switched to packaged-food distribution rather than open buffets like salad bars, and even swapped out buckets of coffee stirrers for individually wrapped ones.Schools see coronavirus preparation as a good opportunity to remind students and others to maintain proper hygiene, including covering coughs with arms and not hands, staying home when sick and washing hands regularly. To get the message out, they are sending emails, issuing flashing alerts on central websites and posting signs around campus.""",US Colleges Prepare - can anyone in here get past this paywall???,2020-03-01 08:20:03,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbw9zq/us_colleges_prepare_can_anyone_in_here_get_past/

Here (US), we take whatever we can for the symptoms to subside/be not an issue, and go to work.We can't afford not to.  And by ""we"" I mean the millions of blue collar workers, who are the backbone of the working force. Those are your services, your nurses, your lab techs, the cashier's,  your pharmacist, your teachers, etc. So yeah, we go to work when sick and contagious. With kids, it's a little different, since the common perception in schools and daycares is "" eh, little kids are always snotty. "" Basically a child has to run a fever or appear significantly and visibly I'll, in order for a) parent being willing/able to keep them home, and b) for them to be sent home from school. I am curious to see if CoVID will change cultural/social norms of how we view communicable diseases. Bottom line is, majority of workplaces in US have little to no labor laws or contingency plans for the employees to be able to stay home with a sick child. If a family is able to get by on a single salary, then they are fortunate in a way. There's a parent that's able to stay home with a sick kid. But since more and more households depend on both parents working, as we can guess, there'll be more instances of snotty kid being sent to school. As for adults, to give an example, I have no paid time off that would cover even a shortest quarantine. Hell, even with the regular flu illness, I'd be SOL. I have health insurance, but at no point will I be able to afford to stay in the hospital for an  illness. Funniest part? I work for the very hospital that I cannot afford to get treated at, or even stay home if I'm sick. Welcome to the Land of the Plenty. And that's how the  majority of people I know feel.

fj6yxgu,-0.9955,-0.7506,"""ANNISTON, Ala. — Not long before local leaders decided, in the words of one of them, that federal health officials “didn’t know what they were doing"" with their plan to quarantine novel coronavirus patients in town, a doctor here set out in a biohazard suit to stage a one-man protest along the highway with a sign. “The virus has arrived. Are you ready?” it asked.The town didn’t think it was. Residents already were unnerved by strange stories posted on Facebook and shared via text messages about helicopters secretly flying in sick patients, that the virus was grown in a Chinese lab, that someone — either the media or the government — was lying to them about what was really going on.The quarantine plan hastily hatched by the federal Department of Health and Human Services was soon scrapped by President Trump, who faced intense pushback from Alabama’s congressional delegation, led by Republican Rep. Mike D. Rogers. Americans evacuated after falling ill aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan would not be coming to Anniston, a town of 22,000 people in north-central Alabama, after all. They would remain in the same Texas and California sites where they were taken after leaving the cruise ship.What happened here over the past week illustrates how poor planning by federal health officials and a rumor mill fueled by social media, polarized politics and a lack of clear communication can undermine public confidence in the response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease named covid-19. The rapidly spreading virus has rattled economies worldwide in recent weeks and caused the deaths of more than 2,900 people, mostly in China.Read the latest news about the coronavirusThe panic and problems that burned through Anniston also provided a preview of what could unfold in other communities, as the spread of the virus is considered by health experts to be inevitable.“Their little plan sketched out in D.C. was not thought out,” said Michael Barton, director of the emergency management agency in Calhoun County, where Anniston is located.As local officials learned more, Barton added, “We knew then —”“We were in trouble,” said Tim Hodges, chairman of the county commission.In Anniston, local leaders were stunned to discover serious problems with the federal government’s plan for dealing with patients infected with the virus — starting with how the patients would get to Alabama, according to interviews with county and city officials, along with business leaders who dealt with the federal response.“I was shocked,” Anniston Mayor Jack Draper said. “I was shocked by the lack of planning. I was shocked by the manner in which it was presented to us.”Two HHS officials — Darcie Johnston, director of intergovernmental affairs, and Kevin Yeskey, principal deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response — said in a Feb. 23 meeting with local officials that the patients would be flown from California to the Fort McClellan Army Airfield in Anniston, according to multiple local officials.The airfield was closed when the Army base was shuttered in 1999. Local officials said they told the HHS officials during the meeting the runway was in bad shape.“The more we talked,” Hodges said, “the more holes we found.”The HHS plan also called for housing coronavirus patients at the Center for Domestic Preparedness, a FEMA facility on the old Army base and one of several redevelopment projects at the sprawling outpost.The center has several brick dormitory buildings — behind tall black fencing — where federal officials planned for the patients to live. Federal officials even picked out the building they wanted to use for the first arrivals: Dorm No. 28, local officials said. A team of federal health workers would care for the patients and U.S. marshals would keep them from leaving the quarantine, local officials said they were told.The dorms normally house emergency responders from around the country.But the center doesn’t have any special capabilities for handling infectious diseases, local officials said. The center is used for training. It has isolation hospital rooms — located in a former Army hospital building — but they are mostly just props, with fake equipment and light switches that exist only as paint on walls.Meanwhile, federal officials never contacted the town’s hospital, Regional Medical Center, about handling covid-19 patients, said Louis Bass, the hospital’s chief executive.Yet HHS officials said in a statement released to the public Feb. 22 that patients who become seriously ill would be sent to “pre-identified hospitals for medical care.”“We were surprised,” Bass said.The hospital does have eight negative-pressure isolation rooms, but patients with serious complications would need to be sent to a larger institution, such as Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, 90 miles away, Bass said.Emory University Hospital did not respond to a question about whether it was told about the HHS plan.A federal contract for a local ambulance service was secured at the last moment, after HHS had already issued a statement about its plan for Anniston. Details on how to handle other tasks — including patients’ laundry and food — seemed unfinished.The preparations for bringing patients to Anniston were handled partly by Caliburn International, a government contractor that previously provided emergency medical services to federal agencies, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Post.Former Trump chief of staff John F. Kelly joined the firm based in Reston, Va., as a board member last year. Caliburn is the parent company of Comprehensive Health Services, which has come under scrutiny for its operation of medical services at a detention site for migrant children.John Kelly joins board of company whose subsidiary runs shelter for migrant teensA Caliburn spokeswoman referred questions about the Anniston operations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.HHS, through its Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, responded to The Post’s questions about its Anniston operations with a statement noting the office’s staff members “have a long-standing relationship” with the disaster preparedness center and were familiar with its capabilities. The statement also said the federal agency “was considering the facility as a contingency location” and decided during discussions with local officials that “the site would not actually be needed.”It was Trump who finally canceled the planned quarantine in Anniston on Feb. 23, according to tweets from Rogers and Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) that referred to their conversations with the president.I just got off the phone with the President. He told me that his administration will not be sending any victims of the Coronavirus from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to Anniston, Alabama. Thank you, @POTUS, for working with us to ensure the safety of all Alabamians.— Richard Shelby (@SenShelby) February 23, 2020The news arrived as people attended an emergency meeting of the Calhoun County Commission. Cheers broke out.“I guess in our culture today a tweet is considered official,” Barton said.Anniston has plenty of experience dealing with unwelcome threats — and learning to live with them.It was for years home to the nation’s chemical weapons stockpile, including sarin and mustard gas. Later, it was the location of a chemical weapons incinerator, where those munitions were carefully destroyed.The town also deals with the toxic legacy of a former Monsanto plant that for decades polluted the soil and water with PCBs, which were banned in the 1970s amid health concerns. The pollution resulted in a $700 million settlement for 20,000 residents in 2003.But the novel coronavirus posed a different kind of challenge.Fear that the HHS plan was flawed gave new energy to already circulating rumors and wild theories about the virus.Residents didn’t know whom to believe. Trump had said without evidence that CNN and MSNBC were exaggerating the threat. Rush Limbaugh was on the radio saying it was no worse than the regular flu. Facebook posts claimed the outbreak had been foreshadowed by a 1981 Dean Koontz book. And the idea the virus could have been created in a Chinese biochemical lab was floated widely, including by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).The whirlwind caught the attention of Michael Kline, a urologist in Anniston.“I don’t think anyone knows what’s going on,” he said.So on the weekend of Feb. 22-23, Kline dressed up in a blue biohazard suit with his “the virus has arrived” sign. He stood along the highway and waved to passing vehicles. He wanted to drum up opposition to allowing infected patients in Anniston. But even the plan was abandoned, Kline said he still wasn’t certain patients weren’t being housed at the old Army base.""",Coronavirus rumors and chaos in Alabama point to big problems as U.S. seeks to contain virus,2020-03-01 09:13:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbx2ym/coronavirus_rumors_and_chaos_in_alabama_point_to/

Decision thus far is left to the hands of individual schools.In your family case your decision tree will differ from a decision tree considering the overall public. Whether you keep kids home probably depends on age range of family members. In the long-run most will get through the outbreak by probably getting it and probably getting a mild case. But given the extreme cost of probably I would anticipate those with older family members at home or the very young would take a larger disruption to lifestyle to try and avoid it.While available data is light on the impact of children it's still early and out data isn't great. There are panic related reasons world governments might opt to avoid reporting on how children are impacted. It will take time for clarity, thus not being part of an early trail may be a worthwhile goal.Eventually public psychology should turn fatalistic about the outbreak. Not doomer, but after a few weeks bunkered down start to see getting coronavirus as inevitable. Return back to normal life routines. As time goes on that will paint a more accurate picture of just how much a risk this is and it may turn out to be just a bad flu year for most. It unlikely for people to know anyone personally that actually succumbed. Time will pass and that will help narrow in that actual threat.

fj7bwpc,0.1264,-0.1027,"# Tough interventions in neighbouring countries, the Netherlands does not find them necessary**The fear of the spread of the coronavirus means that citizens in countries around us are confronted with far-reaching measures. The Dutch Minister Bruins does not consider them necessary for the time being. ""I think everyone should just think healthy for a moment.""**For example, in neighbouring countries (England, Germany), several schools have been closed as a precaution or educational institutions refuse to admit pupils who have been in at-risk areas. The Swiss government has cancelled or postponed all events involving more than a thousand people. And oil company Chevron ordered hundreds of employees in London last week to work from home because an employee with flu symptoms was tested for the coronavirus.In any case, the British are already preparing emergency scenarios in the event of an epidemic in which one in ten citizens is expected to end up in hospital. Ordinary operations will then be scrapped and hospital admissions for other diseases reduced. There are also plans in the pipeline to keep public transport running and to keep enough teachers during a corona crisis.**No shaking hands**Furthermore, the French minister Olivier Véran (Public Health) appeared on TV with an appeal to his compatriots to stop shaking hands, kissing or giving hugs. And in Germany, the elderly and chronically ill are advised to be vaccinated against the flu. This does not help against corona, but in this way these vulnerable people burden the health system less.Minister Bruins (Medical Care) is not equally enthusiastic about all the proposals. For example, in the case of such an appeal by his French colleague from Public Health. ""I think everyone should just think healthy for a moment. I think it's fine to give people a hand or a hug, but if that's annoying you shouldn't do it. And I would say: wash your hands more often if you're worried.""**Appropriate measures**In response to the far-reaching interventions abroad, Bruins also says: ""I'm always looking for appropriate measures here. I want to base those measures solely on the advice of experts, the people who work at RIVM and GGD"". And not on fear.Marc Bonten, doctor-microbiologist at UMC Utrecht, said at WNL on Sunday that strict interventions by governments - such as sealing off entire areas in China, Italy and China - but also lighter measures do make sense.Bonten: ""Only in the beginning do you have a chance to see if you can really stop the virus."" Despite all these 'draconian' measures abroad, the risk of an epidemic is very high, according to Bonten. ""It is not excluded that this will be brought under control, but the prospects are getting worse by the day.""","Hard measures in neighboring countries, the Netherlands finds them unnecessary",2020-03-01 10:44:38,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbyhek/hard_measures_in_neighboring_countries_the/

If that number is correct, we would have roughly 35,000 beds available for the entire country (or roughly one ICU bed per 9,500 people). Given that people with serious complications need ventilation for quite some number of days, those ICU beds would get filled up quite quickly. Still it was more than I thought.

fj7ibmo,0.836,-0.7096,"article with more details : [hespress](https://m.hespress.com/sciences-nature/461489.html) translation : The National Leadership Committee, created since the announcement of severe respiratory infections caused by the emerging Corona Virus (Covid-19), announced on Sunday that it continues to track the epidemiological situation internationally and that additional measures are likely to be taken. ""While recalling that no cases of the disease have been detected in our country, the Committee confirms that it continues to follow the epidemiological situation at the international level, and that additional measures are likely to be taken,"" the committee said in a communiqué. The statement added that these measures mainly relate to ""postponing the sporting and cultural events programmed in our country, the abolition of intense gatherings, and the management of trips to and from countries known to be epidemic."" Thus, the government calls, from now on, all travelers returning from these countries to avoid frequent places of intense gatherings, monitor their temperature daily for 14 days, and take refuge in a health unit as soon as the slightest symptom of the disease appears. The source added that, in addition to the preventive measures that might be adopted, a ""strong contribution"" of female citizens and citizens is required, by respecting the general health safety standards that the Ministry of Health urges.

This is why the closure of schools in Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna has been confirmed until 8 March 2020. Friuli Venezia Giulia has also asked the Government and obtained the closure of regional schools and universities for another week. In Piedmont the schools reopen from Wednesday, after two days of ""sanitation"". Reopening also in Liguria, except in the province of Savona. The province of Pesaro Urbino is also included among the territories where ""the strongest measures of suspension of teaching and public entertainment activities"" are applied, for the Coronavirus emergency. The decree provides, in the regions most affected (but not in the ""red areas""), the reopening of museums and churches; the suspension of religious services for another week; in Lombardy, the stop to gyms.","Italy installs a red zone: nobody can enter or leave, public places closed, events forbidden",2020-03-01 11:53:42,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbzjc3/italy_installs_a_red_zone_nobody_can_enter_or/

fj82nwo,-0.9737,-0.1531,"This will perpetuate the suffering.The economy is likely producing near demand for consumer goods (groceries included). A rise in demand to this magnitude means production must ramp up to meet demand. Production is more likely to decrease as businesses are closed for fear of spread, and communities shutdown.This means a shortage of goods. A normal shortage of goods would drive up prices. Add to this shortage the hoarding that is happening, and prices rise even more.What this means? Those who can afford will buy at higher prices. Those who are already in poverty will suffer as they can not afford necessities. In poverty stricken communities/countries these effects could be more deadly than the virus itself.The problem is that the individual that can afford to ""stock up"" has every incentive to do just that.",Stocking up: People across North America are emptying the shelves at Costco.,2020-03-01 12:39:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc08yu/stocking_up_people_across_north_america_are/

fj7pqba,-0.8454,-0.296,"I’ve got a conference coming up at the end of April in Ft. Lauderdale. We have people scheduled to come in from South Korea, Japan, Italy, as well as from all over the United States. My employer is moving forward as though all is well, and I just don’t buy it. We’ve seen major corporations cancel conferences. I doubt any of these overseas folks will be able to get flights anyway. Not to mention, before all this corona mania began, 211 million gallons of sewage spilled into the streets of Ft. Lauderdale, contaminating all of the waterways and drinking water in the area. The whole conference of ours just seems like a terrible idea. I’m wondering if workers who refuse to attend conferences like these might be protected under OSHA guidelines. OSHA says:“Your right to refuse to do a task is protected if all of the following conditions are met:Where possible, you have asked the employer to eliminate the danger, and the employer failed to do so; andYou refused to work in ""good faith."" This means that you must genuinely believe that an imminent danger exists; andA reasonable person would agree that there is a real danger of death or serious injury; andThere isn't enough time, due to the urgency of the hazard, to get it corrected through regular enforcement channels, such as requesting an OSHA inspection.You should take the following steps:Ask your employer to correct the hazard, or to assign other work;Tell your employer that you won't perform the work unless and until the hazard is corrected; and Remain at the worksite until ordered to leave by your employer.”Seems like I’d be well within my rights to refuse to attend this conference, based on OSHA guidelines. The problem is, I’m the guy who makes the entire thing happen... audio/video etc. They’ll crucify me if I say I won’t go. But they should cancel it in their own!Any thoughts about how folks might be able to invoke OSHAs right to refuse work in light of the Coronavirus outbreaks going on?",OSHA Right To Refuse Work,2020-03-01 12:46:03,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc0cfu/osha_right_to_refuse_work/

Given a chunk of the population works in the utilities, it is not unreasonable to consider that workforce could be reduced, thus taking longer repair times when outages do occur.If people start stocking up on the non-perishables a little more each time they go to the store, then it’s pretty easy to have a good cache of supplies in the event of a lockdown.If a widespread panic hits, then the secondary fatalities are going to make the virus look like a minor player.

fj92a6g,0.8931,0.8854,"Thank you for the write-up. I'm Korean and it worries me how countries like the US will handle the inevitable spread of CORVID19. I have heard the argument that the reason Korea has such high number of confirmed cases is because of the strong actions by the government to test almost all suspected patients (tens of thousands). If this is true, it leads to me assume it already has infected a whole lot of people in other countries and we just don't know how many because we didn't test them. Would this be a correct assumption?      Also, we saw news yesterday for a confirmed case of a 45-day-old infant (his/her parent was a confirmed case). As it stands now, would you say the baby has a high chance of probably (hopefully) passing this off like an influenza and not become fatal?","Some lovely person pointed me to a way to upload this summary as a PDF!

fj8tzcs,0.3,0.8854,"Hmm that’s a good question. What I meant by this, was that before this outbreak, there was no one who has been exposed to this virus, so there is no possibility of a break in the reproductive rate. As far as virology and understanding of immune systems go, once a person is exposed and recovered, they SHOULD now have immunity to this version of the virus (meaning unmutated). I have heard news bits saying that supposedly recovered people are testing positive, but I can’t substantiate that. Recovered cases should have immunity, until the virus mutates, similar to influenza. A vaccine should also impart immunity, once it is produced.","Some lovely person pointed me to a way to upload this summary as a PDF! (Previously posted on imgur, but now the links work!

fj9nqo3,0.9749,0.8854,"But what do you mean? If we don’t test, we have no cases, right? ( sarcasm)- ....ya I totally agree and it’s been a main complaint that Americans on the coronavirus board seem to have- that we aren’t testing, so we truly have no idea how many cases we have (same is true here in Canada). As it currently stands, there are still no known fatalities in kids under 9. So the assumption is that this is very mild in kids- it is unreasonable to think that kids just haven’t gotten the virus- and with how infective it is- if their parents have it, they have it.  So with our current knowledge, we can assume that kids are flying through this with no problems, even very young ones. This is one factor that has to be honest, reassured me. Eventually this virus will be in the main population and likely become seasonal like the flu- and as these kids grow up they will have immunity to it and partial immunity to its variants, so this is a reassuring fact for me, (having a kid of my own) :)","Some lovely person pointed me to a way to upload this summary as a PDF!

fj813qn,-0.9577,0.0,"ICU doctor hereCPAP and bipap will buy you time in many respiratory failures like asthma copd exacerbations, pulmonary edema and may spare intubationsIn a severe pneumonia you will have no way of clearing mucus or suctioning your mucus out.  When you cough the positive pressure will just push it back.  So no it's not a great option and i haven't seen many pneumonias do well if they need CPAP or bipap for more than 24 hours.  Inevitably they all get intubated. If it's a pure hypoxic issue I rather use high flow nasal cannula so you can clear your mucus.  Unfortunately for most the work of breathing is so tough that we have to move to mechanical ventilationEdit: in ARDS early intubation, careful control of lung volumes, paralysis, and proning have led to better survival!  NIV has never helped in moderate to severe ARDS.  We can get a lot of patients out of this mess if we take control of the metabolic demand and amount of iatrogenic damage to the lungs. This is why I stress that we must control the infection rate.

I said this on another sub, but I'll repeat it here: We need to know what the treatment protocol will be. The [CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html) does not specify any treatment/medication by name, unfortunately. That means that the treatments being used in China/JapanS.Korea, like antivirals/chloroquine, are to be used with the discretion of the doctor in charge, or likely not used at all.The WHO's website doesn't even include antivirals/chloroquine as potential treatment options. However, the WHO has a booklet on [Guidance on Ethical issues During Infectious Disease Outbreaks](https://www.who.int/ethics/publications/infectious-disease-outbreaks/en/) Where it states that unapproved treatments can be used if they have been ""suggested by an appropriately qualified scientific advisory committee on the basis of a favourable risk–benefit analysis.""(page 39) It also has to be approved by the country first.This is alarming because it's up to the government to decide if and when it wants to dispense treatment. I think we need to follow S.Korea's lead with making testing available to everyone and to speed up the test/diagnosis process.

The hospital was also trying through the weekend to get in touch with hundreds of patients to determine whether they’ve been infected as well. That’s raised serious questions as to how health care professionals at Norway’s largest hospital have handled the Corona risk, and whether Norway is as well-prepared for an epidemic as officials earlier had suggested.Doctor defends himselfThe eye doctor himself, who had been on skiing holiday in the Trentino region of Northern Italy, told newspaper Aftenposten that he felt fine upon return and reported for work as usual on Monday Februay 24. He began to feel ill that night, but went back to work on Tuesday. He claims he asked to be tested for the Corona virus right after the doctors’ morning meeting, but was told it wasn’t necessary since he’d been in areas of Italy outside those where Corona infection was high.He stayed home from work on Wednesday and wasn’t tested until Thursday, according the doctor himself.

I just liked the hubris of the doctors saying they were prepared when they were spreading it: Of the 19 people in Norway confirmed to have tested positive to the virus as of Sunday night, three work at Ullevål. Another five cases have emerged in Bergen. It hasn’t proved easy to be tested in Norway, with some quarantined families waiting 15 hours to be tested by local health care authorities in Oslo. In suburban Bærum, health care workers at the emergency medical clinic attached to Bærum Hospital were testing people while they sat in their cars parked outside in order to prevent any Corona carriers from infecting the clinic or the hospital.Corona costs risingPrime Minister Erna Solberg told Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) Sunday night that a Corona epidemic can make even an economically “robust” country like Norway vulnerable. She insisted that her government had room to offset potential economic costs of the Corona virus.They were steadily rising through the weekend, with newspaper Dagens Næringsliv (DN) reporting how investors had registered paper losses of more than NOK 268 billion in Norwegian stocks as of Friday evening. The newspaper calculated that three of the country’s richest men (John Fredriksen, Kjell Inge Røkke and Stein Erik Hagen) had collectively “lost” more than NOK 30 billion of their own investments as stock markets continued to dive.Both of Norway’s largest industries, oil and fish-farming, were also being battered, with the oil price falling below USD 50 and salmon exports to China falling by 90 percent this month. The euro has never been more expensive, costing NOK 10.42 heading into the weekend, while one US dollar hit NOK 9.44.Travel and conference cancellationsNorway’s largest bank, DNB, cancelled an annual international conference due to take place in Oslo this week, while organizers of the Oslo Freedom Forum in May reported they had “postponed” it because of “the public health emergency posed by COVID-19, the Wuhan Corona virus.” Organizers said it “would not be prudent to proceed with the large-scale gathering” that attracts participants from several of the places hit hardest including Italy, Iran, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.Norwegian hotels, meanwhile, are also reporting cancellations of several thousand overnight stays. “We’re afraid the hysteria will win,” Andre Schreiner of The Hub hotel in Oslo told DN. Among the cancellations in Northern Norway are tour groups from China that suddenly aren’t allowed to travel.Norwegian tour companies offering organized trips abroad are also experiencing an abrupt decline in business. “Sales have suddenly stopped the past few days,” the leader of Escape Travel, Gunnar Grosvold, told DN. “Everyone in the business is feeling this now.”",Norway: Corona chaos hits biggest hospital,2020-03-01 15:43:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc2xr4/norway_corona_chaos_hits_biggest_hospital/

fj8d0r0,-0.87,0.0,">Italy has registered during the weekend an important rebound of infections by the coronavirus, which already reaches almost 1,700, according to the latest data provided by the Italian authorities this Sunday afternoon. From Saturday to Sunday five people died who had tested positive for coronavirus, so the death toll from the disease has already reached 34.>In total, 1,694 infected have been certified in the transalpine country, of which 83 have already recovered and been discharged. 41% of those affected by the virus, 639 people, are admitted, while the rest recover from the disease in their homes under medical supervision. The map of contagion already covers 16 of the 20 regions in the country, although the most affected by the outbreak are still Lombardy and Veneto, considered the sources of transmission.>The director of the Italian Higher Institute of Health, Giovanni Rezza, explained that the marked increase in the number of cases - more than 400 in a single day - is “within the foreseeable” and noted that the infection probably circulated in the north of the country ""Since the second half of January."" Authorities have denounced 18 people for breaking quarantines in the 11 isolated municipalities.>Rome closed this Sunday, as a precaution and until further notice, the church of St. Louis of the French, at the request of the French embassy, ​​which has not specified the reasons for this decision. The order to temporarily close this popular temple that houses three Caravaggio masterpieces comes after a 43-year-old priest who lived in Italy recently tested positive for the coronavirus in Paris.>Confusion in France>In France, on the other hand, the closure of the Louvre Museum showed on Sunday the patent confusion caused by the changing national plans to contain the expansion of the coronavirus. The gallery was not - and still is not - in the plans of the French Government, which has banned events that bring together more than 5,000 people in enclosed spaces. But workers in the most visited museum in the world refused to open the doors of the center, anxious about the potential danger of receiving visitors from countries at risk.>Similar situations occurred in concert halls and shows, which did not know whether to cancel their events or not. Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in France increased to 130. Among the new affected are two children aged 1 and 5 in Alsace and three other cases registered for the first time in the overseas territories of France, in the Guadalupe archipelago.",Almost 1700 cases in 16/20 Italian regions + first cases in Overseas France (Guadeloupe),2020-03-01 16:50:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc3u56/almost_1700_cases_in_1620_italian_regions_first/

fj8dc32,0.9617,0.0,"Full text from this Axios article, which is a reputable source of journalism:>A top federal scientist sounded the alarm about what he feared was contamination in an Atlanta lab where the government made test kits for the coronavirus, according to sources familiar with the situation in Atlanta.>The Trump administration has ordered an independent investigation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab, and manufacturing of the virus test kits has been moved, the sources said.>**Why it matters**: At the time the administration is under scrutiny for its early preparations for the virus, the potential problems at the lab became a top internal priority for some officials. But the Trump administration did not talk publicly about the Food and Drug Administration’s specific concerns about the Atlanta lab.>Senior officials are still not saying exactly what the FDA regulator found at the Atlanta lab.The CDC lab in Atlanta developed the testing formula for the coronavirus test — which the government says works — and was manufacturing relatively small amounts of testing kits for laboratories around the country. This is where the lab ran into problems, per sources familiar with the situation.>FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said, in a statement to Axios, that government agencies have already worked together to resolve the problems with the coronavirus tests.“Upon learning about the test issue from CDC, FDA worked with CDC to determine that problems with certain test components were due to a manufacturing issue,” he said. “We worked hand in hand with CDC to resolve the issues with manufacturing. FDA has confidence in the design and current manufacturing of the test that already have and are continuing to be distributed. These tests have passed extensive quality control procedures and will provide the high-level of diagnostic accuracy we need during this coronavirus outbreak.”>**The big picture**: The FDA says it now has full confidence in the coronavirus diagnostic kit, but a slew of new cases announced over the weekend suggest the virus has spread throughout the country while the U.S. government tested only a narrow subset of the population for it.>The U.S. government had admitted to problems with its diagnostic tests — which have put the U.S. well behind China and South Korea in doing large-scale testing of the American public for the coronavirus.The big question: It was not immediately clear if or how possible contamination in the Atlanta lab played a role in delays or problems with testing. Nor was it clear how significant or systemic the contamination concerns may be; whether it was a one-time issue that’s easily resolved, or a broader concern involving protocols, safeguards or leadership.Behind the scenes: The FDA official who visited the Atlanta lab, Timothy Stenzel, is the director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.>About a week ago, when the Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar was under extreme pressure over the delays in getting coronavirus testing kits to market, Stenzel traveled to Atlanta to help troubleshoot whatever technical problems might have been occurring with the tests.>Stenzel was alarmed by the procedures he witnessed in the Atlanta laboratory and raised concerns with multiple CDC officials, per a source familiar with the situation in Atlanta.Stenzel is a highly-regarded scientist and diagnostics expert. He was on the ground in Atlanta to deal with technical issues and happened to stumble upon the inappropriate procedures and possible contaminants. He is not a laboratory inspector and thus was not charged with producing an inspection report on the lab conditions.>But he raised the concerns and they have been taken seriously and risen to the highest levels of the U.S. government.>On Thursday afternoon, the concerns about the Atlanta laboratory were raised in a conference call that included senior government officials from multiple agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health.>The call’s purpose was to figure out ways to mass produce the testing kits and get them to market quickly.>The Trump administration says it’s now figured out how to get over those hurdles. An HHS spokesperson promised that by the end of this week, “we will have the capacity to test up to 75,000 individuals” for the coronavirus>**What's next**: The FDA’s manufacturing concerns — which include the possible contamination of testing kits — have also resulted in the Trump administration ordering an independent investigation of the CDC’s Atlanta laboratory, according to senior officials.>“HHS has launched an investigation and is assembling a team of non-CDC scientists to better understand the nature and source of the manufacturing defect in the first batch of COVID-19 test kits that were distributed to state health departments and others,” said an HHS spokesperson.>“HHS/CDC have been transparent with the American people regarding the issue with the manufacturing of the diagnostic and will be transparent with the findings of this investigation.” (But the administration was not transparent about the senior FDA official's concerns about the conditions and procedures in the Atlanta laboratory.)>A senior administration official added that the government also moved the manufacturing of the coronavirus tests out of the Atlanta laboratory of CDC.>The official said that the CDC engaged with a third party contractor on Feb. 20 to help manufacture the testing kits. The official added that the FDA regulator, Stenzel, visited the Atlanta laboratory on Feb. 22.>**Between the lines**: Until Thursday, the CDC’s guidance was to only test Americans for the coronavirus if they’d recently traveled to China — or had close contact with someone known to have the virus — and were symptomatic.>Under this policy, the CDC initially refused to test a California patient who didn’t fit this criteria but had the coronavirus, although the CDC disputes that it denied doctors’ testing request.>As of Friday, South Korea had tested 65,000 people for the coronavirus; the U.S. had tested only 459, per Science Magazine. China can reportedly conduct up to 1.6 million tests a week.>Although the World Health Organization has sent testing kits to 57 other countries, the U.S. decided to make its own.>There have also been problems with the tests themselves. On Feb. 12, the FDA announced that health labs across the country were having problems validating the CDC's diagnostic test, Science reports in an in-depth account of what went wrong with the tests.>The FDA announced yesterday that public health labs can create their own diagnostic test. Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told Science that he expects that public health labs will be able to do 10,000 tests a day by the end of the week.","CDC lab for coronavirus test kits may have been contaminated, says whistleblower",2020-03-01 16:54:15,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc3w3i/cdc_lab_for_coronavirus_test_kits_may_have_been/

fj8mrke,-0.9933,0.5719,"Full text:>To enter the nine-story Shincheonji Church of Jesus building Feb. 16, the 61-year-old woman needed to press her finger into a digital scanner.She was nursing a sore throat and a fever, local health officials report, and any doctor would have advised her to stay home—especially as the new coronavirus lurked in South Korea. But skipping Sunday service wasn’t an option: Church leaders take attendance by checking a follower’s Shincheonji-issued photo ID, said current and former church members.>Pushing through the glass door, she would have walked by a first-floor museum dedicated to the group’s founder, Lee Man-hee, who members believe immortal. She descended into a basement worship hall with no windows or furniture. She spent roughly two hours there, health officials determined, crammed shoulder-to-shoulder sitting on her knees on the floor with about 1,000 others. Hewing to the church’s strict routine, she would have embraced others repeatedly, wailing “amen!”The spiritual moment was a perfect incubator for disease, as was the church.>On Feb. 17, health officials diagnosed the 61-year-old as South Korea’s 31st coronavirus patient, later declaring her Patient Zero for the wave of Shincheonji-linked cases. She had also attended services the Sunday before. Health officials trace about three-fifths of the country’s 3,736 cases to her as of March 1.“It was like they sprayed the virus within the church,” said a city official in Daegu, which has about 2.4 million residents.>The Shincheonji outbreak represents a worst-case combination of factors seen in other coronavirus outbreaks—large gatherings, participants fanning out into public, delays in identifying the threat, slow or hindered responses.>Days before the lockdown of Wuhan, China, where the virus spread originated, Wuhan officials held an annual residents banquet for more than 10,000 families. Passengers on a cruise ship docking in Japan mingled for days after its first confirmed case. In Singapore, it took 10 days for health authorities to realize a cluster of infections had formed at a sales conference there and spread abroad.>Religion complicated the recipe for disaster in South Korea, pitting the government against an enigmatic church that has an allergy to outsiders and teaches members they will live forever, according to former members.>The broader global crisis harks back to December, when China disclosed the outbreak after dozens fell ill in Wuhan. The virus spread in China, where 79,394 people had been sickened as of Feb. 29, according to the World Health Organization, and there have been 6,009 confirmed cases in 53 other countries, with South Korea at No. 2. The WHO says more than 2,900 people have died.>South Korea in early February had a technologically advanced, transparent, well-funded plan to confront the coronavirus. But the outbreak at the secretive church with its rituals that demand mass human contact punched a hole in the defenses.Shincheonji members, pressured to recruit followers, travel across a country the geographic size of Indiana. Most acolytes hide their Shincheonji ties from their families. The government recently called Shincheonji a “Korean cult.”>“To Shincheonji members, their priority is not the safety issue,” said Ji-il Tark, a Busan Presbyterian University theology professor who studies the group, “but rather protecting their own organization.”>The group’s opacity stymies some fundamentals of outbreak prevention. Without a coronavirus vaccine, officials must bank on healthy individuals to avoid contact with the sick. When infections occur, institutions and individuals must quickly share information to locate the virus’ source and prevent further spread.>“Failure to do so creates distrust, and distrust disrupts transparency,” said Tim Brown, an infectious-disease researcher at the East-West Center who has consulted with the WHO, “making containment even more challenging, if not impossible.”Health officials say they don’t fully know who might be covertly carrying the illness because, they contend, Shincheonji is withholding information. Daegu’s mayor said at a Friday briefing he is taking legal action against Shincheonji’s leadership for lying about the number of followers and facilities. Gyeonggi-do province, near Seoul, has twice raided its headquarters to unearth more information.>“If we can prevent contact with Shincheonji-linked patients,” Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin said Wednesday, “we will be able to prevent the virus from spreading to other regions.”Shincheonji in a Friday press conference said it is cooperating with the investigation, has shut its facilities and believes its members are the victims. It denied concealing information.Baek In-yeop, a planning-department executive at the Daegu Shincheonji church, said in an interview he and 15 other followers rushed to get the city a list of the more than 1,000 people who attended the same two Sunday services as the 61-year-old. Any discrepancies, he said, were honest mistakes or a result of not having full information on certain members.>Mr. Baek said he didn’t attend the same services but was in the building and saw followers wearing masks. Hand sanitizer had been placed around the building.“It’s a witch hunt against us,” Mr. Baek said between coughs, noting that he was tested for coronavirus and expected the results soon. “They frame us as if we are a devil organization. We are Daegu citizens before being Shincheonji members.”South Korean officials said they haven’t pinpointed how the 61-year-old, who hadn’t traveled abroad recently, contracted coronavirus.>The government has pledged to test every Shincheonji member in the country, after receiving a list of 210,000 members on Wednesday. The group later released names of roughly 100,000 others, mostly including Shincheonji “trainees” who had yet to become full members by finishing six months of education and passing a written test, health officials said.>Over the past week, more than 1.1 million citizens had signed a petition to the presidential Blue House demanding Shincheonji be dismantled. Frustrated Koreans include Jeon In-sook, 47, a Daegu nurse. A co-worker contracted the virus and landed in a hospital room with several Shincheonji members who urged her to join the church. “There’s no difference,” she said, “between Shincheonji and North Korea.”South Korean health officials have said they expect the country’s confirmed cases to keep rising. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it anticipates infections for Daegu alone to reach 10,000 and peak around March 20.>Two weeks ago, the country had diagnosed only 30 patients, just before the tally began mushrooming after the virus hit Shincheonji. Since granting itself maximum authority on Feb. 23 to block the virus’ spread, Seoul has struggled to free up hospital beds, doctors and key supplies. It has injected more than $13 billion of emergency funds into its paralyzed economy.>Uncertainty is seeding paranoia for people like Jeon So-young, 31, who lives near the Daegu Shincheonji church and believes a co-worker may have been a member after her office building closed for disinfection. “It feels like a game now,” she said, “trying to figure out if people around me are Shincheonji members.”Fears appeared validated last week when an infection-prevention manager at a Daegu health center dealing with the outbreak had to step aside, said Mayor Kwon at a briefing, because he was a Shincheonji follower. The follower has since tested positive.>The news didn’t surprise Kim Jin-sook, 49, who attended the Daegu Shincheonji church until late last year. For three years, Ms. Kim, a piano teacher, sneaked to services by telling her husband she had a Sunday tutoring session. Even when not at Shincheonji, she could open a secret phone app where she could watch the founder’s sermons, she said; “I lived a double life.”>Mr. Lee, 89, founded Shincheonji in 1984. Born near Daegu, he joined several cults before creating his own doctrine, said Shin Hyun-wook, a former senior Shincheonji official who manages a website about the church’s history and tactics.Mr. Lee is a self-proclaimed “savior,” an embodiment of Christ with exclusive scriptural knowledge who presses members to recruit new followers, said current and former members. Shincheonji says global membership stands around 245,000 and it aspires to hit a million in three years.>How should governments work with tight-knit groups, such as the Shincheonji church, as they try to stem the spread of coronavirus? Join the conversation below.The city of Seoul has sent prosecutors a legal complaint that accused Mr. Lee and other senior Shincheonji leaders of homicide, causing harm and violating the country’s infectious-disease law, Seoul’s mayor said in a Facebook post on Sunday. A formal probe could follow.continued below",Why a South Korean Church Was the Perfect Petri Dish for Coronavirus,2020-03-01 18:36:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc582x/why_a_south_korean_church_was_the_perfect_petri/

fj8ms63,-0.0644,0.5719,"Continued from above: >One concern about the spread of the virus is how well-traveled Shincheonji members must be to aid their recruitment push, targeting busy street corners and university campuses, the Daegu official said. Active members target as many as 10 people a week, the official added.One tactic is becoming a “reaper” by infiltrating another church to lure members. Reapers attract potential recruits—“fruit,” in Shincheonji parlance—by heaping them with praise and inviting them to Bible-study groups reserved for “exclusive” members, said former church members.>Shincheonji hasn’t disclosed all of the gathering places to which it invites prospects, said Lee Dong-heon, an anti-cult counselor in Daegu. Nearly all the venues have no formal association with Shincheonji, potentially keeping them off lists of areas for investigation.>He estimated there are 2,000 hidden venues and said Shincheonji has provided information on only a little over half. “Many trainees attending these places,” he said, “don’t even know they are being recruited into Shincheonji.”Some members still don’t believe the virus threatens them, judging from the account of Kim Gwi-hui of Daegu, who said her 39-year-old daughter attended the same church on Feb 16 that the 61-year-old did. Ms. Kim said her daughter joined Shincheonji to live the eternal life it promised her.>Authorities called to check on the daughter’s health. She didn’t show symptoms but complained of a stomach ache, and the clinic sent her medication. She hasn’t been tested for the virus but is under quarantine, said Ms. Kim, who is also under quarantine and calls her daughter daily to tell her of new cases and deaths.“It’s unbelievable to her,” said Ms. Kim, “that Lee Man-hee’s followers can die.”",Why a South Korean Church Was the Perfect Petri Dish for Coronavirus,2020-03-01 18:36:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc582x/why_a_south_korean_church_was_the_perfect_petri/

fj8odi9,-0.9763,-0.4767,">**Five stages of reaction to a disaster**  >  >1.**Self-Preservation:** The first reaction to a disaster is fear and initial anxiety. People are afraid. They seek information. They do what is necessary to figure out how to save themselves.  >  >2.**Group Preservation:** With the right information provided, there is a tremendous effort—usually guided by what we call pro-social behavior—to help others.  >  >3.**Blame Setting:** This involves internalizing and many psychological consequences fall in place during this stage. With disasters, we talk a lot about emotional responses, about change in normal activities. This leads into efforts to try to figure out who is to blame and to do something about it by addressing the vulnerabilities and strengths that we have that resulted in that hazard becoming a disaster.  >  >4.**Justice Seeking:** This involves externalizing. It's part of seeking redress and leads to taking action against the perceived perpetrators of the disaster.  >  >5.**Renormalizing:** Individuals and groups adapt to the threat. So, which stages are we now? Stage 3?","An excellent Harvard piece on why denial is worse than panic, and why having an early moment of panic allows for better decision making over the longterm.",2020-03-01 18:54:55,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc5glm/an_excellent_harvard_piece_on_why_denial_is_worse/

fj8rqld,-0.9337,-0.4215,"My opinion there is undetermined.I haven't found satisfactory information as to why testing is not more widespread. I know that states like California as of a few days ago only had about 200 kits thus were using them seemingly mostly for travel cases from outbreak areas.Because the US has outsource manufacturing I suspect we've been reliant on supply from outside the country and that supply line was cut by outbreak countries keeping all supply to deal with the emergency. This was the case with supply such as masks, American companies that built factories in China had all supply taken to deal with the emergency. That's a problem even the greediest of US politicians will have trouble ignoring and will probably increase the push for decoupling, to diversify manufacturing sources to protect supply when needed.Over the weekend we just had ordinance passed allowing equipped facilities around the US to make their own test kits to supply states. I'd imagine regulations of some form prevented this. That opens the door to creation of more kits.And we've got the accuracy consideration. Seems that false results are rampant everywhere test kits are used. I've not found enough detail on known accuracy and how new kit designs are helping to improve that.Then there's the big stinking question in the room at the moment. Where are he stockpiles of pandemic response goods in the US? The messaging for the public to not purchase masks is absolutely terrible for the implication that there does not exist a stockpile for emergency workers. That's unacceptable and demands for heads to roll in government bodies for not having that in place, along with investigation into where the taxpayer money went.Interesting case for the logistics analysis of it all. I'd love a much deeper dive from some media outlets getting to the bottom of the topic. There's a whole lot of critical questions seemingly not asked that would be interesting and informative.",China is struggling with coronavirus disinformation,2020-03-01 18:59:19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc5inm/china_is_struggling_with_coronavirus/

fj8s3cq,0.913,-0.3818,"Nearly all prefectures in Japan began shutting their schools Monday in a bid to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus, four days after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe surprised many with a request for a total school closure until early April.As confusion spreads among many local authorities across Japan, some schools held their final classes or left facilities open for children who cannot stay home alone while their parents are at work. Shimane in western Japan, one of the prefectures not to have any reported cases of the virus, is the only prefecture to say it will not close any of its schools.The city of Saitama, north of Tokyo, closed all its elementary schools Monday but said they would be open for children who cannot stay at home alone. In Otawara, Tochigi Prefecture, meanwhile, an elementary school is to be closed from the afternoon but held final classes in the morning.Some schools will close from Tuesday or later.Abe announced the school closure plan Thursday evening, calling for them to remain shut through the end of the spring break in early April, when the new school year starts in Japan. The education ministry subsequently issued the request to local boards of education on Friday morning.""We cannot, under any circumstances, allow group infections among children to occur in school,"" the prime minister said at a press conference on Saturday, after his request triggered confusion among teachers and parents.He said parents who need to take time off and look after their children until schools start the new academic year will receive financial support.The health ministry said Monday it plans on requesting afterschool facilities to stay open and to utilize open classrooms amid the country-wide closures, while teachers in closed schools may be able to assist in their operation.""There is a possibility that (the afterschool facilities) will become overpopulated if the number of children sent there increases,"" Health, Labor and Welfare Minister Katsunobu Kato told journalists on Sunday. ""We would like to utilize the schools and ask teachers for their cooperation.""The government is set to bear the costs associated with the additional time some children will spend in the facilities, rather than ask parents to cover the extra costs.Furthermore, the criteria for employment subsidies have been eased for those that have been affected by the pneumonia-causing virus to include nonregular employees as well.A total of 962 infections have been confirmed in Japan, with Ehime Prefecture reporting its first case Monday -- a woman in her 40s. The total includes more than 700 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship that was quarantined near Tokyo.According to the Ehime prefectural government, the woman, who works for a local bank, is not displaying symptoms such as a fever or coughing.

It is worth a watch so you can educate yourself on the correct sequence of donning and doffing PPEs. The main variants are whether you are wearing N95 masks or Positive Pressure Powered Respirators and gown or coveralls. For civilian usage, disposable gowns, masks, or coveralls will just drain away critical resources from the most critical sectors that need them. For civilian usage, I would recommend you get something more reusable, like industrial respirators with particulate filters. They are reusable, you can still find them, and HCWs are not using them (for now)Surprisingly, looking at CDC literature and hospital practices all over the world, the use of flexible half or full face respirators are not standard and untested, despite them being pretty standard in industry and civilian usage (spraying, construction, demolition, etc ...).

These had cleared up by the following evening, they hit hard and fast, but I was left with a bad cough. Bad enough to be hacking up dark green phlegm containing a little blood. The cough persisted for about 6 days, gradually getting better each day. My symptoms have disappeared, apart from needing to clear my throat a little in the morning, but I'm still off uni as a precaution. A lot of people here are coming down with similar, reasonably mild symptoms, and being told to self-quarantine without testing for the virus. Most of those people are also recovering without developing symptoms that require hospitalisation. So don't panic too much. Just take the recommended precautions and look out for family members who might be at risk. If your country appears to be testing lots of people, you could always try asking, but that doesn't seem to be the case in many places. It isn't here.

Bureaucrats overriding experts orders, mixing infected people with clean people in flights.  Now it turns out that likely resulted in infecting the entire San Fran area.6. They have only 40 million masks, for a nation of 340 million.  There is not even enough to cover health care workers.

Ro 3.0 is ten times the transmission rate of the flu ro1.3, not three times.  This thing could easily be 10 times as contagious or more.  Yet they just downplay the risk, seeming more concerned about the stock market than lives.10. Where are the volunteer organizations recruitment?

fj927a6,0.2888,-0.2732," A tripling of emergency department capacities is one of the changes coming to Queensland hospitals to allow the state to deal with any coronavirus outbreak.QUEENSLAND hospitals will triple the number of patients that can be seen by emergency departments and double capacity in intensive care in preparation for a coronavirus pandemic.It comes at the federal Attorney-General details never-before-used biosecurity laws that would be triggered in the event of an outbreak.In addition to increasing patient capacity, Queensland will also buy 110 extra ventilators, increase hospital staff, expand fever clinics and fast track $25 million spending on medicines, gloves and masks.The plans were agreed at a meeting of cabinet’s Public Health and Safety committee this afternoon.Amid warnings it was inevitable the virus would spread in Australia at some point, Queensland emergency workers will conduct a scenario exercise on Friday to test response to an influx of patients.Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the virus was already being treated like a natural disaster.“A top priority is ensuring capacity in our emergency departments and our intensive care units and our hospitals are actively stockpiling medicines and equipment,” she said.Chief Health Officer Janette Young said the most effective method of prevention was for people to wash their hands with soap and stay at least 1.5m away from anyone who was ill.“The community has a big part to play in continuing to stop the spread of coronavirus,” she said.Dr Young said it was highly likely the virus would be transmitted in the state as the global spread continues.But she urged the public to remain calm, saying it was not necessary to stockpile food at home.Meanwhile, strict biosecurity laws will be used for the first time to crack down on localised coronavirus outbreaks, including banning people gathering at shopping centres, schools and workplaces and control orders enforced on infected individuals.The human biosecurity control orders can see a person or groups of people infected by Covid-19 forced to stay at a particular location, undergo decontamination and disclose who they have been in contact with.Attorney-General Christian Porter said the public needed to be made aware that powers granted by these laws would be enacted for the first time in the event of localised outbreaks, in a bid to keep the disease contained.“There is the ability of the government to impose always based on medical advice but nevertheless impose a human biosecurity control order on a person or persons who have been exposed to the disease,” Mr Porter said.“What will mean for Australians is actually something very important.“It could require any Australian to give information about people that they have contacted or had contact with so that we can trace transmission pathways. It will also mean that Australians could be directed to remain at a particular place or indeed undergo contamination.”He said the second power which could be used for the first time was declaring a human health response zone.“That is a power that can be used for either localised diseased outbreaks in Australia or indeed could be used to restrict individuals from attending places where larger number of people may otherwise choose to gather, such as shopping centres, schools or work,” the Attorney-General said.“These are challenging times going forward and these will be some of the first times these important powers maybe used.”The laws are part of the 2015 Biosecurity Act, which replaced the 100-year-old quarantine act.They have been technically possible to enact since Covid-19 was declared a “human disease” on January 21, but this has been the most significant warning issued by the Federal Government about their use.Mr Porter flagged the laws could be updated as Australia responds to the global disease outbreak.","Shopping centres, schools will be shut in first-time quarantine laws: Australians are being warned never-before-used quarantine powers will be enforced to contain localised outbreaks of Covid-19.",2020-03-01 21:27:17,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc7anc/shopping_centres_schools_will_be_shut_in/

fj9u9i6,-0.9649,-0.2732,"Australia is know for their pandemic preparedness particularly their crisis risk communications. They follow the core principles of effective communications and this is an example of preparing your populace psychologically for what is to come so they are not surprised and react negatively. Their approach is noted in this article as an example of a superb approach. [https://www.petersandman.com/col/abbott.htm](https://www.petersandman.com/col/abbott.htm) The author Peter Sandman along with Vincent Covello were the people who helped design the CDC plan back in the med to late 2000's. I trained with him also. Singapore also does an excellent job. CDC was following it's plan until February 26th. On February 25th, Nancy Messionier with CDC had a press conference where she was consciously doing exactly what Australia is doing by letting Americans know what to expect. [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/a0225-cdc-telebriefing-covid-19.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/a0225-cdc-telebriefing-covid-19.html)Unfortunately, the President was angered by her address and said she was trying to scare Americans not understanding the scientific, psychologically based approach she was engaging in. Instead, he wanted her head and has ended up putting Vice-President Pence in charge. And so, you can expect less transparency and an ongoing violation of the core principles of crisis risk communications. The results of this are seldom favorable to those who fail to use effective communications strategies, not to mention the public at large.  Core PrinciplesDon’t over-reassure.2.Put reassuring information in subordinate clauses.3.Err on the alarming side.4.Acknowledge uncertainty.5.Share dilemmas.6.Acknowledge opinion diversity.7.Be willing to speculate.8.Don’t overdiagnose or overplan for panic.9.Don’t aim for zero fear.10.Don’t forget emotions other than fear11.Don’t ridicule the public’s emotions.12.Legitimize people’s fears.13.Tolerate early over-reactions14.Establish your own humanity.15.Tell people what to expect.16.Offer people things to do.17.Let people choose their own actions.18.Ask more of people.19.Acknowledge errors, deficiencies, and misbehaviors.20.Apologize often for errors, deficiencies, and misbehaviors.21.Be explicit about “anchoring frames.”22.Be explicit about changes in official opinion, prediction, or policy.23.Don’t lie, and don’t tell half-truths.24.Aim for total candor and transparency.25.Be careful with risk comparisons.","Shopping centres, schools will be shut in first-time quarantine laws: Australians are being warned never-before-used quarantine powers will be enforced to contain localised outbreaks of Covid-19.",2020-03-01 21:27:17,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc7anc/shopping_centres_schools_will_be_shut_in/

fj978x3,-0.6608,0.0,"Just to give an extra perspective on this. I live in Taiwan and all the public schools shit down for two months following the winter break in order to minimise the spread. What happened? All of the winter programmes in the private schools got extended by two weeks and they made bank. Shutting down schools doesn’t work unless there is an alternative option put forward. In an ideal world, the students would stay home and do their work online, avoiding large crowds but there is no one there to watch them. Just because you might be able to do your work remotely doesn’t mean that every job can be. Just because your employer might let you work remotely doesn’t mean that every employer will allow it. The government wants to minimise the economic impact of this so all the company has to do is say that the job can’t be done unless people are on site and that’s just what will happen. Culture plays a big part here too. We’re not quite as office-focused as they may be in Japan but workers’ rights are few and far between. If you take some time off to look after your child because their school is shut, you’re probably not getting paid very much to not go in and there’s no guarantee you’ll even have a job to go back to when all this blows over. If you have a problem with going into work, they’ll just get someone who doesn’t have that issue.",Japan: School shutdowns make childcare facilities busier,2020-03-01 21:34:13,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc7df0/japan_school_shutdowns_make_childcare_facilities/

It's a way of slowing  things down. In Italy and South Korea ... a travel ban was not  justified.""Australia has, however, upgraded its travel advice for Italy.Australians  intending to travel there have been told to exercise a high degree of  caution across the entire country, and to reconsider the need to travel  to 10 virus affected towns in Italy's north.The  government has also said any health and aged-care workers returning  from Italy and South Korea must not go to work for two weeks because  they could infect vulnerable populations at greatest risk of dying.Globally there have been more than 88,000 infections and almost 3000 deaths spanning 67 countries and regions.The health emergency has seen stockmarkets plunge across the world, triggering fears of a global recession.On  Monday afternoon the Australian stockmarket was down by almost one per  cent, a vast improvement on the more than three pert cent dive it took  in early trade.Mr  Hunt said Mr Kwan's death was devastating for his family but he defended  the government's decisions about what to do with the Australians who  were stuck in their cabins on the ship before they were finally flown  home and forced into quarantine.Prof  Murphy also said it was the right course of action, and means the 10  passengers who fell ill once back home weren't wandering around in their  communities infecting others.He said the death was very unfortunate, but added: ""We were always going to have a first death.""","Virus gate open in Australia, experts say.

fj942q2,0.9397,-0.5574,"From the article itself: >	Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. When sepsis happens, the cytokine surge caused by sepsis is activated, and neutrophils in the lungs accumulate in the lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent this process. In addition, vitamin C can help to eliminate alveolar fluid by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils, and reducing alveolar epithelial water channel damage. At the same time, vitamin C can prevent the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which is a biological event of vascular injury caused by neutrophil activation. Vitamins can effectively shorten the duration of the common cold. In extreme conditions (athletes, skiers, art workers, military exercises), it can effectively prevent the common cold. And whether vitamin C also has a certain protective effect on influenza patients, only few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. In a controlled but non-randomized trial, 85% of the 252 students treated experienced a reduction in symptoms in the high-dose vitamin C group (1g / h at the beginning of symptoms for 6h, followed by 3 * 1g / day). Among patients with sepsis and ARDS, patients in the high-dose vitamin group did not show a better prognosis and other clinical outcomes. There are still some confounding factors in the existing research, and the conclusions are different.Therefore, during the current epidemic of SARI, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for viral pneumonia through randomized controlled trials.Excellent explanation.",Vitamin C Infusion for the Treatment of Severe 2019-nCoV Infected Pneumonia - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov,2020-03-01 22:28:56,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fc7ydy/vitamin_c_infusion_for_the_treatment_of_severe/

Currently the factories are being careful to make sure no one is sick, otherwise it’ll get shutdown until further investigation and reapproval.  They can’t burn through labor like before. Right now labor is short, even unskilled. Everyone in Shenzhen is wearing a mask, sanitizer is being used, precautions are being taken. But traditionally, yes, they burn through em like toilet paper for fajitas night. That’s why labor is so cheap there, the huge population.The only other regions I could realistically see a rival manufacturing economy is south east Asia, India, Africa(maybe) and Latin America. It would be in the US’s best interest to set up shop in Mexico or further south. Freight would be cheaper and labor is cheap and almost as abundant. Problem is the labor pool is divided among multiple, corrupt governments and borders. Like Africa. India is probably the second best but their tech to produce Chinese quality goods at Chinese prices isn’t there. America actually ranks one of the worst in quality and price.I forget the point I was trying to make, but China’s going to be the worlds factory for a long time to come.

They probably aren't worried about their credit scores when they are too busy worrying about everything else. Instead what is worrying is unsanitary conditions. I know in Hawaii they often have limited access to toilets so not only is there potential spread through that how are they able to wash themselves? Then if they do get the illness how are they suppose to rest when you are worried about getting ur shit stolen if you fall asleep? How are they going to stay hydrated? The mortality rates among homeless people would be quite a bit larger than non-homeless population while having an increased chance to spread and that is not good.
