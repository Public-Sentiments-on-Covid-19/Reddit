An Iranian doctor helping the country’s Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened.> The poisonings come as fake remedies spread across social media in Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it downplayed the crisis for days before it overwhelmed the country.>  Standing over the still body of an intubated 5-year-old boy wearing nothing but a plastic diaper... The boy, now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it protects against the virus, is just one of hundreds of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran."

But I'm one of the lucky few who only lost my commute. It has been nice to catch up on cleaning and patching clothes though! There's lots of little bits that we all put off until we have more time, and hobbies we have supplies for but never got into. And most people still have access to the outdoors, so getting into exercise is another good use of time. Sitting still in offices is unhealthy enough, but getting absorbed into our couches is probably worse.

WAPO | People in addiction treatment are losing crucial support during coronavirus pandemic,2020-03-27 07:57:30,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fpybiq/wapo_people_in_addiction_treatment_are_losing/,flnlths,"Isolation, Randy Albright has learned after 445 days in recovery, can be a perilous thing. It’s why, until recently, he was showing up three days a week at the Recovery Centers of America in suburban Maryland, leading group support sessions before heading to his midnight shift as a project manager for Metro.“Isolation is a luxury that you have to learn to grow into,” he often told the group, former users of pain pills, heroin, alcohol and other drugs.Now, with much of the country shut down amid calls for social distancing, 56-year-old Albright and thousands of others face weeks or months without the in-person meetings and support services long considered a lifeline in drug treatment and recovery.From Seattle to New York, providers have been forced to cancel support groups or move them online. Inpatient treatment centers have limited family visits. Counselors have urged patients to check in by phone. Clinics that dispense medications to treat opioid addiction have reduced access to their waiting rooms, routing staff outside for curbside delivery.At a time when overdose deaths from opioids and other drugs are rising in many states, addiction specialists worry the changes in a newly isolated America will disrupt the fragile healing process for those who rely on a robust drug-treatment support system. Albright, whose group sessions were suspended on March 11, calls it his “sober network.”Providers say they are determined to stay open, even with more limited services.Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.“The last thing that the health-care system needs right now are thousands of people in withdrawal or filling up the emergency rooms or going back on the streets and overdosing,” said Dan Reck, who oversees MATClinics, which has four drug treatment centers in Maryland. “This is unprecedented, and it’s not always clear what we should be doing.”Though doctors at Reck’s centers prescribe opioid addiction medications, which reduce dependency and ease the symptoms of withdrawal, about 1,700 clinics nationwide are certified to dispense the medications on site. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has urged the clinics to provide uninterrupted treatment.A SAMHSA handbook on disaster planning for treatment programs notes that disruption to services can cause clients in recovery to relapse, and that those receiving medication-assisted treatment “are at risk of serious medical and psychological complications if the process is interrupted.”To limit face-to-face contact and the need for daily dosing at clinics, the federal government has relaxed rules on when and how medications can be dispensed. Previously, practitioners were required to evaluate patients in person before prescribing medication; they can now prescribe following a telemedicine appointment. Opioid treatment programs can now request a blanket exemption to provide 28 days of take-home medication to stable patients and a 14-day supply for less stable patients considered capable of safely handling the drugs.There are currently no reported shortages of opioid medications, SAMHSA has advised.Providers at opioid treatment programs say they have been working around the clock, staggering dosing appointments to reduce crowds in waiting rooms and dispensing medications outdoors to patients showing symptoms of infection from the coronavirus. Technology specialists have scrambled to help counselors and doctors move to telemedicine.But the situation is tenuous: Some patients bounce from the streets to shelters and can be difficult to reach, with limited access to a computer or phone. Others simply respond better to in-person therapy.Studies have found that people in drug and alcohol recovery are more likely to relapse following crises such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters, and the coronavirus pandemic is a similarly disruptive, frightening situation.In the state of Washington, which had the first reported case of the coronavirus in the United States, the didgwálič drug treatment center told its 320 patients two weeks ago that group counseling would be temporarily suspended. Patients were so upset that chief operating officer Dawn Lee reinstated the sessions, only to suspend them a second time.Now, staff members shuttle opioid addiction medications outside to patients with symptoms of the virus and promise that counselors are available by phone. The center is working to launch telemedicine so that patients can continue individual therapy.“Their whole entire support system is now gone,” said Lee, whose center is operated by the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and open to natives and non-natives. “We teach people to find your support, talk to them, talk about what you need. If they don’t have that, they’re just completely isolated, and that’s why a lot of people use in the first place.”In Seattle, the nonprofit Evergreen Treatment Services set up a mobile dispensary — a customized van — in the parking lot of its largest clinic to give opioid medications to symptomatic patients. Group counseling has temporarily been suspended; counselors are talking to patients by phone.“We’re doing everything we can to maintain calm, to maintain a sense of we’re all in this together,” said Steve Woolworth, Evergreen’s chief executive.In New York, with more reported cases of the coronavirus than any other state, drug treatment providers have spent weeks racing to modify programs.In south Bronx, the Montefiore Medical Center suspended group therapy and reduced individual therapy sessions to weekly phone calls for patients in the methadone program. Last week, internist and addiction specialist Chinazo Cunningham said she tried calling one patient three times. She never got through.“The patients that I’m most concerned about are the patients that maybe are the least stable, who maybe have the poorest access of all to technology,” said Cunningham, who oversees a network treating 450 people on buprenorphine for opioid addiction.The Guidance Center of Westchester, a nonprofit with a facility less than a mile from the containment zone in New Rochelle, has reduced the number of patients on site from as many as 175 a day to 50. Instead of coming in for daily dosing, patients have been given take-home medication.Chief executive Amy Gelles said she worries about social isolation, though some counseling sessions are being held through telemedicine or by phone.“The coming in . . . every day is not only good for getting medication, but patients would touch base with counselors,” she said. “They’d have peers that they connect to and get a tremendous amount of support in groups. So that’s all gone.”It’s critical for the government to continue to assess the ongoing impact of the pandemic on those in treatment and recovery, said Anthony Dekker, medical director of nine outpatient community clinics for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in northern Arizona.Telemedicine, he said, can augment but not replace face-to-face contact.“In every crisis that has occurred in this country, whether it’s earthquakes or hurricanes or floods, people have used more substances of abuse,” said Dekker, an addiction and pain management specialist who noted he was not speaking on behalf of a federal organization.“People who have alcohol use disorder may have a loss of recovery. People who have opioid use disorders cannot get to their clinics,” he said. “We should be planning ahead. . . . These things should be discussed now.”Albright, the project manager in Maryland, said he plans to keep busy at home. He collects classic cars, crochets blankets and checks in regularly with family and friends. He’s given out his phone number to members of his support groups.With more than 1,000 patients a day in residential and outpatient treatment in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland, the Recovery Centers of America is open but has suspended large gatherings, family education days and family visits. Staff members are improvising with telemedicine and using FaceTime and video apps to connect patients with their families.“One common expression you hear in [Alcoholics Anonymous] is, ‘Don’t wander into your head alone. It’s a dangerous neighborhood,’ ” said chief scientific officer Deni Carise. “What do you do when you can’t go to a meeting? How do you get support when you can’t meet with other people in recovery? I’m worried that the isolation will lead people to start questioning their recovery or put them at risk.”Albright, who used pain pills for four years before seeking treatment, said he is determined to see his recovery “continuing tomorrow.”“As long as I maintain the tomorrow element, I’m fine,” he said. “But then again, I have my plans in place should I start to feel differently or think differently. Everything is a plan. I mean, don’t we all plan for the worst?”Joel Jacobs is a graduate student in journalism at the Medill Investigative Lab at Northwestern University."

Would they test him, even though its almost impossible for symptomatic people get tested? How would they enforce a 2 week quarantine if they released her to my husband? Would they make me stay at the hospital, or make my baby stay? Not trying to be argumentative or fight the system here, I just don't understand how it would work...

I’m fond of saying RI is the Delaware of New England . It’s drive through/beach country.  The state may have started with a small cluster early, but because of its relative isolation, community spread caseloads in RI growing more slowly vs. CT or MA and the more cases that have been around for 3-5 weeks, the more deaths.Interestingly, VT has 9 deaths despite being very isolated and rural , but the population there is very old and it was ski season before-I’m guessing-resorts got shut down?Give it time, though.

This doesn't mean everything is fine in India but it does mean that all hope is not lost.Hopefully we will stay in the same path. This can't be statistical noise(no.of tested is lot and also only recently they started testing non-severe cases. So if anything this has to be upper bound).

By the time he spoke, shops had closed for the day, catching off guard people who had been repeatedly told not to panic-buy. Sorry if I'm picking out one point to argue here but I'm not Indian and have no idea how the situation on the ground in India is - I'll let more knowledgeable folks speak here.Honestly it's vague as to who to blame here (both India and around the globe) regarding lack of preparedness of the people.On one hand, governments and the public media (who are in the pocket of the authorities) have been downplaying the pandemic for literally weeks. They should have sounded the alarm back in January but a lot of them, for the sake of propping up markets and money, waited till this month. Fucking 6-10 weeks later.On the other, it goes to show how many people go about their daily lives with their brain turned off. All they care about is social media, memes, celebrities, traveling, and the associated variants of showing off + consuming brainless content. Anyone who hasn't been asleep or had their fucking common sense/critical thinking switched off in the last few months would have realized how bad it was in February at latest (After it hit Iran and Italy big time) and started preparing.At least developing countries have 'not enough money to be worrying too far into the future' or some cop out as an excuse. It's the same shit in so-called ""first world developed countries"". I had done most of my prepping by March 7, over a week after the first ""oh my it's really happening in Germany"", and everyone was still out and about, downplaying and laughing over the virus... by a week later, everyone was panicking and OMG THERE'S NO MORE RICE/PASTA/FOOD IN SUPERMARKETS!!!!"

I’m the Graphics Director at The New York Times and am one of the editors of the coronavirus data project. There are a number of great efforts to collect county-level case data. It’s been a tremendous challenge for all of us because the numbers are being reported by many different jurisdictions in many different formats. Some states are reporting county data, but in others you have to go county-to-county to get reliable data. I believe that our effort was one of the first, so our data goes back to the announcement of the first case in Snohomish, Wash., on Jan. 21. Also, we have a team of more than 30 journalists who have been working around the clock, seven days a week, gathering the data and making sure new data is consistent with what we’ve collected so far. As the case count grows rapidly, we are collecting more and more data by writing scripts to pull data from PDFs, press releases and web sites (written by another team of about 20 data journalists and developers). But there are still a considerable number of places across the country that are not reporting their data in an easily machine-readable format, so I don’t foresee that we will be able to completely automate the task."

(They stick those long af, specialized (short supply) cotton swabs up the patients nasal passage so far it scratches the back of the throat and causes all kinds of involuntary reactions like coughing.)  This is good for more than one reason: 1) It reduces the chance of workers getting the virus, 2) it reduces the use of PPE, as testers no longer have to change masks, etc, after every test when they get all up in there, and 3) it relieves the shortage of those aforementioned long af swabs used to scrap the back of the throat through the nose.  There's ample supply of cotton swabs that can reach the top of the nasal cavity for self-testing; by comparison the long af swabs are exclusively made in Germany IIRC (source Gates).So far, this data pertains to USA testing AFAIK.  I hope it or something like it can roll out more widely in the near term, assuming international tests are similar.Bill Gates Ted interview:  ([via Geekwire, (streams FB video)](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/shouldve-done-bill-gates-says-us-slow-covid-19-shutdown-now-unavoidable/) [1:07:29])"

See my other comment.A bit more on recent testing accuracy:[via Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/03/26/negative-coronavirus-test-result-doesnt-always-mean-you-arent-infected/)>“A Cleveland Clinic researcher said the test developed by his hospital system is highly sensitive and specific in the laboratory, returning no false-negative results. But he acknowledged those numbers won’t exactly represent how the test will perform in the real world. Another researcher said anecdotal reports peg the genetic coronavirus tests being used in the United States at about 85 percent sensitive. That means that for someone who has the virus, there’s a 15 percent chance they test negative. A critical-care blog, EMCrit, estimated that the genetic tests are about 75 percent sensitive and suggests that a single negative swab doesn’t rule out the disease.”"

Thankfully I am able to work from home now; my company would rather have me out in the field, though.

So local govs are left to make their own decisions regarding shutdowns, curfews, and quarantines.But you have local politicians fighting amongst eachother. From the ones who wish to do good, and the ones who wish to stay in favor of those who put fat checks in their bank accounts.For example, the Mayor of my county argued against the shutdown of non essential business, saying our Governer doesn't care about people. And how we ""have no cases"" and shouldn't act until twe did. Despite the fact we weren't testing, and the fact our city relies on tourism from around the globe.She changed her rhetoric when the county suddenly had 200+ positive cases within 2 days, all from community transmission. Meaning it got in our city, and is being passed around by locals. Then you have a Penn. police department not enforcing  mandated closures of non essetial businesses because they don't agree with shutdowns. Which is just neglect, and highly irresponsible no matter how good the intentions are.You know what they say about the road to hell. If you have local legislature/politicians making decisions based on how it will affect their wallets, and it is evident that they are willing to risk the lives of people who voted for them, risking the spread of this disease, and having them argue against making the right choices to keep people safe. Something needs to happen to force these children to play nice and play by the rules.The lack of cooperation within the local and federal governments will continue to prevent us from effectively and successfully dealing with this disease. Local governments are begining to act, better late than never. But the fed gov cannot act if they don't have the means to enforce. Which is why I think the means of intervention will be in the form of the National Guard being deployed in major cities, as well as cities which are not exercising the proper methods to reduce infection rates...As of right now, I expect they are going through some training to prepare them. Hence the delay of federal actions stateside. My buddy is in the coast guard and stationed in Alaska, they are asking him to stay away from people and remain healthy, incase of deployment. Grain of salt though."

Some people have been found in their homes, in streets just collapsed, and although everyone is different, some are passing without experiencing the more advanced stages of pneumonia that have been more the main focal points of the virus when thinking of what mainstream reporting on covid has told us. Bear in mind, all the findings/stats pasted below are pre-covid19. From Page 1: What Physicians Know Today (excerpts from published references)• Myocarditis is an underdiagnosed cause of acute heart failure, sudden death, and chronic dilated cardiomyopathy (2).• Acute myocarditis is a rare but potentially devastating condition that is most commonly caused by viruses (5).• Myocarditis is present in 10–50% of heart biopsy samples taken from patients with acute dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which is an important cause of heart failure and heart transplantation, with a prevalence of 36.5 per 100 000 in the USA (1).• The extreme diversity of clinical manifestations has made the true incidence of myocarditis difficult to determine. Recent prospective postmortem data have implicated myocarditis in sudden cardiac death of young adults at rates of 8.6% to 12% (3).• Myocarditis has been linked to sudden infant death syndrome, because inflammatory infiltrates have been found on autopsies of some victims (6).• In one study myocarditis was present in 15 of the 90 (17%) of sudden, unexpected deaths of children, suggesting that the prevalence of ""silent"" myocarditis may be higher in the pediatric population than is generally suspected and may contribute to a significant number of sudden and unexpected deaths in children (4).• There are approximately 75 deaths per year in athletes between 13-25 years. 89% occur in males, 64% occur in females. Most deaths occur during or immediately after exercise, with causes including Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: 36%, Coronary anomalies: 17%, Myocarditis: 6%, Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia: 4%, Long QT Syndrome: 4% (7).• Myocarditis is the reason for sudden cardiac death in 5-22% of athletes < 35 years of age. For prevention of myocarditis and sudden cardiac death it is recommended to stop elite sport for 4 weeks after an unspecific infection. Whether moderate sport can be started earlier is unclear. When myocarditis is verified, athletes have to withdraw from sport for at least 6 months (8).What Still Needs To Be Understood• Why do some people contract myocarditis when exposed to viruses and other stimuli, and others do not?• How can myocarditis be detected before developing life-threatening symptoms such as heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy?• Why does myocarditis exhibit dramatically different symptoms in different patients?• How can primary-care and emergency physicians distinguish myocarditis from other more benign conditions that exhibit the same symptoms?• What is the link between myocarditis and exercise that makes it a contributing factor in sudden death?"

A harsh truth is that the doctors in the U.S. stil don't have this disease in their fingers. They need to learn when to put a patient on a ventilator and when to have a bad news talk with the patient. Asking them if they really wish to go on with treatment.Only way to learn that is through experience. It is heartbreaking news for a doctor to tell a patient that he wil not going to make it. Be prepared for more then a few doctors/nurses telling you about this. It goes against all of their instincts and wil break their hearts.Take care for each other, have a bit of eye for each other."

A New York Doctor’s Warning,2020-03-27 09:06:09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fpzlfm/a_new_york_doctors_warning/,flnu12x,"^^Paywalled. ^^Article ^^minus ^^pictures ^^below:  **A New York Doctor’s Warning**  by Fred Milgrim  *Emergency-medicine resident physician in New York City*  > China warned Italy. Italy warned us. We didn’t listen. Now the onus is on the rest of America to listen to New York.  > In the emergency-department waiting room, 150 people worry about a fever. Some just want a test, others badly need medical treatment. Those not at the brink of death have to wait six, eight, 10 hours before they can see a doctor. Those admitted to the hospital might wait a full day for a bed.> I am an emergency-medicine doctor who practices in both Manhattan and Queens; at the moment, I’m in Queens. Normally, I love coming to work here. Even in the best of times, my co-residents and I take care of one of New York City’s most vulnerable, underinsured patient populations. Many have underlying illnesses and a language barrier, and lack primary care.> These are not the best of times; even for my senior attendings, it is the worst they have ever seen. Here, the curve is not flat. We are overwhelmed. There was a time for testing in New York, and we missed it. China warned Italy. Italy warned us. We didn’t listen. Now the onus is on the rest of America to listen to New York. For many people around the country, the virus is still an invisible threat. But inside New York’s ERs, it is frighteningly visible.> Every day, in our hastily assembled COVID-19 unit, I put on my gown, face shield, three sets of gloves, and N95 respirator mask, which stays on for the entirety of my 12-hour shift, save for one or two breaks for cold pizza and coffee. Before the pandemic, I would wear a new mask for every new patient. Not now. There are not enough to go around. The bridge of my nose is raw, chapped, and on the verge of bleeding. But I consider myself one of the lucky ones. My hospital still has a supply of masks—albeit a dwindling one—to protect me and my colleagues.> Many of my patients clearly haven’t received the message to stay home unless they’re in immediate need of professional medical assistance. Their fevers and coughs alone are not enough to even earn a test. I hand them discharge paperwork and a printout about how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, tell them to self-isolate, and then I move on to the next person. If they didn’t have the coronavirus before coming to our hospital, they probably do now. So much for gatherings of 10 people or fewer.> Meanwhile, my colleagues tend to patients in the critical-care bay with dipping oxygen levels, patients who can barely speak and may need breathing tubes.> Earlier in the month, we were told that positive-pressure oxygen masks, such as CPAP machines, were risky, as they would aerosolize the virus, increasing health-care workers’ risk of getting infected. But in recent days, running dangerously low on ventilators, we have attempted using CPAP machines to stave off the need for medically induced comas.> Still, the increasing frequency of intubations we need to perform is alarming. Our ventilators are almost all in use, and the ICUs are at capacity. Our hospital has already received extra vents here and there from other hospitals in the region that can spare them, but those few additions are merely a stopgap. Will we soon have patients sharing vents? We wouldn’t be the first hospital to attempt that unusual and suboptimal practice, which gained traction after the Las Vegas shooting, when scores of young trauma patients were vented in pairs. But these COVID-19 patients have delicate lungs, which makes vent-sharing far more dangerous. Nevertheless, we’ve already started studying the mechanics of how to make this happen, as a last-ditch effort.> By next week, we may simply have no choice. Those hundreds of relatively healthy patients we sent home may return to the hospital en masse in respiratory failure.> On Wednesday, I greeted a patient I had discharged only one week prior. When I saw his name pop up on the board, my heart sank. He is just shy of 50, with hardly any past medical history, and he had seemed fine. Now he was gasping for air. His chest X-ray was no relief—COVID-19 for sure. I needed to admit him to the hospital, and set him up with oxygen, heart monitoring, and a bed.> Last week, I saw an elderly woman on dialysis. She had arrived with a mild cough. But her vital signs were normal—no fever. After her chest X-ray came back clear, we decided to send her home. But before her ride came, she spiked a fever to 102. Change of plans. With her age and complex medical problems, she would need to be admitted.> The next night, I saw a rolling bed wheeling past me with a resident riding on top, performing chest compressions on the patient.> Only after we pronounced the patient dead did I learn her name. She was my patient from the night before. She went into cardiac arrest before she even got a bed in the ward. My first COVID-19–positive death. The numbers have been mounting ever since.> A few days ago, FEMA finally arrived to help with this crisis. It has brought more tests, hopefully more vents, and a morgue in the form of a truck to help with the ever-growing number of dead bodies. I wonder if this help will be enough. My colleagues and I discuss this pandemic with a sardonic sense of helplessness. Some of us are getting sick. Our reality alters by the moment. Every day, we change our triage system. Each day could be the day that the masks run out. There is much we think but are too afraid to say to one another.> **I do not want to see you in my hospital. I do not want you to go to any hospital in the United States. I do not want you to leave your home, except for essential food and supplies. I do not want you to get tested for the coronavirus, unless you need to be admitted to a hospital.**> For those of us at the forefront, knowing who has COVID-19 won’t change our ability—or inability—to treat patients. The problem is, and will be, our shortage of healthy personnel, personal protective equipment, beds, and ventilators. A nasal swab is not the answer anymore.> **If you have mild symptoms, assume that you have the coronavirus. Stay home, wash your hands, call your doctor. Don’t come to the emergency department just because of a fever or cough. Receiving a test won’t change our recommendation that you remain in self-isolation. We don’t want you to expose yourself to those who definitely do have the virus.**> Social distancing, while still crucial, came too late in New York to prevent a crisis. Maybe, just maybe, extreme measures can prevent this from happening in other cities around the country.> In spite of all this morbidity, the doctors at the hospital received one piece of good news yesterday. A coronavirus patient was successfully taken off a ventilator after two weeks, a first for our Medical ICU and a victory for the staff and, of course, the patient.  ^^^^E: ^^^^formatting ^^^^and ^^^^highlighting."

From the blog i linked above ""A cat in Belgium, owned by a person with COVID-19, has tested positive for the virus. The cat developed diarrhea, vomiting and respiratory difficulty about 1 week after the owner got sick, and SARS-CoV-2 was found in the cat’s feces. It’s not clear whether the test used was PCR (which can detected live or dead virus) or virus isolation (which only detects live virus), or if other samples were also tested. It’s also not clear whether the cat was sick because of the infection with SARS-CoV-2 or whether it had some other co-incidental problem (or whether the cat is still alive or not).  They were clear that this is another suspected case of human-to-animal transmission, and not the other way around.""Basically the cat got sick so they went looking for covid and found it. But, depending on the lab method they used to find it, we don't know whether they found live or dead virus in the cat feces. It's still a possibility that the cat had something else and the virus was merely there because it was in the house with an infected person. If they found antibodies in the cat to the virus, it would be more likely that the cat was truly infected because it mounted an immune response."

With as prevalent as this virus has become what is to stop the newborn from contracting the virus while they’re separated from the mother. We’re hearing stories everyday about people contracting COVID-19 while at the hospital for some unrelated reason.Birth separation can cause lifelong trauma to the mother. I absolutely do not believe the risk outweighs the benefit considering they can contract Coronavirus just as easily separated from the mother as they can being with the mother.

I know some Albanians who own their  own home and have a couple of kids. They live in the USA.The house has no wall-to wall carpeting. Any thing that cannot be moved to clean is not used. The wife pulls all the area rugs outside into the driveway and washes them with dish soap and a push broom. Then she rinses them (with a full force jet-streaming garden hose, and hangs them to dry. While the carpets are drying, she washes every stitch of dirty clothes, bed clothes and towels in the house.While the laundry is going, she cleans the floors, first by vacuuming and sweeping, (moving all the furniture) then by washing them until they gleam. She has to open the front door and the back door to get all of them to dry. After that's done, she scours every surface in her kitchen. Once all of this is accomplished she makes a mid-day meal for her family. Then she cleans the dishes and scours the whole kitchen again.Finally, she brings in the carpets, gives the carpets a final vacuum, and makes dinner. NOW. These are the same people who bought a half a cow. I mean it, the wife showed it to me, placed on the island in their kitchen. They had a special butcher come over to slice it up. Then they froze a lot of it, and proceeded to hang strips of meat outside in the sun to dry it. No salt, no pepper, no nothing. The wife takes time in summer to pickle peppers ( hand core and then pack with a mixture of salt and other chopped vegetables. Toss in a huge plastic drum and cover with vinegar. Let sit on your porch, covered, until you need them. Seriously, these people will not wear shoes in the house, keep clean, and shower 2x a day. But some still have not learned tooth brushing or underarm deodorant, but they are fast converting. I can see the wife now, washing the roof, the outside of the house, the driveway, and the sidewalks...because the virus is aerosolized, and therefore could be in the air. I bet she does it three times a week and has stepped up her house cleaning routine to 3x per week as well."

By that, I mean I think that this virus can spread to virtually anyone at any age, but we see a lot more cases at ages 60+ then we do for the younger ages.  But this is probably only due to the fact that older people are more at risk for developing serious complications and younger ages will have more mild symptoms.  Since testing is most likely only done on those with more serious symptoms, it makes sense we see much higher numbers of cases for older people. Assuming every age bracket has an equal chance of being infected, I wonder if we can extrapolate the data and determine a better estimate to the total ""younger"" age groups infected. For instance if the age group 70-79 has 15k cases and there are 1 million people in the country that fall into that bracket, then we can imply that the age group 0-19(with a population of 2 million) would theoretically have 30k cases, even though they are listed at x number, etc."

At the scene, a citizen of Huangmei County jumped on the roof of a police car in Jiujiang City, and overturned the police car to four rounds and chased police officers. The scene was very chaotic. Huangmei County magistrate once appeared to calm the incident, but the riots did not stop. The people even went to the gate of Jiujiang Public Security Bureau and asked the other party to apologize. The incident was disturbed until the afternoon.Witnesses said that the fuse of the conflict was that the Jiujiang police moved the roadblock to the traffic police area of ​​Xiaochi Town, Huangmei County, and refused to let vehicles from Hubei pass. Subsequently, 10 special police from Jiujiang City entered the boundary of Huangmei County at 10 am and beat the traffic police. . It has been alleged that the Jiangxi police only allowed some Hubei people working outside to enter and charge them fees, causing dissatisfaction between the Hubei police and the public. At least five Jiangxi police officers and auxiliary police were injured during the conflict, and walkie-talkies and camcorders were snatched. Police cars were also damaged, while Hubei has not released specific figures.Police officers from the Jiujiang Traffic Police Detachment pointed out that the Yangtze River First Bridge is a transportation hub connecting Huangmei County and Jiujiang City.

Can be released after checking.Jiujiang City Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters stated that residents of Huangmei County need to present train tickets, green health codes, and destination receipt certificates when transferring to other places via Jiujiang, and then they will be transported by Jiujiang Municipal Government to the city's railway station. If you only enter Jiujiang, you only need to show your green health code and proof of destination receipt. The headquarters emphasized that the formalities can be passed without release. The Jiujiang Municipal Party Committee denied that law enforcement officials had beaten Huangmei County police officers.As for the Huangmei police, they found that Jiujiang police officers were on duty to cross the border without authorization. When Huangmei police stepped forward to ask questions, the two sides pulled and the conflict escalated. By 5 pm on the same day, the order of the bridge had been gradually restored.\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I posted an article from a HK media because they tend to break news like these earlier than the West does, and do not get deleted - unlike *The Beijing News* (the source of this Sina article below).So here's for those who refuses to read any news from HK (even from the [pro-PRC *Oriental Daily*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fpzs3h/covid19_online_footages_show_jiujiang_city_police/flocrbj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)):[**湖北黄梅江西九江相关人员省界起冲突，两地官方介入调查**](http://archive.is/tFmdB)**2020年03月27日 18:06 新京报** (archived by someone else after *The Beijing News* source article is deleted)原标题：湖北黄梅江西九江相关人员省界起冲突，两地官方介入调查　　新京报讯（记者 王瑞文 实习生 郭懿萌）今日（3月27日）有多段视频显示，江西九江市长江一桥处，湖北黄梅县与江西九江两地警务人员发生争执，有一方人员被推搡至地上。新京报记者从黄梅县公安局与九江市委宣传部新闻科均证实，对于两地警务人员发生“冲突”一事，有关部门已经介入，详细情况正在了解中，将发布通告。　　两地执法人员发生冲突　　今日（3月27日）有多段网传视频显示，江西九江市长江一桥处，湖北黄梅县交警与江西九江警察发生争执，且有一方警务人员被推搡至地上。视频拍摄者称，事发原因是九江交警不让湖北车辆人员通行。　　黄梅县小池镇一家店铺的店员告诉新京报记者，由于黄梅县没有火车站，当地人想要复工必须从九江市坐火车，但被拦在了这里。今日上午有10名以上身着特警制服的人从九江市通过长江一桥来到黄梅县，店员微信朋友圈内发布的视频显示，小池镇交警被对方殴打。　　有目击者录制视频称，冲突的导火索系今日早上九江市将卡口前移，设置到了黄梅县小池镇的卡口处。　　两地调查执法人员冲突事件九江市交警支队工作人员李刚（化名）介绍，九江市长江一桥是连接湖北黄梅县与江西九江市的纽带，“两地相隔很近，来往也多。”近日湖北解封后，许多黄梅县人需要返工，会经过长江一桥前往九江火车站乘车出行，“一般是相关部门协调好车辆到大桥那里，出示手续检查无误后，可以进入九江。”　　九江市疫情防控指挥部多名工作人员告诉新京报记者，目前，黄梅县居民要想进入九江市去往外地需要符合三个条件：出行火车票、绿码及目的地接收证明。“九江市政府这边会安排车辆，将人员接送到九江市火车站。”　　九江市疫情防控指挥部方面介绍，如果只是进入九江市，出示绿码和目的地接收证明即可。　　对于两地执法人员出现冲突一事，一名工作人员称，“手续齐全就可以通过，不可能出现不放行的情况。”随后其挂断电话。　　今日（3月27日）下午，新京报记者从黄梅县公安局与九江市委宣传部新闻科处证实，有关部门已经介入两地警务人员发生“冲突”一事，详细情况正在了解中，将发布通告。　　对于九江市执法人员是否殴打黄梅县执法人员，九江市委宣传部新闻科工作人员称，真实情况与网传情况有所出入，过程细节仍在了解中。责任编辑：张迪"

Mary Namorato, who said she joined the club in January 2019 for $69.99 a month, called these practices “the height of corporate greed” at a time when other gym chains have taken it upon themselves to suspend membership charges.**New York Sports Clubs began operations as a cluster of squash clubs in the 1970s before introducing exercise classes and expanding up and down the U.S. east coast. Town Sports operates almost 100 New York Sports Clubs gyms in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, according to its website. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.**“People around the country are feeling enormous financial strain due to ‘shelter-in-place’ regulations, business closures, abrupt mass layoffs and the recent market collapse,” according to the complaint. “As a result, numerous gyms chains have on their own accord announced that membership charges will be suspended. TSI has not –- and this conduct is the height of corporate greed, lack of empathy and putting profits before people.”**Namorato cites more than a dozen postings from club members on Yelp and Facebook complaining about the charges and urging the company to freeze memberships or suspend fees while the gyms are closed.**A yellow banner across the homepage of the club’s website says facilities are temporarily closed to adhere with state and federal guidelines on Covid-19. “We will miss all of our valued members and whenever this passes we’ll be back at our clubs waiting for you,” it says.**The case is Namorato v. Town Sports International LLC, 20-cv-2580, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.**(Updates with excerpt from complaint in fourth paragraph)""*Edited to include full text, didn't realize it was behind a paywall."

It was Saturday when he began to feel cold and flu-like symptoms.“I just thought it was lack of sleep, and the waking up in the middle of night, and from head to toe just cold and hot sweats, and then all of a sudden dry cough,” says Loiselle.By Wednesday he was being rushed by paramedics to University Hospital in London after speaking to a telehealth nurse.“She asked me ‘Is anywhere on your body numb?’ and I said 'My left arm, my face, and my feet are tingling right now.' Right away she said 'We are sending an ambulance.'”Loiselle says his COVID-19 test came back positive Thursday.He is now in a single hospital room in isolation suffering from a high fever, chest pains, a bad cough, and delusions.“It is a struggle to talk, every time I cough, it feels like from the top of my head pretty much right down to bottom of my back it feels like there’s a million needles just stabbing me.”Loiselle doesn’t know how long he will have to be in hospital, or even if the treatments are helping. He just wants people to know that this can affect anyone and that we all have to take measures to protect ourselves and our loved ones.“This is real, it hurts, I’m 37 and I never thought in a million years, like I told you already I haven’t been sick in 20 years, so when I got this I didn’t think it could happen to me, at all.”"

For all we know factually at this point, you may as well flush these drugs down the toilet and denying them to the people who count on them."

To lock down a city is the last resort, only to be used at the end of means. Previous to this we already suggested that traffic in and out of Wuhan be cut. If it was really possible to achieve ""no in or out"" then there would have been no need to lock down the city. But it was just before Chinese New Year, we cannot possibly archive no traffic. Thus the only option left was the use such drastic measure such as lockdown to control the outbreak. If we did not lockdown then many more cities will become Wuhan, our nation will face unimaginable losses.""""I think 'hair-raising' is the best way to describe the period from 2nd of February till now. The new confirmed cases every day went from four digits, to three digits, to two digits to today's single digit, I believe soon that number will become zero. Once we reach zero we will observe for two more weeks, if no new infection emerges then I will recommend standing down the lockdown on Wuhan.""https://i.imgur.com/de1wy0X.jpgFacing the camera, the aging Li Lanjuan smiles calmly yet her eyes are full of steely determination. Having just finished her check through the ""red zone"" and taken off her isolation suit and mask, her face still retains the markings from her PPE, the so called ""angel's mark"".**From many signs we can see this virus is no longer being transmitted from the seafood market. People, now are the transmission source**Chinese Health: As an epidemiologist, were you familiar with the situation in Hubei and Wuhan before going to Hubei on 18/01/2020? As a member of the high-level expert group from National Health Commission, when you first arrived in Wuhan was the situation on the ground different from what you were expecting?Li Lanjuan: In early January when I heard there was an outbreak in Wuhan I was naturally very concerned and made some calls to colleagues to ask about the situation. Then later, I heard there were medical staff who were infected. This made me realise the seriousness of the situation so I made request to National Health Commission to go to Wuhan to see for myself. National Health Commission quickly agreed and organised a high-level expert team consisting of myself, Zhong Nanshan and four other experts to go to Wuhan and judge the outbreak on the ground. We arrived in Wuha on the night of 18/01/2020.I talked to chief of local hospitals and some other relevant experts and realised there were indeed infected medical staff. I also went to have a look at Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan CDC as well as around the seafood market. That's when I realised that this new coronavirus was indeed spreading from human to human. Man has become the source of infection.**Only by treating it as Class 1 infectious diseases can we isolate and break all transmission**Chinese Health: You recommended ""no in or out"" for Wuhan. Classifying COVID-19 as Class 2 infectious disease but managing it as Class 1 infectious disease. Are those all based on your observations and determination above?Li Lanjuan: YesIf we do not manage this as Class 1 then we are not allowed to do mandatory isolation of patients and close contacts. Back in 2003 with SARS that's what we did too - treating it as a Class 1 infectious disease. Back then we had four imported cases into Zhejiang province. To prevent the further spread we isolated more than a thousand close contacts in one night. Thanks to that there were no second generation patients in Zhejiang and no infected medical staff.Back in January I pointed out, if we are to find and isolate the transmission source we must treat it as Class 1 infectious disease. Only by treating it as Class 1 can we isolate and break all transmissions. That means not only isolating the patient, but also all close contacts.https://i.imgur.com/FKTfPQJ.jpg19/01/2020 closed door meetingOn the afternoon of 19/01/2020, the high-level expert team held a closed door meeting. I spoke first and I presenting a few points:1. COVID-19 is clearly showing H2H transmission. Medical staff in Wuhan have been infected, that's a very important sign telling us H2H transmission is happening and humans are the transmission source. We must manage it as Class 1 infectious disease and isolate all infected to control the outbreak.2. Wuhan has become an epidemic source. With Chinese New Year and its associated large scale movement of the population if we do not take immediate action and control the spread of infected individuals from Wuhan then the outbreak will spread through the country. We have to achieve ""no in or out"", to keep the epidemic contained within Wuhan.3. It's estimated that there are already many infected people. It will be insufficient if we relied on Jinyintan Hospital alone to house the patients. I recommend several hospitals be cleared out and dedicated to treating COVID-19 patients. Only then can we achieve ""accept all patients"", and only then can the medical staff manage sufficient protections for themselves.4. Immediately being medical treatments for both mild and serious cases. It's clear that there are signs of cytokine storm, we should start using the same ""four anti and two balance"" methods used during treatment for H7N9 for these patients, particularly serious condition patients. We could also start to consider stem cell treatments to decrease CFR.5. Immediately begin scientific research, including virus traceability, molecular epidemiological analysis, clinical feature summery, and new clinical treatment research and so on, to use science to give us the means to fight the outbreak effectively.6. Notify the public of the epidemic. Let the people understand the disease. Mobilise all sectors of the society and boost the confidence of the people. Only through mobilising the entire population can we achieve universal alertness against the outbreak.**On 20/01/2020, alarms throughout the nation began to sound**Chinese Health: So how was the recommendation in the closed door meeting disseminated throughout the country?Li Lanjuan: Even as the meeting was still in progress the leadership representative from National Health Commission present at the meeting picked up the phone and called Beijing and reported ""H2H"" and ""manage it like Class 1"" to National Health Commission. National Health Commission treated it with the highest degree of importance and immediately report it up to State Council. As soon as the meeting was over we left for Beijing. On midnight, NHC Chairman Ma Xiaowei met me and Zhong Nanshan and heard our report. Afterwards he decided we needed to report to Vice Premier Sun Chunlan and Politburo next morning.https://i.imgur.com/l1VgKc1.jpgNight of 19/01/2020, NHC emergency meeting08:30 20/01/2020, the six experts arrived in Zhongnanhai. Vice Premier Sun Chunlan heard each of our reports and made it clear she is taking our recommendations very seriously. That day a special meeting was added to Politburo calendar to discuss COVID-19 epidemic prevention and Zhong Nanshan and I were invited to attend. At the meeting Premier Li Keqiang passed along general secretary Xi Jinping's emphasis that the lives and safety of the people are to come first and the outbreak must be controlled. Premier Li Keqiang heard the latest update from NHC as well as from Hubei governor, then he asked us to speak. He heard our recommendations and specifics on outbreak prevention and expressed his agreement. He said ""I thank you two experts and your recommends, this will will provide critical to our next  steps.""Premier Li Keqiang stressed at the meeting: epidemic prevention is a matter of health and safety of the people. All departments and local governments are to follow CPC and State Council's orders and perform their duty to the people, all efforts are to go into outbreak prevention.Once the meeting was over, Premier Li Keqiang and Vice Premier Sun Chunlan came specifically out of the meeting room to bid us goodbye and it moved me. After the meeting State Council immediately ordered: COVID-19 is a Class 2 infectious disease but to be managed as Class 1. on the afternoon of the 20th, State Council and National Health Commission held a teleconference to disseminate prevention effort details nation wide. That day National Health Commission also held a press conference and published our epidemic situation report nationally via the media. On that day alarms throughout the nation began to sound.https://i.imgur.com/oTBfDlR.pngNational Health Commission high-level expert team answering questions from reports regarding COVID-19 outbreak."

When you offered this recommendation did you thought it would cause societal panic, or economic damage to Wuhan?Li Lanjuan: after returning to Hangzhou I kept a close watch on the national epidemic situation. Before leaving for Wuhan on 18/01/2020 I had a call with Zhejiang Health Commission Chairman Zhang Ping and asked him to ""defend"" Zhejiang and prevent any second generation patients. On the night of 22/01/2020 Chairman Zhang called me and said there are large amount of people from Wuhan returning to Zhejiang. They have caused second generation infection and even infection clusters. Soon even more people will come back and cause even greate spread of the virus. In that moment I realised the severity of the outbreak. If Zhejiang cannot hold against the virus then all other cities across the country will soon face disaster. As soon as I hang up I immediately reported upwards: due to latest development in the epidemic situation Wuhan must be locked down immediately, otherwise the consequences will be unthinkable. The lockdown absolutely cannot be delayed to 24/01/2020, the eve of Chinese New year. Otherwise the outbreak will spread uncontrollable throughout the nation.10:00 23/01/2020, Wuhan was locked down. This was a wise decision from CPC and the State Council.https://i.imgur.com/2sglKRy.jpgThere are more than 10 million people living in Wuhan. To lock down a city is the last resort, only to be used at the end of means. Previous to this we already suggested that traffic in and out of Wuhan be cut. If it was really possible to achieve ""no in or out"" then there would have been no need to lock down the city. But it was just before Chinese New Year, we cannot possibly archive no traffic. Thus the only option left was the use such drastic measure such as lockdown to control the outbreak. If we did not lockdown then many more cities will become Wuhan, our nation will face unimaginable losses"

What weapons did you bring with you to help those suffering under the virus in serious conditions?Li Lanjuan: From all the data I saw Wuhan accumulating more and more patients, and the CFR was continuing to climb. As an epidemiologist this troubled me greatly. On 31/01/2020, I submitted another request to National Health Commission saying I was willing to lead a team to support Wuhan. 11:00 01/02/2020, with the blessing of National Health Commission we established in three hours a ten person specialist team consisting of experts in infectious diseases, artificial liver, ICU care and others. We bought with us three big technologies: Li’s bioartificial liver(with which Li Lanjuan is obviously the foremost expert), stem cell and microecology. All the medical equipment for the team filled 30 crates.https://i.imgur.com/SjbMOX4.jpgWe were placed in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University East Hospital. This hospital has been designated by National Health Commission as dedicated to serious condition patients of COVID-19. We arrived in Wuhan on 02/02/2020. At that time the number of patients were growing rapidly. Originally the hospital was meant to house 400 serious condition patients, but due to the sheer number of patients the number was immediately boosted to 800 patients. For a regular hospital, having a few dozen serious and critical condition patients would already be a big deal. Having to take care of 800 was a huge demand on both material and personal. We were short on oxygen, ventilators and PPE. Fortunately more than ten medical teams from ten provinces shortly arrived to reinforce us with medical supplies were right behind them. That gradually decreased the pressure.When we first arrived the mortality rate in the ICU was very high, more than 80%. We used the experience from H7N8 avian flu and applied the ""four anti and two balance"" strategy, applied our three big technologies and it boosted the survival rate of serious and critical patients.There was this surgeon infected with COVID-19, he was showing cytokine storm. After being hooked up to bioartificial liver his cytokine was quickly brought under control and his breathing improved. After three stem cell treatment and small intestine microecology adjustment treatment, the patient remained in hospital for 14 days, after which his PCR test was negative, his lung lesions were largely reabsorbed. After 10 more days he was able to be released.https://i.imgur.com/7RoBxNO.jpgWe worked closely together with local ICU teams. After working day and night we managed to achieve some real results. ICU mortality rate decreased from the original 80% down to below 15%. Particularly those serious condition patients suffering from early stage cytokine storm and treated with bioartificial liver have achieve 100% survival rate.**Two weeks after we achieve zero new confirmed cases, if no new infection emerges I will recommend Wuhan stand down from lockdown**Chinese Health: our nation's outbreak seems to have passed it's peak, does that mean prevention effort can also let up now?Li Lanjuan: I think 'hair-raising' is the best way to describe the period from 2nd of February till now. Back then in the peak of the outbreak we had a lot of patients and not enough isolation, not enough hospital beds and not enough test capacity. I made many suggests to how to deal with these problems. General secretary Xi Jinping personally gave order for ""accept all who need to be hospitalised, treat all who need treatment"". With hard work from everyone the government was able to come up with a total of more than 10,000 hospital beds. Now, all cubicle hospitals have been closed. Wuhan's dedicated COVID-19 hospitals have been aggregated down to ten. The new confirmed cases every day went from four digits, to three digits, to two digits to today's single digit. (18/03/2020 - 24/03/2020, Wuhan's confirmed cases and suspected causes were both zero, this is the first time 'double zero' have occurred since the start of the outbreak)Once we reach zero we will observe for two more weeks, if no new infection emerges then I will recommend standing down the lockdown on Wuhan.https://i.imgur.com/HByiPJP.jpgBut even after lockdown ends we cannot relax our prevention efforts. We must keep a close watch on asymptomatic carriers and those who have recovered and relapsed. We still need to increase prevention control coverage. Anyone having a fever must be sent to fever clinics for test. Also another thing we need to watch out for is overseas. The number of patients globally is increasing rapidly, so preventing imported cases will be another key battlefield. This has the potential to cause a second wave of infection in our nation, so we must hold our ground and not take on step backwards to prevent new outbreaks.Also, at the moment many serious and critical condition patients are still hospitalised, so treatments efforts still need attention. We need to continue and even increase treatment efforts on serious and critical condition patients. At my hospital we still have more than 400 serious condition patients, so we still can't let up."

I know for a fact that a letter has been given to the GC of renovations at the Philadelphia Art Museum declaring it “life sustaining”. Absolute nonsense. On top of that the new Casino/Hotel down by the stadiums in south philly has been re opened only to be shut down for two days for “disinfecting” when two individuals on the site tested positive. How is that going to do anything? In the time they were working there unknowingly positive for the virus they spread it to god knows how many people.Another company who builds luxury multi family apartments has also been granted a pass to continue building.

NEJM article on Ventilator triage; The Toughest Triage,2020-03-27 09:26:26,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fq0048/nejm_article_on_ventilator_triage_the_toughest/,flnv2sy,"[Perspective](https://www.nejm.org/medical-articles/perspective)# The Toughest Triage — Allocating Ventilators in a Pandemic&#x200B;The Covid-19 pandemic has led to severe shortages of many essential goods and services, from hand sanitizers and N-95 masks to ICU beds and ventilators. Although rationing is not unprecedented, never before has the American public been faced with the prospect of having to ration medical goods and services on this scale.Of all the medical care that will have to be rationed, the most problematic will be mechanical ventilation. Several countries, but not the United States, have already experienced a shortage of ventilators. Acute care hospitals in the United States currently have about 62,000 full-function ventilators and about 98,000 basic ventilators, with an additional 8900 in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Strategic National Stockpile.[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689?query=TOC#) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 2.4 million to 21 million Americans will require hospitalization during the pandemic, and the experience in Italy has been that about 10 to 25% of hospitalized patients will require ventilation, in some cases for several weeks.[2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689?query=TOC#) On the basis of these estimates, the number of patients needing ventilation could range between 1.4 and 31 patients per ventilator. Whether it will be necessary to ration ventilators will depend on the pace of the pandemic and how many patients need ventilation at the same time, but many analysts warn that the risk is high.[3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689?query=TOC#)Although shortages of other goods and services may lead to deaths, in most cases it will be the combined effects of a variety of shortages that will result in worse outcomes. Mechanical ventilation is different. When patients’ breathing deteriorates to the point that they need a ventilator, there is typically only a limited window during which they can be saved. And when the machine is withdrawn from patients who are fully ventilator-dependent, they will usually die within minutes. Unlike decisions regarding other forms of life-sustaining treatment, the decision about initiating or terminating mechanical ventilation is often truly a life-or-death choice.Many states have developed strategies for rationing during pandemics. The New York Guidelines target saving the most lives, as defined by the patient’s short-term likelihood of surviving the acute medical episode.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689?query=TOC#) Rationing is performed by a triage officer or a triage committee composed of people who have no clinical responsibilities for the care of the patient. Triage proceeds in three steps: application of exclusion criteria, such as irreversible shock; assessment of mortality risk using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, to determine priority for initiating ventilation; and repeat assessments over time, such that patients whose condition is not improving are removed from the ventilator to make it available for another patient.Anticipating the need to allocate ventilators to the patients who are most likely to benefit, clinicians should proactively engage in discussions with patients and families regarding do-not-intubate orders for high-risk subgroups of patients before their health deteriorates. Once patients have already been placed on mechanical ventilation, decisions to withdraw it are especially fraught. Less than 50 years ago, physicians argued that withdrawing a ventilator was an act of killing, prohibited by both law and ethics. Today, withdrawal of ventilatory support is the most common proximate cause of death in ICU patients, and withdrawal of this support at the request of a patient or surrogate is considered an ethical and legal obligation. Withdrawal of a ventilator against the wishes of the patient or surrogate, however, is primarily done only in states and hospitals that permit physicians to unilaterally withdraw life support when treatment is determined to be futile.Decisions to withdraw ventilators during a pandemic in order to make the resource available to another patient cannot be justified in either of these ways: it is not being done at the request of the patient or surrogate, nor can it be claimed that the treatment is futile. Even though the chances of survival may be low, in the absence of the pandemic the treatment would be continued. Whereas this type of rationing may not be unusual in countries that tragically have a chronic shortage of essential ICU care, it is unprecedented for most physicians who practice in well-resourced countries. Reports from Italy describe physicians “weeping in the hospital hallways because of the choices they were going to have to make.”[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689?query=TOC#)The angst that clinicians may experience when asked to withdraw ventilators for reasons not related to the welfare of their patients should not be underestimated — it may lead to debilitating and disabling distress for some clinicians. One strategy for avoiding this tragic outcome is to use a triage committee to buffer clinicians from this potential harm. We believe that such a committee should be composed of volunteers who are respected clinicians and leaders among their peers and the medical community.Advantages of this approach are that it allows the physicians and nurses caring for the patients to maintain their traditional roles as fiduciary advocates, including the opportunity to appeal the initial decision of the committee when appropriate. While working together to ensure consistent and unbiased decisions across patient groups, the committee also has the flexibility to consider factors that may be unique to a given situation. As circumstances change and the availability of ventilators increases or decreases, the committee can adjust its rationing criteria to produce the best outcomes. Finally, when a hospital is placed in the unavoidable but tragic role of making decisions that may harm some patients, the use of a committee removes the weight of these choices from any one individual, spreading the burden among all members of the committee, whose broader responsibility is to save the most lives.In addition to removing the responsibility for triage decisions from the bedside clinicians, committee members should also take on the task of communicating the decision to the family. The treating clinicians may be motivated to try to comfort the family by telling them that mechanical ventilation is not being provided because it would be futile and by reassuring them that everything possible has been done. Though well intentioned, such inaccurate representations could ultimately undermine public trust and confidence. Having the committee members communicate these decisions would ensure that the message is clear and accurate, helping to prevent confusion or misunderstandings.Similarly, the physicians, nurses, or respiratory therapists who are caring for the patient should not be required to carry out the process of withdrawing mechanical ventilation; they should be supported by a team that is willing to serve in this role and that has skills and expertise in palliative care and emotional support of patients and families. Pain and suffering at the end of life can be controlled, and these patients deserve the best that palliative care can provide.In the weeks ahead, physicians in the United States may be asked to make decisions that they have never before had to face, and for which many of them will not be prepared. Though some people may denounce triage committees as “death panels,” in fact they would be just the opposite — their goal would be to save the most lives possible in a time of unprecedented crisis. Creation and use of triage committees, informed by experience in the current pandemic[2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689?query=TOC#) and prior written recommendations,[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689?query=TOC#) can help mitigate the enormous emotional, spiritual, and existential burden to which caregivers may be exposed."

As is the number of deaths from Covid-19.

He develops a vaccine in his own laboratory in Riehen and tests it on himself. On SRF you can see him injecting 20 micrograms of the vaccine into his leg - even before animal experiments or toxicological tests are completed. According to the SRF report, Burkhard could at best prove in four weeks that the vaccine also produces antibodies in humans.&#x200B;Weighing up the risks&#x200B;The researcher also comments on the risk he is taking: ""What is the risk if I inject the vaccine?

The new coronavirus has a death rate in Italy of around ten percent.&#x200B;""There must be a vaccine as soon as possible. The longer it takes, the more people die,"" Burkhard continues.

If you care about others, people say you're a hippie. If you care about education, you're a nerd. If you follow politics, you're privileged. If you get upset about something, no matter how important, most people will tell you to just calm down.It's like a twisted version of Japanese Stoicism.I'm in Florida and you see it every time there's a hurricane. If you get extra supplies your neighbor or the person next to you in the store will be like ""What the hell are you stocking up for? It's a storm not the apocalypse."" If you evacuate, even when your area is under evacuation advisory, you're told you're overreacting or that you need to turn off the TV/news, or that you should be more skeptical of governments asking you to abandon your private property.We are seeing it with grocery store chains demanding their workers not wear masks because it ""scares the customers"" which really just means ""it's uncool to look like you care about this and all the customers who don't care about this either won't shop here if you do or will cause a scene to prove how much they don't care"".You also see it with all the businesses and business people saying that we need to just go back to regular life and sacrifice everyone who's going to get sick. It isn't just selfishness or individualism or greed that's driving them - it's that the basic American fundamental is that caring about anything is uncool. These folks feel that they weren't caring about it and they don't understand why anyone else is, and are surprised that the American ~~cognitive dissonance~~ naive indifference isn't being universally maintained right now.American culture is, at its heart, a giant feedback loop of ~~cognitive dissonance~~ naive indifference.**Edit** Just to add more data to this fact - look at Trump. He said two weeks ago everything was fine. He said the other day that things would be great by Easter. He said yesterday that he doesn't think anybody needs 30k ventilators. And his approval rating throughout all this is *at an all time high*. Why? Because downplaying things and not caring about them is more American than apple pie and in a time of crisis people want to be assured that not caring is the proper response. It's why his TV show and persona were so popular. Telling someone ""You're Fired"" shows you don't care. Packing people into ICE camps and deporting them shows you don't care. Giving your political opponents silly nicknames shows you don't care. And not caring shows you're not soft."

We didn't need to be freaking out or locking down at all!""Any state that, by happenstance or chance, manages to weather this pandemic without doing a full lockdown will be seen by every other state as ""how our state should have handled things"".America is so big that, quite literally, if it's not on everyone's doorstep they think of it as a problem ""over there"" that has nothing to do with them ""over here"". It's why Bush Jr's ""We Have To Fight The Terrorists Over There So We Don't Fight Them Over Here"" motto resonated so soundly. It allowed Americans to be just afraid enough to care, which was uncool, but told them that they could go back to not caring because the problem and its solution would be ""over there"" where they wouldn't have to actually confront it."

So capitalism offers poor rewards even if making hydroxychloroquine is the right thing to do. Oh and we don't even know that it's the right call; we're not working to the usual standards of medical science.We're in a situation where society could decide to make an expensive bet (although not an unreasonably expensive one in the big picture) but there's no reasonable expectation of profit.If leaders decide to make hydroxychloroquine, they'll have to use emergency economic laws, such as the USA's Defense Production Act. And there's a very real possibility that the bet won't pay out. I don't think our politicians have the guts. The 1% of the 1% can treat themselves by buying out existing supplies, and the rest of us get fucked."

So it causes *almost exactly* the same symptoms as a bizarre chronic infection.The medical drama in *House* is that lupus treatments weaken the chronic sensitivity of the immune system. (Which can improve the acute function. Rheumatology is complicated.) *Treatment can have the dangerous side effect of making an infection worse.* So if you have lupus, you've probably been through a very frustrating time where doctors have been saying ""it's probably not lupus."" It's a reasonably uncommon condition and doctors want to be damn sure they aren't overlooking an actual infection.*House* is about dramatically interesting diseases, and that usually means rare ones, such as infections that are even more rare than lupus."

To know your future, it helps to look at what happened in other countries (China and Korea). I'll use China, since Korea's data is more choppy (their death count is few).  According to [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/) , you'll see daily new cases peaked about 12 days (February 4-5) after lock down (January 23) \[Ignore the big peak on Feb 12, that was the result of changing the criterion for positive diagnosis from using test kits to using chest X-rays\]. Note deaths took longer to peak, with the peak period looking like Feb 12-23. Italy locked down on March 9. Daily increase in cases look like it peaked on March 21, in line with expectation.For reference, you can also get a glimpse of the future for a country like the US. If you compare them against China a week after lock down, you find that US numbers are running at around 7 times China. They too, are likely to peak at 1,000 deaths per day, and headed towards a total of 20,000 or more."

For critical naval vessels like aircraft carries and nuclear subs, let's screen everyone once 24 hours before boarding, once upon boarding, and then daily for first 4-5 days after boarding.   This is the opposite of NBA players, movie stars, and politicians getting tests before everyone else.  If we're spending 750 billion dollars a year on a military that can defend us, they DAMN WELL BETTER be spending whatever it takes to avoid the risk of being crippled by a pandemic.  Which brings me to another thought.It is unthinkable that the Pentagon wouldn't have been considering the unique threat COVID-19 posed to the larger vessels of our naval fleet.  It was surely on their radars (so to speak)  by mid-to-late January, if not sooner.  It's equally unthinkable that they wouldn't have recognized the value of acquiring enough test kits for the kind of focused screening described above.  And whatever the global supply looked like, with 750 billion dollars in their pocket (not to mention simply \*being\* the US military), they would've had no problem locking down some means of acquiring enough kits to keep key vessels COVID19-free. I suspect that by early Feb, many such proposals were being drafted and sent up the chain.  I suspect many of these were approved by all levels of command, all the way up to what one might call the ""commander in chief"".   And I suspect that that chief commander, President Trump, shot them all down.  It wouldn't surpise me if he did so without even reading past the words ""COVID-19"",  thinking  ""FAKE NEWS!"" , and demanding that everyone stop wasting his time with such requests.That's crazy, right?"

If this principle is correct, 40% of cases are concentrated in 1.5% of the territory. Therefore, testing only 1.5% of the population (it would not be exactly that but in that order of magnitude) it is possible to reduce the transmission of the virus by 40%. Lockdown measures seem to reduce the transmission of the virus by 35% per day to around 5% per day, which prevents the number of infected people from multiplying by 65 in 14 days, but still increases it by 50% every 14 days (1-1.05¹⁴ = 1). This is because the lockdown appears to have an efficiency of 85% of a perfect quarantine. If 90% efficiency were achieved, the number of infected would drop by almost every 14 days (1–1.035¹⁴ = 0.6). Doing the massive tests and lockdown simultaneously, the country would have a 50% reduction in the number of infected people every 14 days. If the tests are repeated after these 14 days in the new 1.5% of the population, in 14 days of continuation of the lockdown the number of infected people will drop another 80% (1–1.017¹⁴ = 0.2). If the same process is repeated once more, the number of infected people will drop another 90%. In another 14 days and massive tests it will drop 95%, and then 98%, reaching zero cases for an initial number of infected from 20,000 to 100,000. In other words, the virus would be defeated in 70 days, requiring 3 million new tests every two weeks (which would cost R $ 1.5 billion), and the number of deaths would not exceed 200 across the country. Asian countries managed to identify most of those infected with massive tests and other monitoring measures that only exist there, today they hardly register new cases or deaths and are more concerned with preventing the entry of infected people into the country. These countries did not take full quarantine measures as in Italy because of this high capacity to find infected people in the population. European countries, on the other hand, had to opt for the lockdown to contain the virus, but this measure only extends the epidemic by reducing mortality, it does not defeat the virus as in the case of Asian containment strategies. This measure combining mass tests following the Pareto principle and lockdown seems to me to make some sense at this point and be the best possible solution outside of Asia.Numbers of Brazil"

US cases are just newer. Many people who are not going to make it through have not died yet.For the people below:This disease lasts 3+ weeks. If you test someone and catch them at the beginning of the disease, there will be a time period that passes before their death is recorded. It seems like you people believe that a positive test marks the beginning of the disease and that all people who are tested get tested at the same point of the illness. This is not the case. The US healthcare system is only beginning to be overwhelmed. We have been able to catch a lot of these cases early. For overworked and crowded systems in Spain and Italy, there’s no reason to prioritize someone who is a full week away from critical condition because there are thousands already critical ahead of them in line. Because of this, many of the people getting tested in Spain and Italy are being marked positive when they are much closer to death, and sometimes these people will be recorded as positive and dead on the same day. This is the disparity you are seeing in mortality rates between the US and Europe, it’s not the magical US system somehow doing better than everyone else."

"Alabama governor won’t order shelter-in-place because ’we are not California.’ By population, it’s worse. (FULL TEXT IN COMMENTS)",2020-03-27 10:38:42,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fq1hp8/alabama_governor_wont_order_shelterinplace/,flo34jr,"FULL ARTICLEBy [Philip Bump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/philip-bump/) March 27, 2020 at 10:01 a.m. PDTMillions of Americans continue to live under state-ordered shelter-in-place orders, an effort to contain the spread of the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&itid=lk_inline_manual_2) that’s infected nearly 90,000 people. By containing the spread, officials hope to both better understand the scope of the virus’s spread and reduce the strain on hospitals due to an influx of new cases.Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) doesn’t feel any sense of urgency about implementing a similar order in her state.“Y’all, we are not Louisiana, we are not New York State, we are not California,” she [said](https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/03/26/coronavirus-ivey-says-right-now-not-time-statewide-shelter-place-order/2922242001/) on Thursday. “Right now is not the time to order people to shelter in place.”In terms of raw case totals, that’s true. Data from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) compiled through Thursday show that Alabama’s case total is in the hundreds, compared to thousands of cases in Louisiana and California and tens of thousands in New York.[Image without a caption](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MFEQLELM6FC75GUTH7X4RSKPDE.png&w=1440)But, again, the concern which shelter-in-place orders are meant to address is the *spread* of the virus. And on that metric, things in Alabama don’t compare quite as well.On the graph below, lines which increase more rapidly (have a steeper slope) have seen faster spreads since the tenth recorded case in that state. It’s hard to tell, but Alabama’s line is rising faster than California’s.Over the past seven days, the number of confirmed cases in California has increased by an average of 22 percent each day. The number of cases in Louisiana has grown by an average of 29 percent. In New York, the rate has averaged 33 percent — slightly higher than the 32 percent average increase in Alabama.In other words, the virus has been spreading nearly as fast in Alabama as in New York over the past week. The number of cases in New York from March 19 to March 26 grew by more than 32,000, a 606 percent increase. In Alabama, only 439 new cases were added in that period, but that was a spike of 563 percent.Remember that New York is also more populous than Alabama. This has been a subtext to a lot of the debate over how to limit the spread of the virus, an assumption that less densely populated places have something of a defense against it. If we control for population, though, we see that Alabama’s adding new cases relative to its population faster than New York did. Not as fast as Louisiana, but quickly.As you probably noticed, Alabama is adding confirmed cases far more quickly than California. What might not stand out on that graph is that, relative to population, Alabama’s confirmed case totals are actually *higher* than California’s.About 10.5 people have been confirmed to have the virus for every 100,000 Alabama residents. About 9.9 out of every 100,000 Californians have.We tend to consider the spread of the virus relative not to when it emerged in a region but when it became a focus of the country broadly. Alabama’s got fewer confirmed cases now in part because it didn’t have any confirmed cases until later than other states.It may also be in part because it has conducted fewer tests relative to its population. As of the end of the day on Wednesday, Alabama ranked 40th in terms of the number of tests it had conducted per 100,000 residents.New York and Louisiana have scaled up testing quickly. California’s conducted far more tests than other states, but comparably few relative to its population. It’s still outpacing Alabama, though. (The graph below is adapted from an [analysis of all 50 states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/26/trumps-plan-categorize-counties-coronavirus-risk-has-some-immediately-obvious-challenges/?tid=lk_inline_manual_22&itid=lk_inline_manual_22) that published on Thursday.)The coronavirus cases in California are centered in the San Francisco Bay area. Much of the rest of the state has relatively few cases, even as a function of population. In more-compact Alabama, the number of cases as a function of population is higher in the more northern and eastern counties.Some areas in the state, like Tuscaloosa, already have [shelter-in-place orders](https://www.al.com/news/tuscaloosa/2020/03/maddox-extends-tuscaloosas-curfew-to-24-hours-citing-rapidly-developing-situation.html), a function of local leadership. Ivey’s dismissal of a broader need to limit social interactions may, in part, be a function of where such orders are already in place.Comparing the state more generally to California, though, misrepresents the scale and growth rate of the virus in Alabama."

(They stick those long af, specialized (short supply) cotton swabs up the patients nasal passage so far it scratches the back of the throat and causes all kinds of involuntary reactions like coughing.)  This is good for more than one reason: 1) It reduces the chance of workers getting the virus, 2) it reduces the use of PPE, as testers no longer have to change masks, etc, after every test when they get all up in there, and 3) it relieves the shortage of those aforementioned long af swabs used to scrap the back of the throat through the nose.  There's ample supply of cotton swabs that can reach the top of the nasal cavity for self-testing; by comparison the long af swabs are exclusively made in Germany IIRC (source Gates).So far, this data pertains to USA testing AFAIK.  I hope it or something like it can roll out more widely in the near term, assuming international tests are similar.Bill Gates Ted interview:  ([via Geekwire, (streams FB video)](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/shouldve-done-bill-gates-says-us-slow-covid-19-shutdown-now-unavoidable/) [1:07:29])"

Deaths will necessarily trail the increase in new cases, and the promising news has been that new cases and the percentage of positive tests have been decreasing slightly the last couple days after flattening for the previous 5-6 days.  Specifically, there were 5959 new positive tests out of a little over 33000 new tests, which is an 18% positive rate and in line with the last two days (18% & 16%), after being in the mid-20s for the previous 5-6 days.  Also, 33k tests is significantly more than they ran during the 5-6 day period (which was itself far above what they'd run previously).

When he got to AV hospital, they were able to revive him and keep him alive for about six hours”There doesn’t seem like anything the urgent care place could have done for him with or without insurance.In the US, insured children are covered up through age 26 through parent’s plans under the ACA. If parents do not have insurance, uninsured children still qualify for insurance through a government program called CHIP (to age 19, for families with income too high for Medicaid); and finally there is Medicaid as the last resort. In California, the family income limit for kids to be covered under CHIP is almost $100,000."

When they found out he had no insurance was he told they cant help go to the ER? Or that his situation was so serious he needed to go to the ER? Fact remains a clinic won't see you with no insurance. you have to go to the ER. Maybe he didn't know that. wasted time going to the clinic. The system still sucks. But the clinic likely couldn't have done anything to help him. most clinics are like a doctors office. they don't have an ICU bed.

Instead of it being paid it in 2021 when you file your taxes they are advancing it this year. They are using 2019 filings (or 2018 if your have not filed your 2019 taxes yet) to determine the amount of the credit). If the amount advanced is greater than what you should have received you will not be required to pay it back. If the amount credited is less than what you should have received you will be able to claim the rest on your 2020 tax return. These are not deductions intended to lower your taxable income. These are tax credits meaning the government owes you money. When you get money back on you taxes you are in fact receiving a tax credit. If you owe taxes you have a tax debit. These Coronavirus Credit is just a free credit up to $1200/$2400 for 2020. You will not have to pay taxes on it and it will not affect the amount of taxes you owe or are returned to you.  I hope this helps.

While manufacturers race to ramp production, hospitals and patients need access to real-time utilization data of existing ventilators in operation. Phunware's Knowledge Graph is uniquely suited to track critical data attributes in near real-time, while Phunware's mobile digital front door provides clinicians with everything they need to monitor and track the utilization of key resources like ventilators. However, to do this across the country, we are calling on the medical community to compile a national registry so clinicians and patients have complete visibility of existing resources and patients can find the lifesaving equipment they need."

My entire life has been put on hold until there's a vaccine. I don't know when socializing will be safe for me again. Been living in constant fear for weeks now.

Meanwhile a woman scoffed at me for wearing a mask on my walk this morning. I appreciate that most people are taking this seriously but lots still aren't. Tons of businesses both small and large have deemed themselves essential and I have friends terrified to go into work. Grocery store workers still don't have hazard pay or PPE. Crowds of people swarmed the lakefront two days ago and I'm sure made everything worse. It's heartbreaking.I have a lot of friends who have fled to the suburbs or even more isolated areas.

Hubei police is following ""the letter of the law"" which says lockdown ended and they can travel whenever they want, supported by their people wanting to travel/work/visit relatives - based on CCP official line that the epidemic has ended and economy must restart. CCP will likely step in soon and will decide if the checkpoints are valid(unlikely since they're pretending the outbreak is over and only foreign visitors can spread it)."

For about a month he changed from one snake to another, one rat to another, until one fine day in late November he found a bat - the creatures of the night - the origin of the famous Batman, and the dark lord decided to house the bats.. one after another - every single day he had to shift to another bat.. the people in the city of Wuhan were troubled by the number of dead bats - it never happened earlier. They made a concoction of those dead bats, a form of soup that was delicious to eat, but the recipe of which is so gross I can't begin to write. The Dark Lord, one evening, as he was evicting out of the body of another bat, decided to try a spell he created while flying through a laboratory in the city, and he uttered *corona virusa* as he changed into another bat...

This is stated in a press release. The hope is that the method will soon increase the test capacity in Denmark and other countries that lack the tools for the tests. The method is not as sensitive as the previous standard method used in the first step of a corona test.  But it is considered to have very little significance in the current situation. In step one, many of the problems arise in relation to testing as many as possible.  Here RNA genes are isolated and it usually requires large robots. Also read: Dropped the royal house Here is Meghan's first new job But with the solution from SSI it can be done ""like boiling an egg"", as the consultant at SSI Anders Fomsgaard expresses it to Ekstra Bladet.  It was he who got the idea for the new method. - We do something as simple as taking a swab at grafting and warming it up to 98 degrees for five minutes.  It actually gives as good a result as if you run it on the expensive, fine robots, he tells Ekstra Bladet. SSI is now working to spread the method as quickly as possible, so that others can benefit from it as well.

I'll use what I read through that and another article to reply to this. 1) you start by immersing a grafting scrap into half a mL. of water. 2) you'd use a drop from that and put that into a plastic tube and then put the tube into the egg boiler.3) You punch the machine in to go up to 98 degrees for 5 minutes4) Retesting with the use of the same equipment whereas you add, from what I understand, different compounds and from that, it should give you a result. This should take approx. 2 hours.(Important: This testing method is said to not be as precise, but very, very useful nonetheless, as shortages are seen)"

However, as far as employee reactions I would say yes, everyone is nervous and on edge. People are scared of getting sick and of losing their jobs. Which one they lean towards more depends on their financial situation I would say. Some people are scared to death for their health, especially older folks. Some have plenty of savings or another form of income in the household and just want to stay away from the airport during this time. Some people rely heavily on this income or have partners who have already been laid off in the last 2 weeks and really need the money. They want to work even though they are scared of getting sick because they need to take care of their families. If airports are going to continue to function and have people working throughout this whole pandemic they need to restructure how things are done. There should be PPE available and allowed. There should be way more disinfectant and cleaning supplies available. Everything is backordered. Until Airlines and airports are able to provide protections, workers should not be forced to come to work.Also, protocol can be restructured so that interactions with the customers are done at a distance and without exchanging tickets and credit cards for one thing. I think TSA and flight attendants most especially need PPE and extra precautions. Maybe checked bags are disallowed for the time being. I know it's inconvenient, but so many people touch those bags along the way. Not safe for anyone. Planes could be steam cleaned daily. I don't know the exact answer but I know a lot of additional precautions could be taken to protect employees and passengers."

To clarify when I wrote ""Italy and Spain are saying"" I meant a lot of credible sources in Spain and Italy are saying this is likely the case not that the governments said these things. But yeah statistical analysis is revealing a lot of unaccounted for deaths and doctors on the ground are saying a lot of likely covid patients are dying untested so never get counted (more than half the deaths is what I'm hearing) there's also a lot of people who never go to the hospital or the hospital decides aren't severe enough and send home to isolate and then die and those cases also aren't being counted. There is also the opposite case where in Italy if someone dies from something almost certainly unrelated to Covid 19 but they have a positive test they are counted as a Corona death. I saw like 6 different stories on some variation of this claim in the last 2 days and a few were from doctors on the ground/health ministers.

Once ventilators run out doctors and nurse die the death rate expands exponentially so it’s not an issue of how deadly Corona is but rather an issue of how fast does it exhaust ventilators and ICU beds which in essence makes the death rate at obscene levels for those in need of ICU care.Furthermore testing negative does not mean you become immune. That’s why testing for statistical purposes to assert fact is pure folly. All a negative test shows is that on that particular day you didn’t meet the criteria for testing positive. You could just as easily catch it the next day or a week etc. This is why we are going to have multiple waves until a vaccine is developed. All it takes is for one sick person to spread it all now everyone (no definitive proof that having COVID-19 prevents you from getting it again.... well unless you’re dead) is susceptible to getting again.

At least that’s the experience in my own personal warehouse. I also have a friend in another larger facility and he can also attest to this as well. Sure they talk about it and they leave hand sanitizers on desks, and from what my coworkers tell me since I haven’t returned, they get on the speaker system and remind people to keep apart. But here’s the thing, it’s 100% talk and zero action. Which is why I haven’t returned. It’s not safe. In January someone came to work with the flu and spread it to over a third of the people in just two weeks. The main problem, at least in my facility and how it operates, is there are 4 main rows you work out of with several aisles in that row (44 aisles). They use software to “stow” items in nylon bags that are sorted based on the delivery truck dispatch times. So, everything in row A gets dispatched between 7am and 8am. Row B is 8:30am to 9:30am, etc. So this means every employee on that shift is working in row A. They could most definitely rearrange the stowing program they use to stow items across all rows and stagger the aisles. So instead of the first wave of fleet vans being stored in row A, you could have people picking from A,B,C, and D in such a manner it’s one employee per aisle. But noooo, that’d be too much effort. *eye roll* So instead, everyone gets to clump up together, no mask requirements, coughing and sneezing on everyone and everything, and bumping into each other. That’s not even including exchanging and handling other people’s devices. Amazon needs to take this shit seriously. I could easily step in and suggest changes, but unfortunately I’m not high ranking enough and they all thought I had lost my mind when I gave them the heads up back in February about this so... don’t expect much."

The special protective mask lacks a special EU label and has therefore not been allowed, but following a crisis action by the European Commission, the ban is temporarily lifted.The decision is welcomed by the Swedish Agency for Social Protection and Preparedness, which has called on the Swedish Work Environment Authority to ease the ban.More than 750,000 masks were made for the defense in the 1990s. In 2018, the Swedish Work Environment Authority stopped the use of Protective Mask 90 for, among other things, ambulance personnel and emergency services, since it was developed before Sweden's EU entry and therefore lacks a so-called CE marking that will ensure the quality of products sold within the Union. Only the Armed Forces have been allowed to continue using the mask.The decision by the Swedish Work Environment Authority today means that many masks that are stored in Swedish repositories at various authorities, municipalities and other institutions can be used as an important resource to overcome the acute shortage of protective equipment due to the corona crisis.Annie Sääf[annie.saaf@sverigesradio.se](mailto:annie.saaf@sverigesradio.se)"

We have a team of 5 based in Montreal that travel to NY all the time. We all use our personal vehicles when travelling for work so maybe were lucky in the sense that we arent branded so to speak. Most of our guys have been questioned though, including myself about our frequent border crossings, but fortunately nobody has ever gotten into any sticky situations. And hey, we are in manufacturing too, food and pharmaceutical, we build delivery and packaging systems in Ontario and ship them all over North America for installs. We do maintenance too, if you ever need a case packer or palletizing machine save my reddit name lol. Cheers"

Each test that's done early is worth thousands done later. The lack of early testing is what buggered Italy and the USA IMO.  Also as soon as community spread was noticed they switched gears and focused on tracking and containing clusters of outbreaks already occurring in the province.  Considering our massive population of Chinese living here we would have likely done a lot worse.   These measures were explained in today's health briefing which i found really reassuring and informative.  It seems like the BC government has been handling everything fairly well so far. Lets hope it stays that way and are willing to implement more  measures promptly if needed.

However, it HAS been proved that they do help people stop touching their face, with greatly lowers the number of times you carry all the viruses your hands come in contact with to your nose, mouth, eyes, and noseSo, the masks protects you in that person is sick, protects them if you are sick, and just on the off, off, off, off chance they help when going out , do you think everybody in Asia wears them because they are fashionable and cool?

And once restrictions are lifted it only takes one person from out side to start the spread again. But let's look at a complete lock down.  No body doing funerals for 30 days... that's a long time if your loved one died at home.  What about disabled people that need someone to assist then on day to day basis. Emergency services like a fire stats who puts it out. What if you run out of food during that 30 days no one can deliver you more and shops are shut. Total lockdown scenarios still require essential services to run.  And these people will still catch and spread the virus( there is a lot more people that are essential than you might realise).  Every new case of an essential service worker extends total lock down time.

The number of reported new patients admitted to hospital and Intensive Care appears to be increasing less rapidly.As reported yesterday, the number of patients admitted to hospital and the number of deceased patients is increasing less rapidly then would have been expected without measures in place. If this trend continues, we can conclude in a couple of days whether the measures (keeping distance, limiting social contact, washing hands) are working.The province with the highest number of confirmed cases is still Noord-Brabant with 2488 cases. However, the number of new patients admitted to hospital in this province is decreasing. After that, the most confirmed cases are reported in Zuid-Holland (1249) and Noord-Holland (1235). In these two provinces the number of patients admitted to hospital is increasing relatively rapidly. This is also the case in the province of Gelderland.The provinces of Friesland and Drenthe report the least contaminations with respectively 83 and 81 confirmed cases.More available data on the outbreak of the novel coronavirusRIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment   is receiving more and more information on the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. For example, the latest data from the National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) Foundation is now included in the reports. We provide a daily update on charts and reports in a PDF overview. The figures provided for the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the deaths due to COVID-19 are based on the reports received from the Municipal Public Health Services (GGD). There is a delay between the day on which a person dies and the day on which the death is reported. The number of deceased patients reported per day may include deaths that occurred over the course of several days. The actual number of COVID-19 cases is higher than the number of reports."

They don't want these migrant workers to take the virus to villages because then it will be next to impossible to control. A lot of them are being given food and shelter but huge amount of people have already left on foot. Shows the pathetic nature of their employers also as they couldn't give them 21 days of extra pay which is very small to begin with. Selfish pricks..Edit : Government have stepped in now it seems and most of them are being provided buses. Still a lot of them are stranded. Should be better in 2-3 days I guess.

Businesses are paying their employees these workers are   Equivalent to seasonal workers so they are not permanent to any one employee. Even though all the help is being provided to these people. WhatsApp number was made available where they can gather all this information and contact the right authorities. There are police available at every corner who can be approached for food and housing if you don’t have phone and can’t find the right information.Some media channels created this  shit storm without realizing how it is their responsibility to convey the right information and not create chaos. politics plays a big role in it.

At least that's what SK did and it worked for them as you can limit the spread rather than just randomly testing everyone that's sick just to know how quickly it is growing. The nba is no different than any other massive organization with tthousands of employees all in proximity and traveling the world and even internationally pretty much daily. Also probably helps most teams have their own doctors on payroll.

I can only assume that Vail’s budget projects using the cash from pass sales to fund its operating expenses, including paying salaries and Hourly workers.  If Vail decides to incur those expenses during its shutdown and pays those employees, I’m perfectly happy without a refund. If on the other hand, Vail lays off those employees without pay, the cash they save from such a move should not end up on their balance sheet, but should be returned to pass holders so that we can either help ourselves or those members of our community that need the assistance.

We are absolutely committed to ensuring the needs of our students, parents, and families are met as we navigate these uncharted waters. The administration is working together with teachers, administrators, and education experts to fashion a solution that upholds the health, safety, and education of Michigan students. Next week we will announce our plans to ensure our seniors graduate and that no child is held back as a result of a district’s ability to provide face-to-face instruction during the COVID-19 school closure.”It will be interesting to hear how our students will be making up for lost time.

It can be.  What does this mean?  It means that you can report it to your employer and then go through the workers comp process where your employer will cover medical costs AND due to whistleblower protections, cannot retaliate against you for following the doctor's orders (such as quarantine).  ""COVID-19 can be a recordable illness if a worker is infected as a result of performing their work-related duties. However, employers are only responsible for recording cases of COVID-19 if all of the following are met:The case is a confirmed case of COVID-19 (see CDC information on persons under investigation and presumptive positive and laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19);The case is work-related, as defined by 29 CFR 1904.5; andThe case involves one or more of the general recording criteria set forth in 29 CFR 1904.7 (e.g. medical treatment beyond first-aid, days away from work).""Source: https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/"

Is it really that difficult to prove this was caught elsewhere?  That would depend on a number of things, and not be so clear as you elude to.  An example, no one at your work has been confirmed to have COVID-19, then how would you possibly tie that to being work related?  Secondly, if an employee was confirmed COVID-19, you can simply investigate the employees previous non work related activities and I guarantee there is another more likely exposure given how easily available it is to catch it currently.  This, of course, depends on your physical location in the US.  In my opinion, as a safety professional for 14 years, this can easily be claimed non-occupational.

If you stab another co-worker with a knife(from home), and the injured employee receives sutures to close the wound...its work related.  The injured employee wouldn't have been there if not work work.  This is a very generic example to show the correlation.  There are exceptions, very few, but its important to understand every case is different.  This is what makes record keeping both so difficult and frustrating at the same time.

Many have very detailed plans in place and follow the guidelines. 2. Yes, they can say they instructed social distancing measures and enforced them. If they are exposed to a contractor or customer that is infected they shut down the location and cleaned. They informed individuals who may have come in contact and have them isolate. 3. Contact with bleach on shared surfaces on a schedule with designated individuals to perform the action. You're the safety guy - you're supposed to be one of the people enforcing the organizations plan as you've described above. If it's not being done - doesn't that mean maybe you should get started? Safety is about making sure everyone gets home at night without injury, enforces the safety code (which this kind of plan absolutely is), and works to demonstrate that the organization did in fact prevent the infection happening there."

It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!This ship has been trying to find a port for some time.Edited to add later: on a personal note, I like going on cruises. So there’s some bias when I defend people who got on ships while their governments were still telling them things were fine. That said—I used to be an active poster on Cruise Critic forums. When I realized what was going on with the US numbers being fake (because we weren’t testing) I started posting about it there. (To my knowledge, I was the first person on the site who realized and pointed out that an unnamed cruise ship being mentioned in early news reports must be the Grand Princess based on location and dates, and urged people on prior and future trips to pay attention.) While some coronavirus threads had been going on there for a long time, the site’s moderators deleted many MANY posts, including my posts about the bogus US numbers (back in mid February). Many people who chose to keep cruising were certainly influenced by that site, which is also a travel agency and has (had?) a huge monetary bias in messaging about the disease."

The people of Italy were struggling before this happened, especially after the 2008 recession. The Pope needs to step in and help in real ways, not imaginary ways.

All, clerics as well as laymen, declared that he had toasted to the devil with wine. They said when playing at dice, he invoked Jupiter, Venus and other demons.

I cannot emphasize enough how crude and like worst-case-scenario it is. Especially because the numbers on hospitalization rate to positive test results are all shots in the dark right now as is the estimates of how many tests are happening compared to true instances of the infection.There are estimates out there that the testing is hitting as little as 5% of the cases out there, which is actually a \*super\* positive hopeful guess because that would mean that tons of people have it and aren't getting sick from it. Another sort of reliable number I saw somewhere was maybe the tests are only 50% of the actual number of cases, which is still a more hopeful number because then that also means the number of people out there who've had it are really surviving it just fine. Anyway, that's a bit of a tangent. But, the tool exists. Once I made it, it made me really depressed to see that, like, if you set the fatality rate to 5% and assume it only burns itself out when total population gets it - it doesn't matter how long it takes, thats just 5% of the population dying no matter what - the only thing you can change is how long it takes that baseline death rate to happen and hopefully not add more deaths. Again, VERY CRUDE, mostly worst case simulator, but it's interesting to play with:[http://www.codercowboy.com/coronasim/](http://www.codercowboy.com/coronasim/)"

I’m a union construction worker working on Tennessee street in San Francisco and this job site has nothing to keep you safe from all the people that are coughing,sneezing, people are spitting on the ground. Hardly anyone is doing social distancing. Thanks a lot governor for not taking care of the people that build this country. You are just going to let them die...

We have barely tested anyone, even my friends who have come in contact with tons of cases can't get tested and aren't sent home because they dont have the man power. Every time I go out I rarely see masks or gloves, people aren't social distancing where it counts. People walking up and down grocery aisles coughing in their hands! Seriously! We are going to hit big time, maybe not as bad as NYC but it will come.Compared to what China, S Korea and Taiwan did to contain this, we are doing almost nothing. One of the biggest risk factors is obesity and considering that the US is predicted to have obesity levels in the 40%/pop then we are in for a rough freaking road across the board. I want to be optimistic,  I am generally a very optimistic person, ask my Wife, it almost disgusts her how positive I am. But the writing is on the wall, it has been for months and we missed the chance to avoid and are barely mitigating it. People honestly believe things will be normal by Apr or May, damn I wish I can be that hopeful. But the truth is that this effed up ride hasn't even started yet."

Just a couple things to add to your points. Starting the WFH early was a lifesaver in so many ways. Also, contrary to what you hear around Reddit, people are generally adhering to the social distancing guidelines very well. Even before the shelter in place order, there was quite a bit of social distancing occurring already.Another saving grace right now is the hospital ICU occupancy is actually lower in the city right now compared to usual, meaning as long as the ramp up in cases is gradual we should be able to handle it. The lack of testing was true before, however this week testing has significantly ramped up thanks to Kaiser, CZ Biohub, and the Berkeley IGI. As others have mentioned, we are sitting alright with the hospitalization and death rate right now so even if we are under testing it seems that the majority of cases we are missing are very mild."

Additionally,  you need to take into account how long the incubation period is, it can take weeks to manifest symptoms (or be completely asymptomatic) , and even longer for those vulnerable to start manifesting symptoms that even warrant a physician's attention, death in those that succumb can occur 20+ days after contraction.Im not convinced that we are anywhere near out of the woods,  when we are 30+days into self quarantine and deaths haven't started piling up then I think I'll start relaxing a bit.  But just look back a week or so to NY and no even thought what is happening now can happen. I definitely think the action CA took helped a lot but I think it's still going to hit us harder than most think.I'm just preparing myself for the hammer to fall and I pray that I am wrong. I guess we'll know in another week or two. Just wish we could get some decent testing done .2% of the population isn't nearly enough to even begin to know what is going on.For what it's worth, I really hope you are right."

We also didn't have enough tests, and one of our major airports was one of the 11 still taking in flights from infected countries."

I'm still getting credit for the classes I'm taking and they still will satisfy my degree requirements. So I don't think I would be entitled to a *full* refund.This whole situation sucks. I know I'm not going to receive quite the same education as I would have on campus. And upper-division classes are when you really need to actually *understand* the material, not just bullshit your way through the class for a grade. Most math classes aren't offered online *for a reason.*I kinda think a solution like this may work (with some adjustments):Universities allow students to drop their classes now and they will receive a partial/full refund but they would receive no credit for the classes. Or, the students can remain in their classes and a prorated refund on non-class related things like housing, meal cards, parking passes, etc.SDSU is prorating refunds for parking passes right now. I'm not sure how they are handling the dorms, meal plans, etc. IIRC they are going to refund dorm fees but I don't know if that was confirmed.Either way, I think at *least* a partial refund of some sort should be offered to students."

Some can handle minor injuries, but anything past a broken finger, lanced boil, or stitches they simply are not equipped for.
