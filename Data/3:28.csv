flrag6g,"I can't argue this without a strong degree of hypocrisy since I've only commented on Reddit during the outbreak, but I imagine that voicing opinions will be difficult during the crisis.

Remember when [the FCC received millions of complaints](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/14/570262688/as-fcc-prepares-net-neutrality-vote-study-finds-millions-of-fake-comments) regarding net neutrality, found many fakes or bot-like copy-and-paste comments, and ended up discarding any sentiment by choosing the repeal?

The same may very likely happen with complaints against our government's response. All it takes are bad actors sending a barrage of confusing messages to arm the branches with proof that there's only one way to do something - their way.

>We need competent leadership. Humane policies. Equitable justice.

I absolutely agree with this, but I think we also need some transparent and verifiable system for proving our collective desires. I don't have an answer for the *what* or *how* of such a system, but I think it would really help to squash some flimsy anecdotes like: ""I've heard many people say,"" ""lots of people have told me,"" or ""the public outcry is enormous and without question."" All of which are the backbone of many political statements and motives.","U.S. Tops 100,000 Coronavirus Cases, Testing Kits, Equipment Still In Short Supply",2020-03-28 09:03:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqmvw7/us_tops_100000_coronavirus_cases_testing_kits/

flr892p,"Well, what does ""getting close to the peak"" look like generally? what should one expect to see? The ""peak"" is the situation where you total number of new deaths starts trending downwards, that is, every day the number of new deaths is lower than the day before.  


So just before the peak, you should expect to see that the total number of new deaths is growing, but growing slowly, or even roughly the same, every day. This is almost what we are observing now, a lot of deaths (as should be expected during the peak) but similar, slowly up-trending numbers,  hence the notion that we are close to the peak, hopefully.","Spanish health authorities: “We don’t know exactly when we’ll get confirmation, but we’re getting close to the peak of the curve that we’re studying so anxiously.

We quarantined for 8 days until symptoms waned and went back to work. If it turns out we had it, we're at a massive advantage going forward.

I was wondering if there were any communities draconian enough to purposely infect and isolate young and healthy doctors and nurses well ahead of the surge to try to create a team of immune frontliners.

Both case 268 and 269 (the 2 local cases) had not traveled abroad recently, but case 269 works at Taoyuan International Airport so he's already at higher risk than others

What's concerning though is case 268, as he first showed light symptoms (coughing and sore throat) on **February 28** and wasn't finally tested on March 25, during which he went to the same clinic 4 times and even developed pneumonia on March 20 but was discharged on March 23, then on March 25 he was sent to another hospital after developing symptoms such as fever and diarrhea. It is unknown whether he had had the virus since February or that he just had a normal cold at that time, but what is known is that he **wasn't** tested when he developed pneumonia","CECC confirms 16 more COVID-19 cases, including 14 imported cases - Taiwan Centers for Disease Control",2020-03-28 09:41:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqnkpp/cecc_confirms_16_more_covid19_cases_including_14/
flr8x3e,"Case 268 is super concerning. If he has had COVID-19 for a month, the amount of people he's exposed (that they won't be able to trace) both in and out of the healthcare system could be a lot.

Hopefully, he was responsible (limiting time out, wearing a mask, washing hands etc.), but as we saw in Korea, one infected person can cause a huge chain reaction.

I do wonder when Taiwan is going to loosen their testing criteria. (Also, what is their capacity?) Most of the people they have tested were contacts of confirmed traces, and people who had pneumonia and tested negative for the flu (supposedly? but this guy didn't get tested, so who knows?). As we know, pneumonia only occurs in ~20% of cases--if this is in the community, many more people could have it that don't meet Taiwan's current testing criteria.","CECC confirms 16 more COVID-19 cases, including 14 imported cases - Taiwan Centers for Disease Control",2020-03-28 09:41:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqnkpp/cecc_confirms_16_more_covid19_cases_including_14/

Our current criteria is actually pretty loose already, if a doctor finds a patient highly suspicious then the doctor can decide to test the patient, it made sense that a doctor would not have found case 268 too suspicious when he first showed symptoms as he had not traveled abroad nor was he in close contact with anyone returning from abroad, but I have absolutely no idea why he wasn't  tested when he had developed pneumonia.","CECC confirms 16 more COVID-19 cases, including 14 imported cases - Taiwan Centers for Disease Control",2020-03-28 09:41:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqnkpp/cecc_confirms_16_more_covid19_cases_including_14/

THIS HAS NO TITLE EDITED NOR [THIS ONE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fql5yc/due_to_coronavirus_polands_pis_change_electoral/)

There's presidential election in May 2020 and at 3 am Saturday 28.03.2020 Poland’s parliament passed a law allowing postal voting for senior citizens and those in quarantine or self-isolating. According to many lawyers such a law is illegal and unconstitutional.

1. Unconstitutionality in relation to the Constitutional tribunal rulings that such changes cannot be made up to 6 months before any election.
1. Uneven access to voting. Every citizen needs to vote the same way if he is 18+.
1. “Fill Grandma’s election card”.
1. Election card thrown in the postal box after 2:00 am the next day

Not to mention that there will be no debates, there will be no campaigns, Andrzej Duda will be on the shown from morning to night in the government media in the upcoming months. Nobody will go out protesting because many people are scared of the coronavirus. Many young people won’t vote because they will be afraid to catch the virus.

flr6tw7,"Yeah. The model predicted a peak of 260 daily deaths in the UK in about a weeks' time. 260 people died yesterday.

Really the paper was a little bit naive. Their modus operandi was basically to assume whatever happens in China happens elsewhere, line up the curves with whenever the lockdown started, and draw the rest of the graph.

The predictions for Germany and the Netherlands seem to be wildly off too. According to this guy's model, they've already peaked, with many more deaths than have actually happened, while in reality, both countries are still rising, and Italy's prediction is somewhat under the model.","Coronavirus: UK will do well to keep deaths below 20,000 - NHS official",2020-03-28 09:43:09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqnm2a/coronavirus_uk_will_do_well_to_keep_deaths_below/

flr7qdu,"Not true. It's a different model entirely with different authors.

The earlier paper, the one that said under 20k would be a success, and the deaths would be ~400k if we did nothing - came from a large team of actual epidemiologists, and uses an actual epidemiological model.

The latest paper, the one with the 6k figure and the prediction which has already failed for three countries - is barely a model at all, just an exercise in graph fitting. It's the work of some electrical engineer either trying to get his work into the papers, or maybe finding an excuse to leave the house and go into uni, now that everyone at ICL should be working from home, apart from the Covid-19 researchers.

flrsj5n,"This scenario scares the fuck out of me. My dad is going away on business on Monday. I was one of the lucky few that started preparing for isolation and the possibility of limited or no access to medical care in February. But my 70-year-old dad still has to work. He manages a chain of power plants and frequently has to travel to inspect parts that aren't working and decide how to fix them. I've begged him to stay home; he's said power plants need his work and skills in-person to function. I've even thought about emailing HIS boss, the CEO, to politely beg him not to make my dad do this. I want to, so badly, but I realize my dad could get fired if I cross boundaries like that. I would call, but my husband and my mother have asked me not to. I'm going to feel so guilty if my dad dies because I didn't stop him from traveling.  

This Friday, we started a garden together, not just to make sure we can eat during the Greatest Depression, but to spend time with him. He grew up on a farm and loves this stuff. Today, my nocturnal ass got up at 8 am and he made me chocolate chip pancakes like he used to do every Saturday when I was a kid. I've been crying ever since I found out about the business trip and I'm treating every moment with my daddy like it could be the last. Because it could. 

God damn it. My dad, working with other engeneers and techs on power plants, knows all about the importance of following safety protocol. I gave him an N95 mask I was saving for an occasion like this, hand sanitizer, lysol spray, and alcohol wipes. I told him to not touch his face, treat the atmosphere and every surface like it was toxic, six feet or more apart from everyone no matter what, sterilize fucking everything. I said, ""Dad, I love you. Out of every set of safety regulations you've ever learned in your life, these are the most important."" He promised me he will follow them. I'm still terrified, and as Monday gets closer and closer I'm beating myself up for not calling Dad's boss and putting a stop to this business trip. I feel like I'm letting my daddy die.

flraias,"A little of both. MN is a pretty highly-educated state. But the main point of the article is that Gov. Walz implemented some drastic measures before other states did. Rather than taking a wait-and-watch approach, MN has been more proactive rather than reactive, compared to most other states. He also acknowledges that spread is inevitable. His plan mainly involves pushing the peak infection rate out as much as possible to give the healthcare system time to prepare (acquiring equipment, opening more hospital beds, etc.).

Not in the article, but I'll also add that MN did as much as possible to make the unemployment situation bearable. Before closing businesses, MN lifted any waiting periods for unemployment insurance, so we could start getting paid immediately (I was laid off when businesses closed a couple weeks ago). They also opened up special enrollment for healthcare coverage.

The country has drawn global attention with an unorthodox approach while its neighbors have imposed extensive restrictions.

By Christina Anderson and Henrik Pryser Libell

March 28, 2020Updated 12:28 p.m. ET

STOCKHOLM — When the coronavirus swept into the Scandinavian countries, Norway and Denmark scrambled to place extensive restrictions on their borders to stem the outbreak. Sweden, their neighbor, took a decidedly different path.
While Denmark and Norway closed their borders, restaurants and ski slopes and told all students to stay home this month, Sweden shut only its high schools and colleges, kept its preschools, grade schools, pubs, restaurants and borders open — and put no limits on the slopes.
In fact, Sweden has stayed open for business while other nations beyond Scandinavia have attacked the outbreak with various measures ambitious in scope and reach. Sweden’s approach has raised questions about whether it’s gambling with a disease, Covid-19, that has no cure or vaccine, or if its tactic will be seen as a savvy strategy to fight a scourge that has laid waste to millions of jobs and prompted global lockdowns.

By Saturday, Norway, population 5.3 million, had more than 3,770 coronavirus cases and 19 deaths; Denmark, population 5.6 million, reported 2,200 cases and 52 deaths; Sweden, with 10.12 million people, recorded more than 3,060 cases and 105 deaths.

A recent headline in the Danish newspaper Politiken, encapsulates the question ricocheting around Europe, “Doesn’t Sweden take the corona crisis seriously?”
There is no evidence that Swedes are underplaying the enormity of the disease rampaging across the globe. The country’s leader and health officials have stressed hand washing, social distancing and protecting people over the age of 70 by limiting contact with them.
But peer into any cafe in the capital, Stockholm, and groups of two or more people can be seen casually dining and enjoying cappuccinos. Playgrounds are full of running, screaming children. Restaurants, gyms, malls and ski slopes have thinned out but are still in use.
The state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said in an interview that Sweden’s strategy is based on science and boiled down to this: “We are trying to slow the spread enough so that we can deal with the patients coming in.”
Sweden’s approach appeals to the public’s self-restraint and sense of responsibility, Mr. Tegnell said. “That’s the way we work in Sweden. Our whole system for communicable disease control is based on voluntary action. The immunization system is completely voluntary and there is 98 percent coverage,” he explained.
“You give them the option to do what is best in their lives,” he added. “That works very well, according to our experience.”
Sweden’s method flies in the face of most other nations’ stricter strategies. India is attempting a lockdown that affects 1.3 billion people. Germany has banned crowds of two or more people, except for families. In France, residents are asked to fill in a form stating the purpose of each errand when they leave their homes; each trip requires a new form. Britain has deployed police officers to remind residents to stay home.

Still, while Sweden may appear to be an outlier in Scandinavia and in much of the wider world, it is too soon to say whether its approach will yield the same results as other countries’. And the Swedish authorities could still take stronger action as coronavirus hospitalizations rise.

In explaining Sweden’s current strategy, experts point to other underlying factors: The country has high levels of trust, according to the historian Lars Tragardh, and a strict law in the Constitution prohibits the government from meddling in the affairs of the administrative authorities, such as the public health agency.
“Therefore, you don’t need to micromanage or control behavior at a detailed level through prohibitions or threat of sanctions or fines or imprisonment,” Mr. Tragardh said in a phone interview. “That is how Sweden stands apart, even from Denmark and Norway.”
The government has deferred to the agency’s recommendations to fight the virus, which has infected more than 600,000 people and killed more than 27,000 worldwide by Saturday. If the health agency were to say that closing borders and shutting down all of society was the best way to go, the government would most likely listen.
Mr. Tragardh said Swedes’ level of trust was manifested in other ways: Not only do citizens have confidence in public institutions and governmental agencies and vice versa, but high social trust exists among citizens, as well.
That is evident in the country’s approach to the virus. Norway did not completely shut its 1,000-mile land border with Sweden, but most people returning from abroad must enter a two-week quarantine (Reindeer herders and daily commuters are exempt.) Finland closed the borders of its most populous region — which has 1.7 million people and includes the capital, Helsinki — for three weeks to fight the outbreak there.
Norway limited groups outdoors to no more than five people, and those indoors must keep a distance of more than six feet (except relatives). Denmark closed its borders, sent public workers home with pay and encouraged all other employees to work from home. It shut nightclubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and shopping centers, and banned gatherings of more than 10 people outdoors.
Sweden initially banned gatherings of 500.

Early in the outbreak, some event organizers suggested they would try to get around the crowd limit by allowing precisely 499 ticket holders into their venues. (That stopped when cases of Covid-19 were confirmed among staff members.)
Mr. Tegnell, the state epidemiologist, said that is why bans don’t work: “People find ways around the rules.”
He also said he did not believe Sweden was a maverick and did not understand its neighbors’ strategy. “Closing borders at this stage of the pandemic, when almost all countries have cases, to me does not really make sense,” he said. “This is not a disease that is going to go away in the short term or long term. We are not in the containment phase. We are in the mitigation phase.”
He also said that closing schools had not been ruled out.
The Netherlands, which reported more than 9,700 cases of the virus and 639 deaths by Saturday, is taking a similar approach to Sweden’s. On March 16, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said his country of 17.1 million was opting for a “controlled spread” among groups at the least risk of getting seriously ill. He argued that it was too late to shut down the country “completely.”
A majority of Swedes, 52 percent, support the measures to contain the virus, according to a survey conducted by the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet and published on Tuesday. But 14 percent said that too little consideration was being given to public health in order to benefit the economy.
There is growing concern as Swedes prepare to travel to their country houses and to the ski slopes for Easter, even though the public health agency has asked citizens to reconsider such trips. (Norway announced a “cabin ban” to prevent residents from going to their country homes.)

Even Prime Minister Mette Fredriksen of Denmark issued a warning about its neighbor on Monday: “Don’t go on a ski vacation in Sweden!”
Last week, a cluster of Covid-19 cases was traced to an après-ski party at a Swedish alpine center, Are, prompting officials to close an aerial tram and gondola and shut bars and nightclubs. Hundreds of Covid-19 cases in Scandinavia have stemmed from vacationers returning from ski trips in Italy — which has the most cases in Europe — and in Austria.
Now, there is a petition on social media to close the ski slopes.
Some Swedes have suggested that their country is deviating from most other nations’ response to hasten herd immunity, risking lives unnecessarily.

The public health agency denies this.
In the meantime, the infection curve in Sweden has started to rise sharply, and on Friday the government tightened the limit on crowds to no more than 50 people.
Some residents like Elisabeth Hatlem, a hotelier, are of two minds about the Swedish approach. She is grateful that she can keep her business open. But she and her partner do not like sending their six children to school amid the pandemic.
“For us, a total lockdown is a disaster,” she said. “But I am worried Sweden will explode at some point. I feel like I’m living in a huge experiment, and I was never asked if I wanted to sign up.”

My girlfriend lives in one of the locations with the highest infected rate in Sweden, whereas I actually live in the place with the lowest infected rate (well, one of the lowest). I don't really want to risk being a silent carrier and taking it back home, so I have been here a while now.

ANYWAY,

1-2 weeks ago, the shops were hectic for a couple of hours. Then it completely died down. Emptiness,even at peak times of the day.

Now, if I look outside (and I went for a walk earlier to the shop), it seems that for many life has gone back to normal. Like, you wouldn't even be able to tell it was an issue.

The shops that had Coronavirus signs up have now taken them all down. There were gloves that you were meant to put on if you walked around the shop. Nobody takes them now.

You wouldn't know anything was amiss if you weren't keeping up with the news. The only thing I noticed today was that a few of the cheaper canned goods had been sold out overnight, but I think this is more due to the shop being 'new' (i.e. opened a week ago), and they didn't really plan to sell out of stock too quickly when the shop was planned.",In Coronavirus Fight Sweden Stands Apart,2020-03-28 10:11:07,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqo4j8/in_coronavirus_fight_sweden_stands_apart/

* They gave a $50 Publix gift card to associates as a bonus. Since they can only spend it at Publix, it costs them ~~nothing~~ *far less than the face value of the card \[edited\]*, but the associates are going to be taxed for it since it was not a gift.
* In my area testing is not yet widespread without negative results for flu despite symptoms and results take days to return.  Publix sick pay is up to the discretion of management. If you need time off and think you have COVID-19, you will have to forfeit your Christmas bonus unless you get a positive test. If you use sick time, it counts against your next performance review.
* They claim they cannot afford employees taking time off due to sickness, despite the fact that they had a 94% increase in their 2019 4th quarter earnings over 2018. They are having a banner quarter right now as well.

People ideally would bring their own stuff, go directly to their own property, and hole up there for 2 weeks just to be considerate neighbors.

THIS IS NOT A PURELY POLITICAL POST BECAUSE THE LEGISLATION IS CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS NOR [THIS POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqnlnw/polands_sham_presidential_election_in_a_pandemic/) IS POLITICAL.

There's presidential election in May 2020 and at 3 am Saturday 28.03.2020 Poland’s parliament passed a law allowing postal voting for senior citizens and those in quarantine or self-isolating. According to many lawyers such a law is illegal and unconstitutional.

1. Unconstitutionality in relation to the Constitutional tribunal rulings that such changes cannot be made up to 6 months before any election.
1. Uneven access to voting. Every citizen needs to vote the same way if he is 18+.
1. “Fill Grandma’s election card”.
1. Election card thrown in the postal box after 2:00 am the next day

Not to mention that there will be no debates, there will be no campaigns, Andrzej Duda will be on the shown from morning to night in the government media in the upcoming months. Nobody will go out protesting because many people are scared of the coronavirus. Many young people won’t vote because they will be afraid to catch the virus.

Not everything grows everywhere and it’s better to get your knowledge from local people first and the internet second. 3) start composting because the end result is fertile soil aka Black Gold.

Hopefully nation-wide soon available tests and hopefully free. They're also turning down possibly those with mild symptoms, to just go home and quarantine, and do self-remediation, self-care for 10-14 days. We do not want to charge anything outstanding, so the tests should be free, as ordered by Federal and National government.

The protocol to not go to the hospital if you have mild systems should be and hopefully is rolled out, as being in line or having anxiety in a hospital can further complicate any symptoms, and only makes it worse for the patient that has only mild symptoms, and makes it more difficult for the doctors. If you have mild symptoms you self-quarantine and self-remediate with at home remedies.

Do not call ambulance and emergency lines for mild symptoms as this only creates unnecessary, and you also create more risk for yourself since anxiety, the anxiety that can happen while waiting in line can lower your immune system and put yourself at more risk. And you may get denied in hospital for queue as hospitals may be only taking in more serious symptoms and patients with more complications.",BGI’s real-time Covid test wins FDA approval,2020-03-28 11:04:10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqp4op/bgis_realtime_covid_test_wins_fda_approval/

US has several manufacturing companies who makes n95 masks such as 3M & Honeywell. As I understand, they are currently maximizing their production and even adding new lines to answer to the growing demand for n95 respirators. Now after manufacturing, comes the ""independent medical distributors"". They are sort of like the medium between manufacturing and hospitals and other companies that are looking for such supplies. 

The current problem now lies in these independent distributors. I don't know exactly how these distributors are managing their supplies. But from what I think Gov Cuomo is implying by saying the what used to be an 85cents mask is now $7each, these distributors are trying to milk as much money as they can from the current crisis.

And so if this is the case, is there really a shortage of masks or we are just trapped in between the betting and bidding between states?

It is a summary of how people are behaving

People are just fearfull because there is something called margem sul where there is a huge amount of trafic (usually) because people there normally work in places like lisbon...And when you say south, youre kinda implying margem sul too...

The Algarve (actual south) is actually doing a great job at preventing circulation and plus without the added tourism variant, we have a pretty low density population, were like 400k, preventing 400k people from doing dumb things is achievable",Sunny day in Portugal.

>About 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create such a vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates they have been testing in animals. The first of these – produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna – will enter human trials imminently.

>This unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.

>When will we discover a vaccine for a family of viruses that we have never been able to develop a vaccine for before?

>Across the United States, prized chickens are laying life-saving eggs at secret farms.

>For the past 80 years, much of the world has relied on chicken eggs for the production of influenza vaccines.

>There is no vaccine yet for the virus; and because it's different than the influenza virus, traditional methods like using eggs won't work. As scientists race to find a cure, the huge US stockpile of eggs won't be of any help.

flscuzs,"It's not that unusual, and I'm surprised this hasn't been explored more - a lot of lung-related diseases benefit from immunosupressive treatments.

The reason being is that what *really* gives you pneumonia isn't the virus, but it's your own immune system when it releases a cytokine storm. It's sort of like a ""nuclear option"" your body decides to do when the infection is widespread enough or takes long enough to beat. This nuclear option is very good at killing virus fast, but it also kills healthy cells. If it goes on too long, your body will damage itself beyond the point of no return and then you develop serious pneumonia, killing you.

Generally speaking, your immune system is very good at what it does but it can sometimes be too good and not know when to chill. Immunosuppressants basically force your immune system to ""chill"", which stops the pneumonia, and then when the body resumes its attack hopefully the virus is still being attacked well enough to actually be defeated without requiring your body to go nuclear again.",I'm a doctor at Italy's hardest-hit hospital.

flrmnoj,"*Two critical mutations in the bat coronavirus set us on the path to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first modified the structure of the spike-like structures that protrude from the virus. Those protrusions give the virus its family name: “Corona” means “crown” in Latin. The altered spikes allow the virus to latch onto a protein called ACE2, which lines the respiratory tract. The related virus responsible for the SARS epidemic employs a similar infection mechanism, as does another bat coronavirus that causes common colds in humans.*

*The second key mutation allowed the coronavirus to grow a protein dagger called a furin, which can slice through other proteins to make the virus bind tightly to throat and lung cells. The furin protein is what made the COVID-19 virus so infectious and deadly to humans. In that sense, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to anthrax and various bird flus that also rely on furins to carry out their infection.*",How Genetic Mutations Turned the Coronavirus Deadly | Nautilus,2020-03-28 12:21:00,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqqkmg/how_genetic_mutations_turned_the_coronavirus/

flsrp0r,"Chloroquine was mentioned as a possible treatment for AIDS in the 80s. 

I wish more people would read How to Survive a Plague right now. The rush to get some kind of treatment led to AZT, which turned out to be iatrogenic. For people close to death, it could be life saving, but for otherwise healthy HIV-positive people, long-term use weakened their immune systems. 

The book also offers a less-flattering perspective on Anthony Fauci. Tens of thousands of people with AIDS died of pneumonia who might have been saved by prophylactic prescriptions for Bactrim. When activists begged him to issue guidelines advising doctors to prescribe Bactrim to patients at risk, he refused.

Adam Bernheim got a good hard look at the enemy well before it invaded his own hospital. The white, round-shaped spots he saw clinging to the edges of people’s lungs formed a pattern unlike any he had seen in patients suffering tuberculosis or any other respiratory disease. This was January, and Bernheim, a cardiothoracic radiologist with the Mount Sinai Health System, was studying CT scans sent from China with a researcher’s dispassionate eye.

“It was very unusual,” said Bernheim, whose long-standing partnership with West China Hospital in Chengdu and three other hospitals in different provinces gave him early access to their images, the first glimpse of the coronavirus now rampant in New York.

Nothing that Bernheim saw in those scans could have prepared him or other doctors for the onslaught of patients a few months later as New York City became the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, with more than 25,000 cases and 366 deaths as of Friday. In hospitals across the city, emergency rooms are swelling, beds are filling and intensive care units are becoming overwhelmed, with the projected peak still a week or two away.


On Tuesday night, emergency medical services workers received 6,406 medical 911 calls in the previous 24 hours, surpassing the total from Sept. 11, 2001, and the numbers keep mounting, said Oren Barzilay, president of Local 2507, which represents emergency medical technicians and paramedics of the New York City Fire Department.

Now Bernheim is seeing those distinctive patterns again, this time as a clinician on scans taken in his own emergency department. “One after another after another after another,” he said. “Yesterday more than the day before. In all ages. Men and women.”

The Mount Sinai Health System is better positioned than most to weather the storm sweeping the city. It is a well-funded, world-renowned research and academic center. It has invested in data modeling to plan for how many beds and intensive care units hospitals need. But it, too, may be nearing a tipping point as the disease consumes unprecedented resources and puts relentless pressure on nursing staff who sweat under layers of personal protective equipment.

“This is a fluid situation,” said Ugo Ezenkwele, chief of emergency medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in Queens. “In a week or two, who knows? … This is unique in my experience, and I’ve been doing emergency management since 2002.”

Hospital leaders had anxiously watched previous outbreaks, including the H1N1 flu and Ebola, and prepared for a pandemic they knew some day would come. “Now that day has come,” said Charles Powell, chief of the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

As well equipped as Mount Sinai is, doctors on the front lines battling covid-19 are fearful they too could be overwhelmed. They are keenly aware of the harrowing stories from nearby hospitals, including Elmhurst in Queens, where 13 patients succumbed to the virus in a single day. Many were chilled by recent news that a 48-year-old assistant nursing manager at Mount Sinai West had died of the disease.",Inside a major New York City hospital system battling coronavirus,2020-03-28 12:38:37,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqqw9f/inside_a_major_new_york_city_hospital_system/

flrwwpz,"So I am nurse, not an OB nurse but I frequent many other medical subreddits. It is a good thing that the governor did this because the absolutely no visitor rule was making women desperate enough to travel to other states to have their babies. It has been an increasingly frequent story that “my hospital had a patient come from New York to have their baby”. Or I have read in pregnancy subreddits that pregnant patients themselves saying they are going to another state to have their baby because of that rule. 


I don’t think people understand the fear that the thought of giving birth alone gives a woman. And sure, they aren’t actually physically alone in a hospital but emotionally they are. And that is why pregnant woman are fleeing the state for other hospitals.

flscljz,"Y’all who are criticizing this...you know that most hospitals don’t have well baby nurseries anymore, right? When I had my daughter, I was in labor for three days, during which I didn’t sleep. By the time I made it to the postpartum ward I was so exhausted I was nearly hallucinating. If my husband wasn’t there to help care for our daughter I might have accidentally dropped her or fallen asleep feeding her. And I had a relatively uncomplicated birth—there are moms who need their partner to pick the baby up and give it to them because they just had abdominal surgery, who tear so bad it’s difficult to walk, who are impaired from pain meds. What are women like them supposed to do when they’re alone with a newborn at 3am in the hospital? My nurse helped out when she could, but I wasn’t her only patient. She couldn’t have given me the kind of help my husband did. Overall the system assumes that the support person and the new mom are the ones doing 100% of the care. 

If this were the 1950s where the baby was cared for in the nursery by a full team of nurses and brought to mom every few hours while she recovered, I would be ok with banning support people. But that’s not the reality. The system assumes that the support person is there during recovery.

flrtizd,"My wife and I just discharged today from the hospital with our newborn. The hospital had a one visitor policy with very stringent rules while were admitted (no walking halls, no food delivery, nurses/doctors wearing face masks at all times). My wife had an emergency c section, and I was still allowed in the OR. I will say that although it was a very nerve wracking experience with all the COVID scare going on, you have to remember that most women’s hospitals aren’t taking in emergency cases like COVID for treatment. So although the risk is still there, it’s much lower compared to being at an inpatient hospital with an emergency center. Of course, not all women deliver at women’s hospitals, so just do your research and call the hospital before you go!

flrym3t,"For labor and delivery, the Department considers one support person essential to patient care throughout labor, delivery, and the immediate postpartum period. This person can be the patient’s spouse, partner, sibling, doula, or another person they choose. In these settings, this person will be the only support person allowed to be present during the patient’s care. This restriction must be explained to the patient in plain terms, upon arrival or, ideally, prior to arriving at the hospital. Hospital staff should ensure that patients fully understand this restriction, allowing them to decide who they wish to identify as their support person.

flrpesa,"""Research just published by the Linterman lab shows that the immune system of older mice can be given a helping hand by applying immunology expertise and some genital wart treatment (don't try this at home just yet)! 

Mice and humans show similar age-dependent changes in their immune system so this finding offers hope for easily increasing the robustness of vaccination response in the older population.

As we age, the function of our immune system declines, rendering us more susceptible to infections, and making us less able to generate protective immunity after vaccination. By understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin this poor response in older individuals, researchers in the Linterman lab were able to repurpose an existing treatment for genital warts, and demonstrate that this was effective in overcoming the age-related effects on two of the many cell types making up our immune system. The research is published online in the journal eLife.

flrwdex,"Because of the abjectly incompetent handling of our federal government, the US is handling this virus like 51 separate countries (50 states + DC) right now, not one country. So there's competing for resources, confusion, suspicion, and very inconsistent approaches. But even within states some cities are getting hit harder than others (eg LA and SF).

So some states are handling it well (eg Ohio), some okay (eg California, Washington State), some are really struggling (eg New York State), and some are about to get totally fucked (eg Louisiana). But even the 'well' and 'okay' states are going to get hit very hard. So it's all relative.

We are facing lots of deaths, a ton of sickness (most of which can be handled fine in isolation at home), totally overwhelmed healthcare services and personnel, medical supply resource shortages, widespread (hopefully temporary) unemployment, and a fucked economy.

I'm not trying to be a downer or an alarmist here. I'm just being realistic, based on the situations in Italy and Spain, and our own botched approach. Everyone with their eyes open and a brain can see this (so a *lot* of people here). But there are still many who are deep in denial for various reasons.

But we will get through this together!

flrvcck,"The Abbots test is based on a Belgium immunoassay and is described as rapid but giving only a 70% sensitivity:

 Leading virologist Marc Van Ranst commented on the test: The new antigen test will certainly speed up diagnostics in hospitals, because in fifteen minutes there will be results. If the result is positive, there is certainly an infection. If the result is negative, there remains uncertainty because the sensitivity is only 70 percent. To obtain certainty, in a number of cases, such as hospitalisation, the lab test will still be carried out if the result is negative.

It is not clear what region of the viral protein the antigen of this test is derived from, but other immunoassays have been described in the literature recently which are capable of 97.5% sensitivity using the CHO-expressed full-length  SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins.  This was described on the health science preprint server [medrxiv.org](https://medrxiv.org) on 3/27/20.

>During the past week, Sue O'Brien has written on Facebook of the health progress and setbacks of her husband, Ted, a former state senator stricken with COVID-19. On Friday evening, she agreed to allow those posts to be used here publicly.

>""Go ahead,"" she wrote in a message. ""This is about saving lives.""

>Her daily postings likely echo the quiet and unspoken sentiments of many families, who have watched their loved ones fall prey to the swelling pandemic. They speak of sudden turns for the worse, of glimpses that health is improving, of medications that might or might not help, of the stings of isolation as they too are quarantined and their ability to connect with their spouse or sibling or partner or parent is limited.

>""I have learned that it can't be determined whether Ted will survive, and what I have realized and accepted, is that Ted's life gift is teaching the doctors how to treat this disease in its most serious forms,"" she wrote in the late afternoon Friday. ""He has always been a generous man, to me, his kids, his family and friends, and regardless of how this turns out, his generosity is now helping humanity.

>... So, this is the reality, folks. It's a disease that claims lives indiscriminately, and sometimes way quicker than Ted. We still have him. Other families, here in Rochester and all over the world, have lost someone way too soon and suddenly. We owe it to humanity to do our part.""

And: 

>In a telephone interview that day, O’Brien told the Democrat and Chronicle that he had not had some of the more-common symptoms, such as a fever and cough. He was unsure where he contracted the disease.

[....] 

>Within four days of that interview, O’Brien, 63, was in the intensive care unit at Rochester General Hospital.

BY EDNA ST. VINCENT MILLAY

To what purpose, April, do you return again?

Beauty is not enough.

You can no longer quiet me with the redness

Of little leaves opening stickily.

I know what I know.

The sun is hot on my neck as I observe

The spikes of the crocus.

The smell of the earth is good.

It is apparent that there is no death.

But what does that signify?

Not only under ground are the brains of men

Eaten by maggots.

Life in itself

Is nothing,

An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.

It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,

April

Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.","How bad will the next few weeks be for California as coronavirus cases explode?

- No priority for healthcare workers. It is assumed that someone who is sick enough to need ventilation probably will not recover quickly enough to assist with the outbreak. 

- No assessment of age, chronic illness, disability, or quality of life in the long term. The authors want to leave those cans of worms firmly closed.

- Sorting is done using a checklist of conditions and an standard assessment for organ failure risk. (SOFA).

- A patient who gets a ventilator is reassessed at 2 days, 5 days, 7 days, then every 2 days. 

- A patient triaged to ""red"" might have to wait for a ventilator, but will stay on until reassessed. Keeping red beyond 5 days requires ongoing improvement.

- If a patient shows improvement at 2 days they can be promoted to red. 

- A patient triaged to ""yellow"" can't get or keep a ventilator while red patients are waiting.

- And ""blue"" is lowest priority. This group includes patients whose survival is judged unlikely because of certain conditions. For example, a patient who arrives after needing field CPR would be triaged blue.

- When a ventilator is needed for a higher-priority patient, a blue or yellow patient is chosen at random and their ventilator withdrawn. 

- When levels are equal, the new patient waits.

- As need subsides, surviving yellow then blue patients are given ventilators.

The infant lived in Cook County.

During his update, Gov. Pritzker reiterated that experts have told him that mortality risk among children with COVID-19 is very low. Older adults are at higher risk of severe illness, and more than 85% of deaths in Illinois are among individuals 60 years of age and older.

The governor also announced that McCormick Place will be used as the state’s first field hospital. 3,000 hospital beds will be installed by the end of April.

fls6yco,"The process is definitely complicated, and there are many consumable plastic parts involved, in addition to medications and oxygen.

The actual function of the ventilator machine though is fundamentally very simple: it needs to provide a pressure to force air into the lungs, and it needs to remove that pressure to allow air to be expelled, actions which need to be taken at a regular rhythm.

We can look at ventilators of the 1950s to 1960s to get an idea of what a simple machine consists of. 

This 1950s [""Beaver"" Ventilator](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/ny9cerng?query=%22POLIO%22) used the windshield-wiper motor from a car to move a bellows. The amount of air supplied was easily adjustable by setting the lever on the bellows, and the use of an automotive motor was significant, as these are available en masse and are designed to be very reliable (through development of many generations of cars).

A later [Bird Mark 7](https://www.woodlibrarymuseum.org/museum/item/1003/bird-mark-7-respirator) was operated entirely by air pressure. It uses valves and diaphragms to control its operation. This idea was extended [in a concept developed by the US Army](https://agentgallery.com/objects/rare-1965-prototype-harry-diamond-labs-respirator), which had no moving parts, and used the flow of air through venturis and channels. This ""air-powered"" concept is applied even in modern ventilators, such as the [Go2Vent](https://www.vortran.com/go2vent).

Those examples are to show what ""just good enough"" looks like. [There are modern ventilators with many more ""bells and whistles""](https://www.draeger.com/en-us_us/Hospital/Products/Ventilation-and-Respiratory-Monitoring/ICU-Ventilation-and-Respiratory-Monitoring/Evita-Infinity-V500-ventilator), which are not unimportant. Computers can simulate the ""in-pause-out"" rhythm of natural breathing better, and can continuously gauge how much air someone's lungs can accommodate. This means less possibility that the ventilator will cause lung damage, and fewer re-adjustments needed to make sure enough oxygen is getting instilled.

From a medical perspective, I'm sure the fully-computerized machines are quite helpful. If anything, they save the labor of a clinician who is likely seeing a huge surge in patients. From a practicality perspective though, a machine made from minimal parts is far easier to manufacture, and a machine with no computer or software means less concern with de-bugging complex software. Realistically, I think what will result from car manufacturers such as GM or Tesla is a compromise: a simplified/""ugly"" version of an existing commercial ventilator design.",Endotracheal intubation for the COVID-19 patient -Mt Sinai hospital NYC (starts 10 seconds in),2020-03-28 13:40:05,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqs2i6/endotracheal_intubation_for_the_covid19_patient/

fls9zx1,"Hey, thanks! This was informative and interesting.

Can you really imagine Tesla sending something to the market looking ""ugly""? And this is not a spring-board to cybertruck bashing...

Do you know how automated the things are with regards to figuring out the right pressure? I guess the computer might try to push down some ""safe"" pressure level to begin with, then it regulates up by itself until it reaches a threshold of some sort.Like the statistical safe human lung capacity pressure. If there is such a number :P

Alternatively can you figure this out from an xray perhaps which tells you the size of the lungs, and you measure from this.

When you find how much oxygen is being instilled, do you need to draw blood, or can it figure this out too by oxygen/co2 content of the return air? (the advanced ones)

One last thing I've been wondering about. Can these machines somehow ""suck"" out the moisture with the bacteria that I believe end up killing people after the immune system goes berserk in the lungs too? I guess this might be a silly question as lungs might implode or something from this.

flsf79q,"To preface my answer, I'm not a doctor, I'm an engineer who's studied some biomedical topics.

The pressure I think is a combination of things that can be sensed by the computer, and expertise of the respiratory therapist. Modern ventilators can definitely sense the concentration of O2/CO2 that's entering and leaving the lungs. By also knowing the volume of air delivered (which is measured by the ventilator), they can calculate the amount of oxygen delivered in each breath. Another point of measurement would be the oximeter that is attached to the finger (most people have had one of these done at some point: it's a little clip with a red light).

With those measurements, a modern machine should be able to adjust automatically. For example, if the breath volume decreases, the oxygen concentration can go up to compensate. They can also adjust for the lung's ""compliance"" (literally how much it can stretch and expand). There is definitely an upper limit on the pressure that can be used, and the ventilators are set with this value.

Generally, ventilators don't provide much in the way of suction. Indeed, for pneumonia and similar, they actually keep a little pressure present at the ""end"" of each breath, which keeps the sacs in the lungs inflated and ready for the next breath. A more invasive procedure like bronchoscopy uses a fiber-optic scope to look into the lungs and suction out anything. 

When the lungs are infected with bacterial or viral pneumonia, these pathogens multiply *within* the lung tissue, and lead to inflammation as a protective response by the body. Fluids and secretions are a symptom of this inflammation, so removing them wouldn't stop the infection, but can be needed if there is too much fluid building up.",Endotracheal intubation for the COVID-19 patient -Mt Sinai hospital NYC (starts 10 seconds in),2020-03-28 13:40:05,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqs2i6/endotracheal_intubation_for_the_covid19_patient/

flrv7p3,">**Africa, a ticking time bomb?**

>*COVID-19 spares no one, all continents are affected. But it is on the African continent that we fear the worst.*

>For a continent of nearly 1.3 billion people, Africa has been relatively unscathed by the COVID-19 pandemic to date. The latest news includes nearly 4,000 cases and around 100 deaths.

>However, experts quoted by the journal Science on March 15 describe the pandemic that threatens the African continent as a time bomb.

>COVID-19 reached two countries at war on Wednesday: Libya and Mali. Some countries have started a containment operation, such as Algeria, South Africa and Rwanda.

>Others have declared a state of emergency and are restricting the movement of people, including Senegal and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In this country, a first case was detected Friday outside Kinshasa, despite the complete confinement of the capital.

>South Africa alone accounts for more than a third of the cases on the continent. However, it is suspected that these figures are explained by the fact that the most developed country in Africa is best equipped to test citizens.

>In Nigeria, the most populous country on the continent with 200 million inhabitants, the government argued on Thursday that the country could quickly face an explosion of cases of coronavirus, if the people who were exposed were not detected quickly.

>As early as February, however, when the first case appeared in Egypt, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO), warned Africa that it had to prepare for the worst.

>*Precarious health systems*

>*""Beyond the figures, what we fear is first of all the very fragile health systems of most African countrie""*. - Jean-Jacques Simon, director of communications for UNICEF in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

>Jean-Jacques Simon has traveled Africa back and forth for years. Now director of communications for UNICEF in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he expresses fears for this great country in the face of the arrival of the new coronavirus.

>The health system is unprepared for such an epidemic, he says. There is a system in theory, but in reality it lacks a lot of staff and coordination. It is not for nothing that, last year, there were more than 6000 deaths linked to measles in the country; the vast majority of them were children under the age of five.

>The arrival of COVID-19 on the African continent raises fears of a saturation of health centers, which are already reaching their full performance. By way of comparison, there are 13.1 beds per 1000 inhabitants in hospitals in Japan, 2.5 beds in Canada and 0.8 beds in the DRC.

>The same is true in N'Djamena, Chad, where we joined Hindu Oumarou, a social worker who campaigns for the rights of the Fulani, an indigenous community in the Sahel.

>Even in normal times in his country, health centers lack equipment: There is no gel in hospitals, the number of gloves is limited, imagine with the disease! Doctors are obliged to dress in a special way so as not to contract it; how do you want them to dress properly !, regrets Ms. Oumarou.

>Until February, Africa had only two laboratories capable of diagnosing COVID-19, one in Senegal, the other in South Africa. But the situation has changed, there are now around 40 on the continent.

>The first cargoes of screening tests and masks arrived on the continent, courtesy of the Chinese billionaire Jack Ma. The Ethiopian Airlines airline will deliver in each country 20,000 screening kits, 100,000 masks as well as protective suits for medical use .

>*Difficult physical distance*

>One of the authorities' challenges will be to encourage citizens to adopt practices of physical distancing. Cities are dense, apartments are often small, public transport is crowded.

>This is what Gilles Yabi, the director of Wathi, a think tank on public policies in Dakar, Senegal, notes, where we joined him.

>In daily practice, we have the opposite of social distancing and all the measures that are recommended today. So we know very well that it will be very difficult and that it will not be full compliance with these measures.

>In several very populated cities, many citizens have no choice but to go to the market every day, according to the small income they will have made during the day. Very often people are forced to huddle together in small vans that serve as minibuses to get to work.

>Religious groups, sports groups, lifestyle, the market, these are all places that are at very high risk of transmission, says Jean Lebel, president of the Research Center for International Development (IDRC).

>This great connoisseur of Africa fears that physical distancing measures are very difficult to apply on this continent.

>Often [proximity] is fundamental to maintain the standard of living, to have access to food and services; this is a component that worries the research world a lot, says Lebel.

>Places of worship pose a particular problem. People fear that their faith in God will be called into question and that they will think that they only have faith in this little virus. So, they continue to frequent these places, notes Hindou Oumarou in Chad.

>*Spread the word*

>In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, prevention and awareness campaigns are among the essential tools to contain the crisis.

>Like everywhere on the planet, the authorities must be able to inform the population about the best practices to adopt and the rules that are imposed, which often change from day to day.

>As such, the African continent poses a challenge. What worries me are the rural areas where the information penetrates much less, where there is no radio or cellular signal, says Hindou Oumarou.

>To illustrate this problem, Jean-Jacques Simon quotes the information campaign on measles in the DRC. In 2019, 6,000 people died from this contagious disease, mostly children under the age of five.

>Why have there been so many measles-related deaths? Because we couldn't reach people in vaccination campaigns, says Simon.

>Coverage has barely reached 50% in the country, while 90% would have been necessary to avoid such a wide spread. It shows that there is a problem in the health system. Information is the sinews of war and it is not easy, says Jean-Jacques Simon.

>*From the health crisis to the social crisis*

>If the authorities have put the economy on hold in much of North America and Europe in order to stem the contagion, the operation risks being much more complicated on the African continent.

>We cannot consider the forms of full containment that we apply elsewhere, because in African countries, a very large number of people depend on the informal economy and need to go out every day to be able to earn a living, says Gilles Yabi from the Wathi think tank in Dakar.

>Without a social safety net, it is hard to imagine that we will be able to prevent citizens from going to work. Too many people depend on their meager day-to-day incomes for food and shelter.

>When there are restrictions on the movement of people, on the opening of shops and businesses, it is the poorest who pay because they have nothing to eat, says Jean-Jacques Simon. It can create popular uprisings, quite phenomenal social tensions, he points out.

>Thus, in Africa, there is a risk that the health crisis caused by this small virus a few microns in diameter could turn into a real social revolt in certain countries.","Africa, a ticking time bomb?

flrwbre,"Shortages caused by hoarding on the part of medical professionals for friends and family:

""The influx of prescriptions came after researchers and President Donald Trump talked about the potential for the medication.

""The suspicion – and reality according to pharmacists - is doctors wrote prescriptions for friends and family in anticipation of hydroxychloroquine being a potential coronavirus treatment.

“Some of the reports from the states indicate that doctors were prescribing for themselves and for their friends and stockpiling the medication,” said Carmen Catizone, the executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.

“We are hearing that there have been instances where some prescribers in some hospital pharmacies have been prescribing these medications as a prophylactic drug, or a preventative medication, and it’s creating shortages in the supply system,” Catizone said.""

""Patients want to see doctors monitored to stop hoarding as clinical trials for coronavirus treatments continue.

“People are scared, and I get that. But just because you have the legal ability to write prescriptions and you are scared doesn’t give you some kind of awesome advantage for getting this drug - which we don’t know if it works, which is why there are studies,” Stone, the lupus patient in South Carolina, said.

""Some insurance companies have warned doctors about abusing their prescription-writing powers. Some states have said they will prosecute doctors who inappropriately prescribe.

“Everybody is arguing against people who are stockpiling or going and grabbing up this drug. You can’t do that without a prescription. The doctors who are writing these prescriptions on their ‘friends and family plan’ or whatever are unscrupulous. They need to be prosecuted. They need to be fined. They need to maybe lose their license,” Stone said.""",Pharmacists: Doctors writing prescriptions for possible COVID-19 treatment at expense of chronically-ill patients,2020-03-28 13:57:31,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqsea8/pharmacists_doctors_writing_prescriptions_for/
flrxb46,"What is worse about this than the fact that RA and lupus patients may not get their prescriptions filled is that the doctors doing the prescriptions may not be informing the people they are prescribing for of the potential limitations and guidelines that should be used with hydroxychloroquine. For example, it should not be used in an attempt to prevent the disease, since there is no evidence that it works for that purpose. It also should not be used for patients who have only a mild or moderate form of the disease. It can also result in side effects if there are other drugs the patient is using, some perhaps life threatening. Links below:

flrwk1z,"Kaiser Permanente refuses to fill chloroquine prescriptions for lupus patients, thanks them for their ""sacrifice"":

""The woman in California is out of hydrochloroquine, and she has no prospect of getting it anytime soon.

“I am already at high risk for serious complications should I contract Covid-19. As if that wasn’t stressful enough, I am now unable to access the medication that keeps my immune system from attacking my vital organs, which will cause irreparable damage,” she said.

""She is insured through Kaiser Permanente, which she explained means she is restricted on where she can get prescriptions and care.

""This week, she also received an email from Kaiser Permanente through her health care provider. The patient gave InvestigateTV a copy and wanted to remain anonymous in this story.

""The email stated that the company would be “conserving” its supply of hydroxychloroquine. It said not to contact physicians to attempt to get a refill because they would not be filled – even through an exception process.

""The email stated: “Thank you for the sacrifice you will be making for the sake of those that are critically ill; your sacrifice may actually save lives.”

""For patients, it was a slap in the face during a stressful time.

“The fact that they thanked me for my ‘sacrifice’ is disturbing. If I die as a result of not having access to this medication, are they going to thank my husband and my two sons for their ‘sacrifice’? I never agreed to sacrifice my health and possibly my life and cannot believe that I am being forced to do so,” the California woman wrote to InvestigateTV.

""Kaiser Permanente responded to InvestigateTV’s requests for comment and said this shortage is affecting health care providers everywhere.

“In the past few weeks, this drug also has been identified as having a beneficial impact in the treatment of some severely sick COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized. We face the real possibility of running out of the drug for everyone if we don’t take steps to mitigate the shortage. Kaiser Permanente, like other health care organizations across the country, has taken the unusual step of temporarily restricting use of the medication to ensure access to it for severely sick patients,” a spokesman wrote in an email.",Pharmacists: Doctors writing prescriptions for possible COVID-19 treatment at expense of chronically-ill patients,2020-03-28 13:57:31,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqsea8/pharmacists_doctors_writing_prescriptions_for/

flry005,"The main reason behind this is that the US clinical response to the coronavirus has failed as much as the testing part of the pandemic response in the US has failed.  Most US doctors already know something that you as the public may not know: antivirals work best when you diagnosed and treat a viral disease early.  This is how Medscape's Dr. Auwaerter described it.  Most US doctors already know that if you want to treat for COVID-19, you rather treat early than later before a patient becomes critical.

 https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/927453

But like any antiviral—and we know this from influenza—the earlier you give treatment, the better. For example, oseltamivir is given for influenza virus. If you take it within 6 hours of onset of symptoms, you might abbreviate your duration of illness by 4 days. If you wait until 2 days of illness, it might only abbreviate it by a day. For any antiviral effect, it has to be taken early. ....

Hundreds of thousands of Chinese mouth masks have been recalled from Dutch hospitals

A large part of the mouth masks that the Dutch government has imported from China is unsound. Because the masks were already distributed to hospitals, the Ministry of Health has held a recall.

This concerns almost half of a batch of 1.3 million so-called FFP2 masks, 600,000 pieces. Healthcare providers use it to treat critically ill patients with Covid infection. Faulty masks put doctors and nurses at risk.

The masks have been rejected by TNO because they do not meet the safety requirements. They do not fit well on the face or have membranes that do not function properly, the very fine filters that have to stop virus particles.

The masks were already distributed among the hospitals. ""The mouth masks that are not satisfactory have been retrieved,"" the Ministry of Health told the NOS. ""We have no overview of whether the defective mouth masks have also been used in hospitals.""

Hospitals own initiative

A number of hospitals had the masks tested by TNO on their own initiative. The batch of masks was distributed across the hospitals without being tested to see if they meet the quality requirements.

""When they were delivered to our hospital, I immediately rejected those masks,"" said a person from a hospital who received a batch of defective masks. ""If those masks do not close properly, the virus particles can simply pass. We do not use them. That is unsafe for our people.""

TNO is not allowed to provide information about the results and results of the tests. ""That is contractually stipulated,"" said a spokesperson.

Depressing quality

The rejected mouth masks are said to be of unfortunate quality. Not of FFP2 quality nor of the lesser level of safety FFP1. ""Some sort of FFP0.8 at best,"" said this source.

It is not clear whether the rejected masks are already in use in Dutch hospitals, but that is not imaginary given the large shortages.

""We received 2400 of those masks. They are still in storage, we have not used one,"" says a spokesman for the Radboud umc. There it was seen that the caps did not fit well on the face.

A spokesperson for the Catharina Hospital in Eindhoven says that the shipment was immediately rejected. ""This is not in itself, there is a lot of junk on the market. There are people trying to take advantage of the current crisis, at high prices."" 

Sterilize as an artifice

The source says that the recall has been launched head over heels to get the unsafe masks out of circulation as soon as possible. Several other physicians closely involved in fighting the corona outbreak are concerned about the spread of unsafe protective equipment across the country.

There has been a shortage of good mouth masks for some time. That is why hospitals resort to emergency solutions. They sterilize already used masks and then put them on again.

Written response from the Ministry of VWS

In a written response to the NIS, the ministry states that people and power are being worked to meet the need for protective equipment that is scarce all over the world. ""Due to these shortages, we can find ourselves in a situation where only protective equipment is available that does not meet the highest standards. This is an issue in all countries. The Ministry of VWS and the national consortium work day and night to get the best masks. . ""

""Last Saturday, a first shipment from a Chinese manufacturer was partially delivered. These are masks with a KN95 quality certificate. The Ministry of VWS received a first signal that the quality of this shipment did not meet the criteria during inspection. Part of this shipment was delivered to healthcare providers, the rest of the cargo was immediately put on-hold and was not distributed further. ""

""A second test also showed that the masks did not meet the quality standard. It has now been decided not to use this whole shipment anymore. New shipments will undergo an additional test.""
On the advice of the American CDC, which is the counterpart of our RIVM, the Ministry of VWS has approved the Chinese quality standard KN95 for mouth masks. The minister reported this earlier this week in a letter to the House of Representatives.",Hundreds of thousands of Chinese mouth masks have been recalled from Dutch hospitals,2020-03-28 13:59:38,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqsfpb/hundreds_of_thousands_of_chinese_mouth_masks_have/

flsjgqe,"It's the difference between causation on correlation.   
You can die while you have the virus, or you can die because of the virus.   
So far all deaths reported are virus related. So they have the virus and died. It does not have to be because of the virus.   


However if you look at total number of deaths and not just an indivudual case, you see the virus does cause a lot more deaths. Because the daily average in some countries is 50% above normal.   


For this case, I don't know. I can't tell.   
It's an infant death, so there would probably be an autopsy. But for all the 100 of deaths in Italy for example you can't do more than test for the virus.

It goes like this: 

Me: this is serious, and will overload our medical infrastructure, leading to deaths and poor outcomes non carriers who won’t have access to a ventilator if they need one due to a car accident and lung injury. 

Them: it’s not a dangerous virus.  The only reason the hospitals are overwhelmed is because people who wouldn’t otherwise go to the hospital are choking the system.  If the virus was treated less seriously, only the very ill would go to hospitals, reducing strain. 

Me: but every ventilator in the three closest hospitals to me is in use right now. 

Them: subject change.

Chiba prefecture Japan coronavirus news from  43 days ago

https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f3qmh0/none_of_japans_new_coronavirus_patients_had/

Japan's first domestic coronavirus victim and three patients newly confirmed Thursday (2/13/2020) had no direct connections to China.

This has raised concerns that a stealth outbreak is already under way in the country.

The Japanese government said Thursday that a Kanagawa Prefecture woman in her 80s died from the coronavirus. Her son-in-law also tested positive for the disease.

Additionally, a doctor in Wakayama Prefecture and a man in Chiba Prefecture are confirmed to have the virus. None of them traveled to China recently or had contact with people who visited Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.

The festival evolved from a ritual that started 500 years ago during the Muromachi Period, when villagers competed to grab paper talismans, which were given out by a priest at the Saidaiji Kannonin Temple.

It's one of several ""Naked festivals"" held across Japan, with another held at Yotsukaido in Chiba prefecture, featuring men in loincloths fighting and carrying kids through mud as a method of exorcism

The number of infected individuals continued to rise in Japan on Saturday, when government officials confirmed at least 25 new cases.

Among the cases was a junior high school teacher in the city of Chiba who went to work even though she had symptoms, raising fears the virus could spread among her students and co-workers.

In all reality this drug probably doesn’t help at all but big pharma has jumped on the chance to push this stuff to the detriment of the population of patients with autoimmune conditions who actually need it and benefit from it. Also, the dosing suggestions for use in treating COVID-19 are significantly higher than how it is normally prescribed. The side effects of this drug are serious and can kill people. Any patient that would likely be a candidate for this drug is likely experiencing a more severe, acute infection and, therefore, is likely part of the high risk cohort. This means they probably also have underlying cardiac disease.

Seven ‘Twilight Zone’ episodes that are eerily timely during the coronavirus pandemic

By 

Michael Cavna 

March 28, 2020 at 4:00 a.m. PDT

“The barrier of loneliness: the palpable, desperate need of the human animal to be with his fellow man. Up there … is an enemy known as isolation.” 

So goes creator and host Rod Serling’s closing narration from the debut 1959 episode of “The Twilight Zone,” aptly titled “Where Is Everybody?,” in which a man loses his grip when there is no human companionship to be found anywhere.

Six decades later, “The Twilight Zone” can be found on multiple channels (including MeTV and Syfy) and streaming services (Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video), largely because its themes on the human condition ring eternal. Time travel, cosmic exploration, the power of new technology, the experiences that bedevil us, the nostalgia that summons us — so much of what fascinated Serling speaks to our sense of existential threats, including ways in which shortsighted behavior might hasten our own extinction.

As we live under self-quarantine or enforced lockdown during this covid-19 pandemic of more than a half-million confirmed cases, some “Twilight Zone” stories are especially relevant. Or some episodes of the classic series — which CBS rebooted last year — can be a diverting emotional escape.

Here are seven of the most salient episodes to watch as we shelter from what lies outside our door:

1. “Time Enough at Last”

One person’s mass-casualty event is another person’s opportunity to finally get a little reading done. Burgess Meredith plays the clerk who hides in his bank’s vault to enjoy a few page-turners. When that girded vault allows him to survive a nuclear attack, the clerk is left gloriously alone — just himself and stacks of books to happily devour. The twist, of course, is to watch his step — isolation isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.

(If you like this episode, also consider: “Static.”)

2. “The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street”

Do humans help or harm each other in times of crisis? Serling’s Maple Street is first presented as a benign slice of American society, but suspicion that an alien is among these neighbors sparks fearful finger-pointing, and conflicts escalate. When panic sets in, the monsters, of course, can be ourselves. “There are weapons,” Serling says in voice-over, “that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices.” 

(If you like this episode, also consider: “Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?”)

3. “The Lonely”

How close do we grow to our devices in times of isolation? Imagine, if you will, a convict played by Jack Warden serving his solitary confinement truly alone on a sandy asteroid. Once his penalty appears to be a life sentence, the desperate prisoner is given a “female” robot that he develops feelings for. An intervention is required to remind him that he has come to love a companion made of only nuts and bolts. Sometimes, it seems, the illusory warmth of our machines must be destroyed.

(If you like this episode, also consider: “I Sing the Body Electric.”)

4. “The Mind and the Matter”

Jean-Paul Sartre said that “hell is other people,” and the office worker (Shelley Berman) in this episode would agree. He can’t stand all the crowding, whether it’s along the subway commute or in the lunchtime cafeteria. Yet when he lives his dream to eliminate all people, the loneliness makes for an awfully empty life. Serling’s question is clear: Are we really meant to spend so much time alone?

(If you like this episode, also consider: “Sounds and Silences.”)

5. “The Shelter”

What will cause even the best of friends and spouses to turn on each other? In this story by Lamont Johnson, dear old pals gather for a birthday party, but a UFO sighting and talk of a possible nuclear attack drive a psychological wedge between the cozy neighbors. A doctor, for so long a healer, must weigh the prospect of loved ones perishing outside his bomb shelter. What is harder when self-preservation is at stake: a reinforced shelter door or the human heart?

(If you like this episode, also consider: “The Midnight Sun.”)

6. “The Whole Truth”

As global leaders play politics, what becomes of a man who must tell the truth? In this episode, a used-car salesman (Jack Carson) suddenly loses his ability to traffic in lies. But, like a clever politician, the salesman can still bend the facts to his favor in this Cold War tale, which delivers a humorous twist when a rival nation is interested in a “haunted” auto.

(If you like this episode, also consider: “Hocus-Pocus and Frisby” and “It’s a Good Life.”)

7. “Where Is Everybody?” 

What if everywhere you turned — to movies, to the kitchen, to the streets outside — you could not find another person? A man in an Air Force flight suit (Earl Holliman) seems to be living that “existence.” Serling himself had seen battle, jumping out of World War II planes, and he surely knew that mental duress could be the toughest test.

I get that part - there's a lot to mull over and a lot that can be missed. It's having to deal with the consequences without much of a second look that bothers me. 

Unless this bill is due for an amendment within the near future (near as in days), it seems like powerful people will receive a bonus while the rest of us watch in silence. I know that the opposite of silence in this situation is voting, but it feels so obviously corrupt to watch lawmakers move on - patting the dust off their shoulders and shaking hands across the aisle.","Bonanza for Rich Real Estate Investors, Tucked Into Stimulus Package",2020-03-28 14:48:25,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqtd0d/bonanza_for_rich_real_estate_investors_tucked/

I hope delaying non essential items has helped ease the burden of walking from 1 side of the warehouse for a dog sweater to the other for 2 boxes of cheese-itz and a light bulb a bit.

fls4ypc,"What this is all linking to is the microbiome.
To quote directly from the article in the summary section at the end (if you all want to visit it..):


Finally, this study has identified three compounds (TF2B, TF3 and tannic acid) that are effective 3CLPro inhibitors (IC50 ≤10 µM). These compounds are abundant in the extract of black tea (16,19). 

Results from this study warrant further investigation to examine the effect of these natural products in inhibition of SARS-CoV replication in cell culture. Clark et al. reported that theaflavins extracted from black tea were able to neutralize bovine coronavirus and rotavirus infections (20). Thus, it will be very interesting to evaluate, in a separate study, whether drinking black tea can prevent or alleviate the infection of an enteric form of coronavirus **since SARS-CoV is known to actively replicate in the intestinal tract**

fls4v7k,"So... if I'm reading this correctly, they want to investigate whether drinking black tea helps mitigate infection with forms of coronavirus that mainly populate in the gut.

Would that apply to COVID-19? We know it exists in the gut because it's present in feces, but as far as I know, people with gut symptoms usually follow a non-serious route. People with respiratory infection are the ones who get serious.

So this would suggest to me that *drinking* black tea would be an inefficient way of testing this since it doesn't tell us anything about people who actually get truly ill. It would be more useful to convert it into some other form...

Both toddlers and children have lower risk for sever and critical symptoms, but severe symptoms did happen too. Some needed ventilators and ICU.

From outside it seems that the government is/was pretty clueless on how to act.,"Caught Between Herd Immunity And National Lockdown, Holland Hit Hard By Covid-19",2020-03-28 15:25:05,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqu1pr/caught_between_herd_immunity_and_national/
flsfpic,"To clarify the general situation in the Netherlands a little: the initial spread was largely caused by people returning from vacations in Italy and then attending the yearly large-scale carnival festivities held across the south of the Netherlands, greatly spreading the virus before anyone even knew much about it other than that it was a situation over in Wuhan.

There were no direct flights from Wuhan to the Netherlands, so the assumption was that an outbreak was unlikely, especially with China locking down travel and there being few reported cases outside of China. The Netherlands approached it like the U.S, except without the government lying and downplaying the outbreak until it became too large to handle. When it became clear there was an outbreak, the Dutch government immediately created a [financial safety net](https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-dutch-government-adopts-package-of-new-measures-designed-to-save-jobs-and-the-economy) so businesses and individuals would not face undue financial risk during and after the crisis. Doing this early on meant everyone could isolate without fear of losing their livelihood.

The window for initial containment had already passed due to the virus aggressively spreading during the festivities in both Italy and the Netherlands. Had it occurred at any other time, the impact might have been less severe, but hindsight is 20/20. The  Netherlands is also one of the [most densely populated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_Netherlands#Population_size) countries in the world, which greatly increases the risk of viral spread.

With early containment no longer possible, a possible vaccine being over a year away and infection of a large number of people likely, a method of controlled spread was adopted. **Possible** large-scale immunity in the long term was a side effect of that approach, not the goal. The media just ran with that narrative. The goal was maximum mitigation and protection of the most vulnerable under the assumption that the outbreak would be a long-term issue that would not go away. That way hospitals would not be overwhelmed, and there would be time to proactively look for solutions rather than being one step behind at any given time.

The problem is that the way the Netherlands typically operates is to try and [reach consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polder_model) with all parties before resorting to regulation and enforcement. Which works very well, but not in this situation. While the government banned large gatherings and  closed schools and restaurants, they only asked for people to isolate and distance themselves rather than enforce it. The Dutch have a deeply embedded cultural dislike to overreactions, so the initial mindset was that everything would be fine, because that's how it's always worked, and that this sort of crisis was reserved for other countries.

Isolation and social distancing measures were observed, but not strict enough. It was only after the outbreak started to really strain hospitals that people realized this was the real deal. A good healthcare system is great, but it won't do you much good if you start running out of hospital beds, staff and equipment.

The vast majority of people have since realized the severity of the situation. Self-isolation and social distancing measures are widely observed, and the numbers for new infections and deaths appear to be declining after some weeks of large-scale isolation. The expectation is that a trend in the number of cases should become apparent next week. If it hasn't worked, stricter measures and enforcement will likely come into play.

In terms of number of deaths, the Netherlands generally offers palliative care more quickly than many other countries. If the prognosis for the patient is very poor, with the patient almost certainly not surviving treatment or coming out of the treatment with severely reduced quality of life, the patient and physician may decide together that end-of-life care may be a kinder option. These patients are not subjected to a prolonged, painful death that may take several weeks, but die in palliative care outside of an ICU. Because many of the critically ill patients are elderly or have severe underlying health issues, these cases comprise a large majority of the COVID-19 deaths in the Netherlands. And since these patients are not kept alive against all odds for several weeks, the initial number of deaths skews higher.","Caught Between Herd Immunity And National Lockdown, Holland Hit Hard By Covid-19",2020-03-28 15:25:05,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqu1pr/caught_between_herd_immunity_and_national/

A vaccine for this virus is very very far off. Isolation for this period of time is not realistic. A vaccine for SARS still does not exist.

We must protect the vulnerable so they are the ones who benefit from herd immunity without having to contract it.

 (1) do not ignore unexplained foul smells in bathrooms, kitchens, or wash areas; 

 (2) make sure that all water appliances in bathrooms and kitchens are fitted with a functioning U-bend; 

 (3) to prevent the loss of the water trap seal within a U-bend, open a tap on all water appliances for at least 5 s twice a day (morning and evening) paying special attention to floor drains in bathrooms and wet rooms;

 (4) if the wastewater pipework from an appliance appears to be disconnected or open, seal it immediately (ie, use an elastic rubber glove to cover the end; a plastic bag and some tape will suffice, ensuring the bag has no holes);

 (5) if there appears to be any crack or leak in pipework, seal with tape or glue; and

There are two China mortality figures. In Hubei, the case fatality rate was over 5%, due to its hospital system being swamped. In other places that have experienced the same problem - northern Italy, Spain - we have seen the same thing. But in China outside of Hubei, and in South Korea, the CFR is closer to 1%. Availability of medical intervention must at the very least be taken into account, and also the demographics, since the CFR of Covid-19 is strongly age-dependent.",The Lancet: Real estimates of mortality following COVID-19 infection,2020-03-28 15:42:11,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqucw0/the_lancet_real_estimates_of_mortality_following/

flsflzv,"You are absolutely right, don’t let any downvotes deter you. There’s a huge counter jerk going on that doesn’t even make sense with how delusional and optimistic they are. Every single sign is pointing to an IFR of 5-6%, maybe even higher. This is deadly as fuck, even in the age of modern medicine. This is a milder, magnitudes more infectious SARS. It takes weeks to recover from and has an insane hospitalization rate. It’s pretty unprecedented. People keep going off the logic of, “It can’t be THAT much deadlier than the flu, so let’s work backwards off the assumption that the IFR is a *reasonable* 1-3%.”

No. That’s not how that works. In no scenario in reality is this 1% at the end of the day. Just throw that number out. Many studies have come out already showing the “iceberg” effect of people who stay asymptomatic throughout the duration of illness is not nearly enough to make the CFR be divided by 6. About 50% of the positive cases in Iceland were asymptomatic at the time of testing, with no follow up yet to see if those people eventually became symptomatic. About 18 percent of Diamond Princess positive cases remained asymptomatic until recovery. China was largely the same, about 15-20% remained asymptomatic until recovery",The Lancet: Real estimates of mortality following COVID-19 infection,2020-03-28 15:42:11,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqucw0/the_lancet_real_estimates_of_mortality_following/

 Real estimates of mortality following COVID-19 infection
As of March 1, 2020, 79 968 patients in China and 7169 outside of China had tested positive for coronavirus
1
disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among
Chinese patients, 2873 deaths had occurred, equivalent to a mortality rate of 3·6% (95% CI 3·5–3·7), while 104 deaths from COVID-19 had been reported outside of China (1·5% [1·2–1·7]). However, these mortality rate estimates are based on the number of deaths relative to the number of confirmed cases of infection, which is not representative of the actual death rate; patients who die on any given day were infected much earlier, and thus the denominator of the mortality rate should be the total number of patients infected at the same time as those who died. Notably, the full denominator remains unknown because asymptomatic cases or patients with very mild symptoms might not be tested and will not be identified. Such cases therefore cannot be included in the estimation of actual mortality rates, since actual estimates pertain to clinically apparent COVID-19 cases.
The maximum incubation period
is assumed to be up to 14 days,2
whereas the median time from onset
of symptoms to intensive care unit
(ICU) admission is around 10 days.3,4
Recently, WHO reported that the
time between symptom onset and
death ranged from about 2 weeks to
8 weeks.
We re-estimated mortality rates by
dividing the number of deaths on a given day by the number of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection 14 days before. On this basis, using WHO data on the cumulative number of deaths to March 1, 2020, mortality rates would be 5·6% (95% CI 5·4–5·8) for China and 15·2% (12·5–17·9) outside of China. Global mortality rates over time using a 14-day delay estimate are shown in the figure, with a curve that levels off to a rate of 5·7% (5·5–5·9), converging with the current WHO estimates. Estimates will increase if a longer delay between onset of illness and death is considered. A recent time- delay adjusted estimation indicates that mortality rate of COVID-19 could be as high as 20% in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.6 These findings show that the current figures might underestimate the potential threat of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients.

4. Both Elon Musk and Donald Trump spoke publicly about it which raised the profile of the drug and brought it to public attention.

I just spoke with a friend whose father is being treated with chloroquine and azithromycin under compassionate use in NJ.

According to Dr. Tam:

There are 5,153 cases of COVID-19 and 55 people have died as a result of the disease in Canada

Approximately seven per cent of people with COVID-19 require hospitalization; three per cent become critically ill; and one per cent of cases are fatal.

30 per cent of hospitalized cases involve people under 40 years of age.

According to the data:

People over the age of 60 have the highest rate of hospitalizations making up 56 per cent of hospital admissions and 52 per cent of people needing intensive care.

Individuals aged 40-59 had the highest proportion of cases (34 per cent), followed by those 20-39 years of age (28 per cent) and 60-79 years of age (23 per cent).

88 per cent of new cases identified this past week are from community transmission rather than travellers arriving from abroad.

62 per cent of the documented cases included enough information for the public health agency to include them in the epidemiological summary; only 35 per cent of the reported cases include information on the rate of hospitalization.",People under 40 account for nearly one-third of hospitalized cases of COVID-19: public health agency,2020-03-28 16:17:53,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fquzgr/people_under_40_account_for_nearly_onethird_of/

I live in Paisley, Scotland, for the most part it looks like my area are taking advice, but i’ve been at my local Asda or Aldi a few times, my local Asda mate it 15 customers at a time, then reduced it too 10.. this lasted a day as queues were ridiculous outside so now its just back to normal, 2 metre distance rule inside the store which nobody is adhering to with no staff wearing PPE at all, not even gloves! My partner is a store assistant in another big store, we have a 1 year old son, shes apparently an essential worker yet none of them have been provided with the most basic PPE!

He asked if the patient was at high risk for COVID infection. When I explained that he was not, he told me to immediately take off my mask. When I refused, he ripped it off my face, stating: 'You are giving patients the impression that COVID is far worse than it is.'""

​
> Attending Physician, NY: “I was just placed on administrative leave indefinitely because I sent an email to the entire administrative team of the health system where I work, questioning (firmly) why they had yet to create an operationalized system that hospital staff and physicians could follow so positive COVID patients in our hospital could be separated from those who did not have it.""

​
> Attending Physician, TX: “I overheard the CFO from our hospital system tell our hospital president that they were allocating insurance reimbursement money as a potential bonus opportunity to hospital administrators who were able to stay on budget without costing them more amid this COVID (and I quote) 'shit-show.'”

​
> Attending Physician, SC: “I recently came down with a low-grade fever and chills. I emailed my clinic manager suggesting I be tested for COVID. I was told not to test due to the need for me in the clinic and to wait until I was showing signs of shortness of breath. I didn’t realize that the administrators running the show had in their spare time, obtained a degree to practice medicine.”

​
> Medical Assistant, CA: “After a Zoom meeting where we were told we no longer needed to wear PPE if we were not within two feet of an ill patient, I asked the director of health services in our healthcare system running the meeting if exceptions could be made for those individuals who were immune-compromised like myself, since I had just returned to work after a short leave due to treatment for breast cancer.

The largest reason is its a big unknown, the amount of work to inspect and test countless hand made masks isn’t worth the effort.

In most cases it’s likely safer for them to reuse 95 masks than to use a home made mask from a random (but kind hearted) person.

The only case where a home made mask would be used is when the only alternative is not wearing a mask at all.

flsghaj,"LOUISVILLE, Ky., (WDRB) – Two Louisville residents have filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against their former employer, claiming they were fired after complaining the business was not properly protecting employees from the coronavirus.

Robbie Payne and Erica Shaw allege their concerns about sick employees and a lack of social distancing to the owner of Radio Communications Systems were “brushed off,” according to the lawsuit, filed Friday in Jefferson Circuit Court.

The owner, Perry Bond, characterized COVID-19 as “not that big of an issue” and said everyone was “overreacting,” even after a sick employee was ordered by a doctor to self-quarantine, according to the suit.

Another employee who traveled frequently, fell ill after going to a country hit hard by the coronavirus, according to the suit.

“The worker was sent home, but the company took almost no steps to determine whether the rest of the workers were safe,” the suit claims.

Bond could not immediately be reached for comment. A woman who answered the phone at Radio Communications said she would pass along a message to Bond. 

Lawsuits present only one side of a case. The attorneys for Payne and Shaw could also not be reached for comment. 

After Shaw expressed her concern with human resources, Bond met with her and  “laughed” at her worrying about a co-worker who had left work the previous day because she felt sick.

“Oh, she has a cough,” Bond allegedly said. “I had a cough yesterday.”

He also allegedly told Shaw “if you don’t feel safe at this company, there’s the door,” according to the suit. She was fired later that day when Bond allegedly approached her desk and said, ""You know what? Pack your things up. Today is your last day.""

The next day, March 20, Payne was also fired, when he went to see Bond about another issue. . Bond allegedly told him that someone had filed a harassment claim against him. Bond did not provide other details, and Payne said he was “falsely accused” by Bond, according to the suit.

""Mr. Bond lied to Mr. Payne in order to provide a pretextual basis for the termination,"" according to the suit. 

Payne and Shaw claim they were then “terminated because of their concern for their fellow employees and themselves in the face” of a pandemic, the lawsuit claims.

The pair allege they were trying to follow orders of Gov. Andy Beshear for businesses that remained open, including maintaining a six-foot difference and ensuring sick employees remained at home.

Payne was a warehouse manager and Shaw an administrative assistant until they were fired.

Radio Communications sells wireless communications systems, including two-way radios.

The lawsuit is seeking a jury trial and unspecified monetary damages.  ",Lawsuit:Two Louisville workers fired for complaining company wasn't following coronavirus guidelines,2020-03-28 17:05:47,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqvsja/lawsuittwo_louisville_workers_fired_for/

It's a pity not many people are listening to the Epidemiologists, Virologists, and Microbiologists, who know better and have recommended from the start to WEAR a face mask. As long as they are worn PROPERLY, they DO work.

Why do you think asian countries wear them? They got over the 2003 SARS outbreak in several months because they wore them! And they haven't forgotten what it did to them.

The WHO and the CDC have contradicted themselves so many times since this Covid-19 outbreak with what they have told people what and what not to do. Their 'health experts"" have constantly back-peddled on their ""recommendations"" they have given people.

* Fewer pages since the graphs now support all modes in the options
* Improved mobile experience
* Added a Current Day Updates with respective forecast for the selected countries
* Added Daily progression to show the detailed progression of the numbers of a selected country.
* Added Mortality per Cases page to give some idea how a country is cooping with the massive flood of cases.
* If no countries were previously selected it will have a default subset in order to avoid performance issues with graphs with too much data.
* Improvements to design.
* Many other small changes and improvements.

EDIT:

To be clear - I work with Ag. I interact with people in Ag every day who are doing literally nothing to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and who view Covid-19 as ""just the flu"" or ""a plot by the Democrats to impeach Trump"". These are some of the same folks who aren't doing the basics like washing their hands, avoiding unnecessary social gatherings, or coughing into their elbows, I might add. And I'm not talking about some area where there are no Covid-19 cases - I'm talking about right smack in the middle of California.

It's weird that sharing this observation is getting down-voted, because it's a very clear observable phenomenon. I suppose people just don't like to think about it. It's extremely unfortunate, because it's going to hurt our ag industry pretty badly - which is something that, putting it mildly, would not be great.

That's what I mean when I say it is sad that the struggling farmers impacted by Covid-19 are also the same people exacerbating the problem. It's like a hungry snake eating its own tail.

flshhv3,"Data from NY is 5 days behind. (Cuomo said today there is 5 day delay to get test results)

Someone in Florida said 12 days since test, no results yet.

If these statements are true, the curves from hard hit places, so far, only represent the increase in testing capabilities.

One should look at the ratio of ""positive results per tests ran per day"" to get better idea of the virus spread. eg.

Day 5 we ran 100 tests, 10 positive (10%)

Day 6 we ran 150 tests, 15 positive (10%)

Would mean the virus-spread-situation is same between day 5 and 6.

With this type of reporting (currently prevalent everywhere) we only see increase of new cases per day is 5, without knowing if it is due to spread of virus or increase in test capacity.

Or we could report like this:

Day 5 we ran 100 tests, 10 positive (10%)

Day 6 we ran 150 tests, 20 positive (13%)

Now this would indicate increased spread, and increased testing capacity, but would be able to distinguish between the two.

fltcjki,"Here in NY I haven't seen panic-buying in weeks. Sure, there were a few days when people did silly stuff with toilet paper and hand sanitizer, but that's long past. 

Now, 3 weeks later, people are increasingly focusing on having enough food buffered to minimize shopping trips since the rate of infected people in the area is going to spike over the next month.

Under normal circumstances I plan 1 week of meals at a time. Now I'm trying to keep 4 weeks  planned. It's not just the risk of getting infected--it's the uncertainty around a quickly developing situation. 

I haven't had anything enter or leave the house in 10 days. My next opportunity to have groceries delivered is five days away and I'll be trying to expand that 4-week buffer to 6 weeks. And when I buy those groceries, I'll be buying for a couple of other families to help them stay isolated. 

Will my large order make me look to you like a panic shopper? Maybe, but this isn't panic buying. There are people who cannot isolate for many reasons, but I am not one of them.

fltdq0k,"> Quarantines or lockdowns (different countries call it differently) have been implemented in parts of America, Italy, and China

Exactly, PARTS of America, Italy and China.

US ""Lockdown"", all road, rail and domestic flight transport remains open, India shut all that down. My friends in the Bay area told me that they were still going out until last week for hikes and hanging out generally.

China - Their lockdown was limited to Hubei province, do you realize we are locking down India, see the difference ? Hubei province ? India ? 

Italy - They also locked down only Lombardy and we saw the videos where people escaped down south. 

India locked down the entire country, yes in a country of 1300 million, a few million will be inconvenienced, that's just the way things will be and the state governments are working on it, it will take time but IMO most issues will be settled a week in.

> And we are seeing Indian police beating up people going out to buy groceries as well as food delivery people. Is it common for Indian households to have 21 days worth of food in their homes? If not, how are people going to eat? We are not talking about panic buying, which happens everywhere. But why are police stopping people from buying foods and supplies?

The PM messed up his messaging, the police took it at face value, it's getting better now. IMO they are doing it for the good of the people, it's sad to hear, but today I've heard vehicles running around all day long with the police being lax. I hope they become stricter, obviously beating people isn't the way but it isn't like people are very compliant here either, so what probably works in your country, doesn't necessarily work in India.",India defiant as millions struggle under lockdown,2020-03-28 17:41:34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fqwe58/india_defiant_as_millions_struggle_under_lockdown/

The mortality of the virus is low, but if people dont get treatment because there isnt a way to do that since every hospital is full of sick people, the mortality will be way higher, even among the young.

fltkqab,"Interestingly  Johan Gieseck said yesterday that epidemiologists ”have too much power” in Sweden. Gieseck is the former Swedish state epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency (before Anders Tegnell).

Gieseck’s point is that the Swedish government trusts one man’s opinion too much (Tegnell in this case). He said the politicians should use their own initiative rather than blindly trusting the experts on everything. By law the Swedish government has to refer to experts in cases of disease control but the politicians still have the freedom of making their own decisions.

For example the Danish and Norwegian Public Health agencies advised against closing the schools but politicians in both countries decided to close them anyway.

I have no interest in getting doxxed so I'm going to be vague, but things are really bad for him at the moment, someone is on a ventilator and will probably die within the next few days. For me it is such a strange coincidence that I've started to question whether karma might in fact be real in some cases, as crazy as that may sound. I've even started to assume that death is coming for me or a family member next because when I initially heard about my coworker's ""situation"" I had a moment of schadenfraude, literally FUCKING ONE MOMENT. But since then I have felt so guilty and I've tried to convince myself that the moment of schadenfraude never actually occurred, but let's face it, it did happen. And now things are falling apart for me as well (in relation to this illness) and someone is soon likely about to die that I care about.

Most people who go much higher than that, will experience some stomach discomfort and possibly diarrhea. Also ascorbic acid is not vitamin C. Vitamin C is a living complex with ascorbic acid being a fraction. You also need rutin, hesperadin, bioflavinoids and others to complete the complex. From my experience if you want to work up to 4000 mg or higher, start with a 1000 mg for a week and move to 2000 mg the next week. If you have any issues, cut back 500 mg.

Why? Because she requested “social distancing” at the governor’s briefings. Days earlier, our reporter asked that the governor’s staff help protect reporters by holding Zoom-style video conference press briefings so that questions could be asked without requiring reporters to gather in close proximity. Typically, those press briefings are held in a small room with up to 20 cramped reporters.
